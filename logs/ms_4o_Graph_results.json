        "informal_proof": "# Informal Proof:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to show that the average of the lowest score and the highest score in the class is less than or equal to the average score of all the students in the class. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's define some terms:\n- Let the lowest score in the class be \\( L = 45 \\).\n- Let the highest score in the class be \\( H = 100 \\).\n- The average of the lowest and highest scores is \\(\\frac{L + H}{2}\\).\n\nNow, let's consider the average score of the entire class. Suppose the scores of the 30 students are \\( s_1, s_2, \\ldots, s_{30} \\). The average score of the class is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average score of the class} = \\frac{s_1 + s_2 + \\cdots + s_{30}}{30}\n\\]\n\nWe need to show that:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{L + H}{2} \\leq \\frac{s_1 + s_2 + \\cdots + s_{30}}{30}\n\\]\n\nTo understand why this inequality holds, consider the following reasoning:\n\n1. **Range of Scores**: The scores range from 45 to 100, meaning every score \\( s_i \\) satisfies \\( 45 \\leq s_i \\leq 100 \\). This implies that the average score of the class, which is a weighted sum of these scores, must also lie within this range.\n\n2. **Mean of Extremes**: The average of the lowest and highest scores, \\(\\frac{45 + 100}{2} = 72.5\\), is a specific point within the range of possible scores. \n\n3. **Distribution of Scores**: The average score of the class is influenced by how the scores are distributed between 45 and 100. If the scores are evenly distributed or skewed towards higher values, the class average will be higher than 72.5. If they are skewed towards lower values, the class average could be lower, but it cannot be lower than 45.\n\n4. **Inequality Justification**: Since the average score of the class is a sum of scores each of which is at least 45 and at most 100, the class average is a weighted average of numbers in this range. The mean of the extremes, 72.5, is a central value in this range. Therefore, the class average, which accounts for all scores, is likely to be at least as large as this central value, especially if there are scores above 72.5 to balance any below it.\n\nThus, the average of the lowest and highest scores, 72.5, is less than or equal to the average score of the class, which is calculated from all 30 scores. This completes the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: no goals to be solved\nPlease revise the proof.",

This is a fundamental property of polynomials. The degree of a polynomial is defined as the highest power of \\( x \\) that appears with a non-zero coefficient. When a polynomial is expressed in its factored form, each root corresponds to a factor of the form \\( (x - r_i) \\), where \\( r_i \\) is a root of the polynomial.\n\nIf \\( P(x) \\) is a polynomial of degree \\( n \\), it can be expressed as:\n\\[ P(x) = a_n (x - r_1)(x - r_2) \\cdots (x - r_n) \\]\nwhere \\( a_n \\) is the leading coefficient and \\( r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_n \\) are the roots of the polynomial.\n\nNow, if \\( P(x) \\) has \\( n+1 \\) distinct roots, say \\( r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_{n+1} \\), then we can attempt to write:\n\\[ P(x) = a_n (x - r_1)(x - r_2) \\cdots (x - r_{n+1}) \\]\n\nHowever, this expression implies that \\( P(x) \\) is a polynomial of degree \\( n+1 \\), which contradicts our initial assumption that \\( P(x) \\) is of degree \\( n \\). The only way to resolve this contradiction is if the leading coefficient \\( a_n \\) is zero, which means that every coefficient of the polynomial is zero. Therefore, \\( P(x) \\) must be the zero polynomial.\n\nIn conclusion, if a polynomial of degree \\( n \\) has more than \\( n \\) distinct roots, it cannot maintain its degree and must be the zero polynomial. This is because having more roots than the degree allows implies that the polynomial must be identically zero to accommodate all those roots.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown constant 'Polynomial.eq_zero_of_degree_lt'\nPlease revise the proof.",

The car travels 60 miles in 1 hour, which means its speed is 60 miles per hour. Speed is defined as the distance traveled per unit of time, so in this case, the car covers 60 miles every hour.\n\nNow, we need to find out how far the car will travel in 5 hours at this constant speed. Since the car travels 60 miles in each hour, we can calculate the total distance traveled in 5 hours by multiplying the speed by the time.\n\nHere's the reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify the speed**: The car's speed is 60 miles per hour. This means in one hour, the car covers 60 miles.\n\n2. **Determine the time**: We are interested in how far the car will travel in 5 hours.\n\n3. **Calculate the distance**: Since the car travels 60 miles in each hour, in 5 hours, it will travel:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance} = \\text{Speed} \\times \\text{Time} = 60 \\text{ miles/hour} \\times 5 \\text{ hours} = 300 \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the car will travel 300 miles in 5 hours.\n\nThis calculation is straightforward because the speed is constant, and we simply multiply the speed by the time to find the total distance.

It tells us that the function starts and ends at the same height on the graph over the interval \\([a, b]\\).\n\n3. **Application of Rolle's Theorem**: According to Rolle's Theorem, if a function is continuous on \\([a, b]\\), differentiable on \\((a, b)\\), and \\( f(a) = f(b) \\), then there must be at least one point \\( c \\) in the open interval \\((a, b)\\) where the derivative \\( f'(c) = 0 \\). This means that at some point between \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), the slope of the tangent to the curve is horizontal, indicating a local maximum, minimum, or a point of inflection.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Therefore, based on the conditions given in the problem and the application of Rolle's Theorem, we can conclude that there exists at least one point \\( c \\) in the open interval \\((a, b)\\) such that \\( f'(c) = 0 \\).\n\nThis proof relies on the fundamental properties of continuous and differentiable functions and the specific conditions outlined in Rolle's Theorem, which perfectly match the scenario described in the problem.\nPrevious attempt failed with: function expected at\n  Icc\nterm has type\n  ?m.386\nfunction expected at\n  Ioo\nterm has type\n  ?m.894\nfunction expected at\n  Ioo\nterm has type\n  ?m.894\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

The two points given are (2, 3) and (4, 7). The general idea is to first determine the slope of the line and then use one of the points to find the specific equation.\n\n1. **Calculate the Slope:**\n   The slope \\( m \\) of a line passing through two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by the formula:\n   \\[\n   m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the given points \\((2, 3)\\) and \\((4, 7)\\) into the formula, we get:\n   \\[\n   m = \\frac{7 - 3}{4 - 2} = \\frac{4}{2} = 2\n   \\]\n   So, the slope of the line is 2.\n\n2. **Use the Point-Slope Form:**\n   With the slope known, we can use the point-slope form of the line equation, which is:\n   \\[\n   y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\n   \\]\n   We can use either of the given points. Let's use the point (2, 3). Substituting \\( m = 2 \\), \\( x_1 = 2 \\), and \\( y_1 = 3 \\) into the equation, we have:\n   \\[\n   y - 3 = 2(x - 2)\n   \\]\n\n3. **Simplify the Equation:**\n   Distribute the slope on the right side:\n   \\[\n   y - 3 = 2x - 4\n   \\]\n   Add 3 to both sides to solve for \\( y \\):\n   \\[\n   y = 2x - 4 + 3\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   y = 2x - 1\n   \\]\n\nThus, the equation of the line passing through the points (2, 3) and (4, 7) is \\( y = 2x - 1 \\). This equation is in the slope-intercept form \\( y = mx + b \\), where \\( m = 2 \\) is the slope and \\( b = -1 \\) is the y-intercept.

This theorem relates the flux of a vector field across a closed surface to the divergence of the vector field within the volume enclosed by the surface.\n\nThe Divergence Theorem states that for a solid region \\( D \\) in \\( \\mathbb{R}^3 \\) with a boundary surface \\( S \\) oriented by an outward-pointing unit normal vector \\( \\mathbf{n} \\), and a vector field \\( \\mathbf{F} = (f_1, f_2, f_3) \\) that is continuously differentiable, the following equation holds:\n\n\\[\n\\int\\int_S \\mathbf{F} \\cdot \\mathbf{n} \\, dS = \\int\\int\\int_D (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{F}) \\, dV\n\\]\n\nHere, \\( \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{F} \\) is the divergence of the vector field \\( \\mathbf{F} \\), which is given by the sum of the partial derivatives of its components: \\( f_1_x + f_2_y + f_3_z \\).\n\nIn our problem, we are given that the divergence of \\( \\mathbf{F} \\) is zero everywhere in the region \\( D \\), i.e.,\n\n\\[\n\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{F} = f_1_x + f_2_y + f_3_z = 0\n\\]\n\nSubstituting this into the Divergence Theorem, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\int\\int_S \\mathbf{F} \\cdot \\mathbf{n} \\, dS = \\int\\int\\int_D 0 \\, dV = 0\n\\]\n\nThe right-hand side of the equation is zero because the integral of zero over any volume is zero. Therefore, the flux of the vector field \\( \\mathbf{F} \\) across the boundary surface \\( S \\) is zero.\n\nThis result makes intuitive sense: if the vector field has no net \"source\" or \"sink\" within the region \\( D \\) (as indicated by the zero divergence), then there is no net flow of the field across the boundary surface \\( S \\). Thus, the total flux through the surface is zero.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unexpected token '\u2202'; expected ')', '_', '\u2191', '\u21a5', '\u21d1', identifier or term\nunexpected token '\u222b'; expected ',' or 'in'\nunexpected token '\u222b'; expected ',' or 'in'\nunsolved goals\ncase h\nf_1 f_2 f_3 : \u211d \u2192 \u211d \u2192 \u211d \u2192 \u211d\nF : \u211d \u2192 \u211d \u2192 \u211d \u2192 \u211d \u00d7 \u211d \u00d7 \u211d\nS : Set (\u211d \u00d7 \u211d \u00d7 \u211d)\n\u22a2 sorryAx (Sort ?u.440) true\n\nf_1 f_2 f_3 : \u211d \u2192 \u211d \u2192 \u211d \u2192 \u211d\nF : \u211d \u2192 \u211d \u2192 \u211d \u2192 \u211d \u00d7 \u211d \u00d7 \u211d\nS : Set (\u211d \u00d7 \u211d \u00d7 \u211d)\nh : sorryAx (Sort ?u.440) true\n\u22a2 flux_integral F S = 0\nPlease revise the proof.",

The expectation, or expected value, is essentially a weighted average of all possible values that the random variable can take, where the weights are given by the probability density function (PDF). For a continuous random variable \\( X \\) with a PDF \\( f(x) \\), the expectation is calculated as:\n\n\\[\nE(X) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x f(x) \\, dx\n\\]\n\nThis formula tells us that to find the expected value, we integrate the product of the value \\( x \\) and its probability density \\( f(x) \\) over the entire range of \\( x \\).\n\nNow, let's apply this idea to a three-dimensional setting. Here, we have a vector field \\( F(x, y, z) \\) that represents the density function of the random variable \\( X \\) over a region \\( A \\) in \\( \\mathbb{R}^3 \\). The vector field \\( F \\) can be thought of as assigning a density to each point in the region \\( A \\).\n\nThe expected value \\( E(X) \\) in this context is analogous to finding the \"average\" value of the density over the region \\( A \\). To compute this, we need to integrate the density function \\( F(x, y, z) \\) over the entire region \\( A \\). This is done using a triple integral:\n\n\\[\nE(X) = \\int \\int \\int_A F(x, y, z) \\, dV\n\\]\n\nHere, \\( dV \\) represents a small volume element in the region \\( A \\), and the triple integral sums up the contributions of the density function \\( F \\) over the entire region.\n\nIn summary, the expected value \\( E(X) \\) is equivalent to the triple integral of the density function \\( F \\) over the region \\( A \\) because the process of integration over a density function in a continuous setting captures the idea of averaging the values of the random variable, weighted by their probabilities, across the entire space where the random variable is defined. This aligns with the fundamental concept of expectation as a weighted average, extended to three dimensions.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.measureSpace', and it does not have executable code\napplication type mismatch\n  F x\nargument\n  x\nhas type\n  \u211d \u00d7 \u211d \u00d7 \u211d : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u211d : Type\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'MeasureTheory.integral', and it does not have executable code\napplication type mismatch\n  F x.cauchy\nargument\n  x.cauchy\nhas type\n  CauSeq.Completion.Cauchy abs : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u211d : Type\ninvalid projection, structure has only 1 field(s)\n  x\nhas type\n  \u211d\ninvalid projection, structure has only 1 field(s)\n  x\nhas type\n  \u211d\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

Initially, the books are priced at some original price, which we'll call \\( P \\).\n\n1. **First Step - Price Increase:**\n   John increases the price of the books by 20%. To find the new price after this increase, we calculate 20% of the original price \\( P \\) and add it to \\( P \\). Mathematically, this is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Increased Price} = P + 0.2P = 1.2P\n   \\]\n   So, the price of the books after the increase is 1.2 times the original price.\n\n2. **Second Step - Price Decrease:**\n   After the sale, John decreases the price by 20% to try to return it to the original price. However, this 20% decrease is applied to the increased price, not the original price. So, we need to calculate 20% of the increased price \\( 1.2P \\) and subtract it from \\( 1.2P \\):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Final Price} = 1.2P - 0.2 \\times 1.2P = 1.2P - 0.24P = 0.96P\n   \\]\n   The final price is 0.96 times the original price.\n\n3. **Understanding the Difference:**\n   Now, we need to find the percentage difference between the increased price and the final price. The increased price was \\( 1.2P \\) and the final price is \\( 0.96P \\). The difference between these two prices is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Difference} = 1.2P - 0.96P = 0.24P\n   \\]\n   To find the percentage difference relative to the increased price, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Percentage Difference} = \\left(\\frac{0.24P}{1.2P}\\right) \\times 100\\%\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this expression:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Percentage Difference} = \\left(\\frac{0.24}{1.2}\\right) \\times 100\\% = 0.2 \\times 100\\% = 20\\%\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the percentage of the difference between the increased price and the final price is 20%. This shows that even though the price was increased and then decreased by the same percentage, the final price is not the same as the original price due to the way percentages work on different bases.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

If \\(\\mathbf{v} = (v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_n)\\) and \\(\\mathbf{w} = (w_1, w_2, \\ldots, w_n)\\), then their sum \\(\\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{w}\\) is \\((v_1 + w_1, v_2 + w_2, \\ldots, v_n + w_n)\\).\n\n2. **Scalar Multiplication of a Vector**: When we multiply a vector by a scalar \\(c\\), each component of the vector is multiplied by \\(c\\). So, \\(c\\mathbf{v} = (cv_1, cv_2, \\ldots, cv_n)\\) and \\(c\\mathbf{w} = (cw_1, cw_2, \\ldots, cw_n)\\).\n\n3. **Applying Scalar Multiplication to the Sum**: Now, consider the left-hand side of our equation, \\(c(\\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{w})\\). This means we first add the vectors \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) to get \\((v_1 + w_1, v_2 + w_2, \\ldots, v_n + w_n)\\), and then multiply each component of this resulting vector by \\(c\\). This gives us \\((c(v_1 + w_1), c(v_2 + w_2), \\ldots, c(v_n + w_n))\\).\n\n4. **Distributing the Scalar**: By the distributive property of real numbers, we know that \\(c(v_i + w_i) = cv_i + cw_i\\) for each component \\(i\\). Therefore, the vector \\((c(v_1 + w_1), c(v_2 + w_2), \\ldots, c(v_n + w_n))\\) can be rewritten as \\((cv_1 + cw_1, cv_2 + cw_2, \\ldots, cv_n + cw_n)\\).\n\n5. **Reconstructing the Right-Hand Side**: Notice that the vector \\((cv_1 + cw_1, cv_2 + cw_2, \\ldots, cv_n + cw_n)\\) is exactly the same as the vector obtained by adding \\(c\\mathbf{v}\\) and \\(c\\mathbf{w}\\), which is \\((cv_1, cv_2, \\ldots, cv_n) + (cw_1, cw_2, \\ldots, cw_n)\\).\n\nThus, we have shown that \\(c(\\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{w}) = c\\mathbf{v} + c\\mathbf{w}\\), demonstrating that scalar multiplication distributes over vector addition.

For a function \\( f: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}^2 \\), the derivative at a point \\( x \\) is represented by a 2x2 matrix, which we denote as \\( Df(x) \\).\n\nThe function \\( f(x) = Ax \\) is a linear transformation itself, where \\( A \\) is a constant matrix. This means that for any vectors \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) in \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\), and any scalar \\( c \\), the function satisfies the properties of linearity:\n1. \\( f(x + y) = A(x + y) = Ax + Ay = f(x) + f(y) \\)\n2. \\( f(cx) = A(cx) = c(Ax) = cf(x) \\)\n\nBecause \\( f \\) is linear, the best linear approximation to \\( f \\) at any point \\( x \\) is \\( f \\) itself. In other words, the function does not change its behavior around any point because it is already linear everywhere.

The numbers from 1 to 100 form a simple arithmetic sequence where each number increases by 1. The formula for the sum of the first \\( n \\) natural numbers is:\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}\n\\]\n\nIn this case, \\( n = 100 \\). Plugging this into the formula gives:\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{100 \\times 101}{2}\n\\]\n\nLet's break this down:\n\n1. **Calculate the product**: First, multiply 100 by 101. This gives us 10,100.\n\n2. **Divide by 2**: Next, divide 10,100 by 2. This results in 5,050.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all numbers from 1 to 100 is 5,050.\n\nThis formula works because it effectively pairs numbers from opposite ends of the sequence. For example, 1 pairs with 100, 2 pairs with 99, and so on, each pair summing to 101. Since there are 100 numbers, there are 50 such pairs, each contributing 101 to the total sum. Thus, the total sum is \\( 50 \\times 101 = 5,050 \\). This reasoning confirms that the sum of numbers from 1 to 100 is indeed 5,050.",

It is a vector in three-dimensional space where the first component is \\( \\cos(t) \\), the second component is \\( \\sin(t) \\), and the third component is simply \\( t \\). This means that as \\( t \\) changes, the vector traces out a path in 3D space.\n\nTo find the derivative of \\( r(t) \\), we need to differentiate each component of the vector with respect to \\( t \\). This is a straightforward application of the rules of differentiation:\n\n1. **Differentiate the first component**: The derivative of \\( \\cos(t) \\) with respect to \\( t \\) is \\(-\\sin(t)\\). This is because the derivative of cosine is negative sine.\n\n2. **Differentiate the second component**: The derivative of \\( \\sin(t) \\) with respect to \\( t \\) is \\(\\cos(t)\\). This follows from the basic derivative rule that the derivative of sine is cosine.\n\n3. **Differentiate the third component**: The derivative of \\( t \\) with respect to \\( t \\) is \\(1\\). This is because the derivative of a linear function \\( t \\) is simply the coefficient of \\( t \\), which is 1.\n\nPutting these derivatives together, the derivative of the vector-valued function \\( r(t) \\) is:\n\\[ r'(t) = \\langle -\\sin(t), \\cos(t), 1 \\rangle \\]\n\nNow, we need to evaluate this derivative at \\( t = \\pi/4 \\). We substitute \\( t = \\pi/4 \\) into each component of the derivative:\n\n- For the first component, \\(-\\sin(\\pi/4)\\), we know that \\(\\sin(\\pi/4) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\). Therefore, \\(-\\sin(\\pi/4) = -\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\).\n\n- For the second component, \\(\\cos(\\pi/4)\\), we know that \\(\\cos(\\pi/4) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\).\n\n- The third component is simply \\(1\\), which remains unchanged regardless of \\( t \\).\n\nThus, the derivative of \\( r(t) \\) evaluated at \\( t = \\pi/4 \\) is:\n\\[ r'(\\pi/4) = \\langle -\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}, \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}, 1 \\rangle \\]\n\nThis vector represents the rate of change of the position vector \\( r(t) \\) at the specific point where \\( t = \\pi/4 \\). It tells us how the position is changing in each of the three dimensions at that instant.\nPrevious attempt failed with: compiler IR check failed at 'r', error: unknown declaration 'Real.cos'\ncompiler IR check failed at 'r'', error: unknown declaration 'Real.sin'\nambiguous, possible interpretations \n  \u03c0 : \u2115 \u2192 \u2115\n  \n  \u03c0 : \u211d\nambiguous, possible interpretations \n  \u03c0 : \u2115 \u2192 \u2115\n  \n  \u03c0 : \u211d\nambiguous, possible interpretations \n  \u03c0 : \u2115 \u2192 \u2115\n  \n  \u03c0 : \u211d\nno goals to be solved\nPlease revise the proof.",

The exponential function \\( e^{ix} \\) can be expressed using Euler's formula as \\( \\cos(x) + i\\sin(x) \\), which is continuous for all real \\( x \\). Since \\( z \\) is a constant, \\( f(x) \\) is also continuous on the interval \\([a, b]\\).\n\nThe integral of a complex function can be handled similarly to real functions, by integrating the real and imaginary parts separately. However, in this case, we can directly integrate the function using the properties of the exponential function.\n\nThe key to solving this problem is recognizing that the derivative of \\( e^{ix} \\) with respect to \\( x \\) is \\( i \\cdot e^{ix} \\). This means that \\( e^{ix} \\) is an antiderivative of \\( \\frac{1}{i} \\cdot e^{ix} \\).

Since we are evaluating a definite integral from \\( a \\) to \\( b \\), the constant \\( C \\) will cancel out, and we can write:\n\n\\[\n\\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx = z \\cdot \\left[ \\frac{1}{i} \\cdot e^{ix} \\right]_a^b = z \\cdot \\left( \\frac{1}{i} \\cdot e^{ib} - \\frac{1}{i} \\cdot e^{ia} \\right)\n\\]\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx = \\frac{z}{i} \\cdot (e^{ib} - e^{ia})\n\\]\n\nThis result shows that the integral of the function \\( f(x) = z \\cdot e^{ix} \\) over the interval \\([a, b]\\) is indeed \\( \\frac{z}{i} \\cdot (e^{ib} - e^{ia}) \\), as required. The continuity of \\( f(x) \\) ensures that the integral is well-defined, and the use of the antiderivative of \\( e^{ix} \\) allows us to compute the integral directly.\nPrevious attempt failed with: compiler IR check failed at 'f', error: unknown declaration 'Complex.exp'\ntactic 'apply' failed, failed to unify\n  HasDerivAt (fun y => ?c * ?d y) (?c * ?d') ?x\nwith\n  HasDerivAt (fun x => x * Complex.I) Complex.I \u2191x\na b : \u211d\nhab : a < b\nz : \u2102\nx : \u211d\n\u22a2 HasDerivAt (fun x => x * Complex.I) Complex.I \u2191x\ntactic 'apply' failed, failed to unify\n  HasDerivAt (fun x => rexp (?f x)) (rexp (?f ?x) * ?f') ?x\nwith\n  HasDerivAt Complex.exp (\u2191x * Complex.I).exp (\u2191x * Complex.I)\na b : \u211d\nhab : a < b\nz : \u2102\nx : \u211d\nh1 : HasDerivAt (fun x => x * Complex.I) Complex.I \u2191x\n\u22a2 HasDerivAt Complex.exp (\u2191x * Complex.I).exp (\u2191x * Complex.I)\napplication type mismatch\n  HasDerivAt.comp x ?m.2489 h1\nargument\n  h1\nhas type\n  HasDerivAt (fun x => x * Complex.I) Complex.I \u2191x : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  HasDerivAt ?m.2314 ?m.2316 x : Prop\napplication type mismatch\n  intervalIntegral.integral_eq_sub_of_hasDerivAt h\nargument\n  h\nhas type\n  \u2200 (x : \u211d), HasDerivAt (fun x => z * (x * Complex.I).exp) (z * Complex.I * (\u2191x * Complex.I).exp) \u2191x : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u2200 x \u2208 Set.uIcc ?m.2683 ?m.2684, HasDerivAt ?m.2681 (?m.2682 x) x : Prop\nunknown constant 'Complex.exp_ofReal_mul'\nunknown constant 'Complex.exp_ofReal_ofNat'\nunknown constant 'Complex.exp_ofReal_ofInt'\nunknown constant 'Complex.exp_ofReal_ofFloat'\nunknown constant 'Complex.exp_ofReal_ofRat'\nunknown constant 'Complex.exp_ofReal_ofNat_ofNat'\nunknown constant 'Complex.exp_ofReal_ofNat_ofInt'\nunknown constant 'Complex.exp_ofReal_ofNat_ofFloat'\nunknown constant 'Complex.exp_ofReal_ofNat_ofRat'\nunknown constant 'Complex.exp_ofReal_ofInt_ofNat'\nunknown constant 'Complex.exp_ofReal_ofInt_ofInt'\nunknown constant 'Complex.exp_ofReal_ofInt_ofFloat'\nunknown constant 'Complex.exp_ofReal_ofInt_ofRat'\nunknown constant 'Complex.exp_ofReal_ofFloat_ofNat'\nunknown constant 'Complex.exp_ofReal_ofFloat_ofInt'\nunknown constant 'Complex.exp_ofReal_ofFloat_ofFloat'\nunknown constant 'Complex.exp_ofReal_ofFloat_ofRat'\nunknown constant 'Complex.exp_ofReal_ofRat_ofNat'\nunknown constant 'Complex.exp_ofReal_ofRat_ofInt'\nunknown constant 'Complex.exp_ofReal_ofRat_ofFloat'\nunknown constant 'Complex.exp_ofReal_ofRat_ofRat'\nunsolved goals\na b : \u211d\nhab : a < b\nz : \u2102\nh : \u2200 (x : \u211d), HasDerivAt (fun x => z * (x * Complex.I).exp) (z * Complex.I * (\u2191x * Complex.I).exp) \u2191x\n\u22a2 ?m.2681 b - ?m.2681 a =\n    -(z * Complex.I * (\u2191b).cos) + (z * Complex.I * (\u2191a).cos - z * Complex.I ^ 2 * (\u2191b).sin) +\n      z * Complex.I ^ 2 * (\u2191a).sin\n\na b : \u211d\nhab : a < b\nz : \u2102\nh : \u2200 (x : \u211d), HasDerivAt (fun x => z * (x * Complex.I).exp) (z * Complex.I * (\u2191x * Complex.I).exp) \u2191x\n\u22a2 IntervalIntegrable (fun x => f z x) MeasureTheory.volume a b\n\na b : \u211d\nhab : a < b\nz : \u2102\nh : \u2200 (x : \u211d), HasDerivAt (fun x => z * (x * Complex.I).exp) (z * Complex.I * (\u2191x * Complex.I).exp) \u2191x\n\u22a2 \u211d \u2192 \u2102\nPlease revise the proof.",

The magnitude (or modulus) of a complex number \\( z \\), denoted as \\( |z| \\), is defined as the square root of the sum of the squares of its real and imaginary parts.

        "informal_proof": "# Informal Proof:\n\nTo prove that multiplying any number by 1 always gives the original number, let's think about what multiplication by 1 means. Multiplication is essentially repeated addition. When we multiply a number by 1, we are adding that number to itself exactly once. \n\nConsider a number \\( x \\). If we multiply \\( x \\) by 1, we are essentially saying \"take one group of \\( x \\).\" Since we are only taking one group, we are not adding anything else to it. Therefore, the result is just \\( x \\) itself.\n\nLet's break it down further:\n\n1. **Understanding Multiplication by 1**: When you multiply any number by 1, you are not changing the number. This is because 1 is the multiplicative identity. The identity property of multiplication states that any number multiplied by 1 remains unchanged.\n\n2. **Example with Numbers**: Take a simple example, say \\( x = 5 \\). If you multiply 5 by 1, you are essentially saying \"I have one group of 5,\" which is just 5. So, \\( 5 \\times 1 = 5 \\).\n\n3. **Generalization**: This logic applies to any number, whether it's an integer, a fraction, or even a more abstract number like an ordinal. The operation of multiplying by 1 does not alter the value of the number because you are not adding any additional groups of that number.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Therefore, for any number \\( x \\), multiplying by 1 results in the original number, \\( x \\). This is a fundamental property of numbers and is true across all types of numbers, including real numbers, complex numbers, and ordinals.\n\nIn summary, multiplying any number by 1 gives you the original number because 1 acts as the identity element in multiplication, meaning it does not change the value of the number it multiplies.",

To find this derivative, we differentiate the area function \\( A(r) = \\pi r^2 \\) with respect to \\( r \\).\n\nUsing basic differentiation rules, the derivative of \\( \\pi r^2 \\) with respect to \\( r \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{dA}{dr} = \\frac{d}{dr}(\\pi r^2) = 2\\pi r\n\\]\n\nThis result, \\( 2\\pi r \\), is significant because it is exactly the formula for the circumference of a circle with radius \\( r \\). The circumference \\( C \\) of a circle is given by \\( C = 2\\pi r \\).\n\nThus, the rate of change of the area of the circle with respect to its radius, \\( \\frac{dA}{dr} \\), is equal to the circumference of the circle.

To do this, we need a common denominator for the fractions. The denominators here are 4 and 2. The smallest number that both 4 and 2 divide into evenly is 4, so we'll use 4 as the common denominator.\n\nThe fraction 3/4 already has 4 as its denominator, so we don't need to change it. However, we need to convert 1/2 to have a denominator of 4. We do this by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator of 1/2 by 2, which gives us 2/4.\n\nNow, we can subtract the fractions: \n\n3/4 - 2/4 = (3 - 2)/4 = 1/4.\n\nSo, after subtracting 1/2 from 3/4, we are left with 1/4.\n\nNext, we add 1/2 back to 1/4. Again, we need a common denominator. As before, the common denominator is 4. We already have 1/4, and we need to convert 1/2 to 2/4, just like we did earlier.\n\nNow, we add the fractions:\n\n1/4 + 2/4 = (1 + 2)/4 = 3/4.\n\nAfter adding 1/2 back to 1/4, we end up with 3/4, which is the original fraction we started with.\n\nThis process shows that subtracting 1/2 and then adding 1/2 effectively cancels out the subtraction, leaving us with the original fraction.

This property states that the sum of the interior angles of any triangle is always 180 degrees. This is a well-known result in geometry and is applicable to all types of triangles, whether they are right-angled, obtuse, or acute.\n\nIn the problem, Alice has a triangle with two known angles: 50 degrees and 70 degrees. Let's denote the third angle as \\( x \\). According to the property mentioned above, the sum of the angles in the triangle should be:\n\n\\[ 50^\\circ + 70^\\circ + x = 180^\\circ. \\]\n\nNow, we can solve for \\( x \\) by subtracting the sum of the known angles from 180 degrees:\n\n1. First, add the two known angles: \\( 50^\\circ + 70^\\circ = 120^\\circ \\).\n2. Next, subtract this sum from 180 degrees to find the third angle: \\( 180^\\circ - 120^\\circ = 60^\\circ \\).\n\nTherefore, the measurement of the third angle is 60 degrees.

The key is to understand how the derivative of the function \\(f\\) relates to the slope of the tangent line at any point on the curve.\n\nFirst, let's recall that the derivative of a function at a point gives us the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the function at that point. In this case, we are given that the derivative of \\(f\\) exists everywhere and is equal to \\(f(x)\\) itself. This means that at any point \\(x\\), the slope of the tangent line to the graph of \\(f\\) is \\(f(x)\\).\n\nNow, consider the parametric curve \\(\\gamma(t) = (t, f(t))\\). At the point \\((t, f(t))\\), the tangent line will have a slope that is determined by the derivative of \\(f\\) at \\(t\\). Since the derivative of \\(f\\) at \\(t\\) is \\(f(t)\\), the slope of the tangent line at \\((t, f(t))\\) is \\(f(t)\\).\n\nThe general form of a line with slope \\(m\\) passing through a point \\((x_0, y_0)\\) is given by the equation:\n\\[ y - y_0 = m(x - x_0) \\]\n\nIn our case, the point is \\((t, f(t))\\) and the slope \\(m\\) is \\(f(t)\\). Substituting these into the equation of the line, we get:\n\\[ y - f(t) = f(t)(x - t) \\]\n\nRearranging this equation, we find:\n\\[ y = f(t)(x - t) + f(t) \\]\n\nThis is exactly the equation we were asked to prove for the tangent line to the curve \\(\\gamma\\) at the point \\((t, f(t))\\).\n\nThus, the tangent line to the curve \\(\\gamma(t) = (t, f(t))\\) at the point \\((t, f(t))\\) is indeed given by the equation:\n\\[ y = f(t) \\cdot (x - t) + f(t) \\]\n\nThis completes the informal proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: invalid declaration name '\u03b3', there is a section variable with the same name\ninvalid argument, variable is not a proposition or let-declaration\nsimp made no progress\nPlease revise the proof.",

In other words, \\((p \\implies q)\\) is equivalent to \\((\\neg q \\implies \\neg p)\\).\n\nTo understand why this is true, let's break it down into two parts: proving the forward implication and the reverse implication.\n\n### Forward Implication: \\((p \\implies q) \\implies (\\neg q \\implies \\neg p)\\)\n\n1. **Assume \\( p \\implies q \\):** We start by assuming that if \\( p \\) is true, then \\( q \\) must also be true.\n2. **Assume \\(\\neg q\\):** Next, we assume that \\( q \\) is false.\n3. **Apply Modus Tollens:** Given that \\( q \\) is false, and knowing that \\( p \\implies q \\), we can use a logical rule called Modus Tollens.

Two events \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are independent if the occurrence of one does not affect the probability of the occurrence of the other. Mathematically, this is expressed as \\(\\Pr(A \\cap B) = \\Pr(A) \\Pr(B)\\).\n\nNow, let's consider the formula for the probability of the union of two events. The general formula for the probability of the union of two events \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\Pr(A \\cup B) = \\Pr(A) + \\Pr(B) - \\Pr(A \\cap B)\n\\]\n\nThis formula accounts for the fact that when we add \\(\\Pr(A)\\) and \\(\\Pr(B)\\), we are double-counting the probability of the intersection \\( A \\cap B \\), so we subtract it once to correct this.\n\nSince \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are independent, we can substitute \\(\\Pr(A \\cap B)\\) with \\(\\Pr(A) \\Pr(B)\\) in the formula. This gives us:\n\n\\[\n\\Pr(A \\cup B) = \\Pr(A) + \\Pr(B) - \\Pr(A) \\Pr(B)\n\\]\n\nThis equation shows that the probability of either event \\( A \\) or event \\( B \\) occurring is equal to the sum of their individual probabilities minus the probability that both occur simultaneously, which is the product of their probabilities due to their independence.\n\nThus, we have shown that for independent events \\( A \\) and \\( B\\), the probability of their union is indeed \\(\\Pr(A \\cup B) = \\Pr(A) + \\Pr(B) - \\Pr(A) \\Pr(B)\\).

This means that the midpoint is equidistant from both endpoints \\( A \\) and \\( B \\).\n\nTo find the coordinates of this midpoint, we can use the idea of averaging the coordinates of the endpoints. This is because the midpoint is essentially the \"average\" position between the two points.\n\n1. **X-coordinate of the Midpoint:**\n   - The x-coordinate of the midpoint is the average of the x-coordinates of \\( A \\) and \\( B \\).

Suppose the shorter side of the rectangle is \\( x \\) units long. According to the problem, the longer side is 3 times the shorter side, so it is \\( 3x \\) units long.\n\nThe perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding up the lengths of all four sides.

This rule is often expressed in logical terms as: from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), we can deduce \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\).\n\nTo understand why this is true, let's break it down:\n\n1. **Understanding the Implication \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\):** \n   - The statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) means that whenever \\( P \\) is true, \\( Q \\) must also be true. If \\( P \\) happens, then \\( Q \\) cannot fail to happen.\n\n2. **Considering the Contrapositive \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\):**\n   - The contrapositive of an implication is a logically equivalent statement. For \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), the contrapositive is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\).\n   - This means that if \\( Q \\) is not true, then \\( P \\) cannot be true either. In other words, the failure of \\( Q \\) implies the failure of \\( P \\).\n\n3. **Why the Contrapositive Holds:**\n   - Suppose \\( \\neg Q \\) is true, meaning \\( Q \\) is false. If \\( P \\) were true, then \\( Q \\) would have to be true (because \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)), which contradicts our assumption that \\( Q \\) is false. Therefore, \\( P \\) must also be false, making \\( \\neg P \\) true.\n   - This reasoning shows that whenever \\( \\neg Q \\) is true, \\( \\neg P \\) must also be true, which is exactly what \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) states.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The contrapositive \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) is logically equivalent to the original implication \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\). This equivalence is a fundamental property of logical implications and is what the Rule of Transposition is based on.\n\nThus, the Rule of Transposition is valid because the contrapositive of any true implication is also true.

A polynomial of degree 4, like \\( f(x) \\), can have up to 4 real roots. However, it is also possible for it to have fewer real roots or even none at all, depending on its specific coefficients and structure.\n\nFirst, let's consider the end behavior of the polynomial. Since the leading term is \\( 2x^4 \\), which is positive, as \\( x \\) approaches positive or negative infinity, \\( f(x) \\) will tend to positive infinity. This suggests that the graph of the polynomial will rise on both ends.\n\nNext, we can attempt to find any obvious real roots by testing some simple values of \\( x \\). For instance, substituting \\( x = 0 \\) into the polynomial gives:\n\n\\[ f(0) = 2(0)^4 - 3(0)^3 - 11(0)^2 + 6(0) + 30 = 30. \\]\n\nThis shows that \\( f(0) \\neq 0 \\), so \\( x = 0 \\) is not a root. We can try other simple values like \\( x = 1 \\) and \\( x = -1 \\):\n\n\\[ f(1) = 2(1)^4 - 3(1)^3 - 11(1)^2 + 6(1) + 30 = 2 - 3 - 11 + 6 + 30 = 24, \\]\n\\[ f(-1) = 2(-1)^4 - 3(-1)^3 - 11(-1)^2 + 6(-1) + 30 = 2 + 3 - 11 - 6 + 30 = 18. \\]\n\nNeither \\( x = 1 \\) nor \\( x = -1 \\) are roots of the polynomial.\n\nTo further investigate, we can consider the possibility of complex roots. A polynomial with real coefficients will have complex roots in conjugate pairs. If \\( f(x) \\) has no real roots, it must have complex roots. \n\nAnother method is to use calculus to find critical points and analyze the behavior of the polynomial between these points. By finding the derivative \\( f'(x) \\) and setting it to zero, we can locate the critical points where the slope of the tangent to the graph is zero. However, even without explicit calculation, the fact that the polynomial does not change sign between these critical points can suggest the absence of real roots.\n\nFinally, we can use the Descartes' Rule of Signs to predict the number of positive and negative real roots. For \\( f(x) \\), the sign changes in the sequence of coefficients are: \\( +, -, -, +, + \\). There are two sign changes, suggesting up to two positive real roots. For \\( f(-x) \\), the sequence is: \\( +, +, -, -, + \\), which also has two sign changes, suggesting up to two negative real roots. However, these are only possibilities, not certainties.\n\nGiven the polynomial's behavior and the lack of any obvious real roots from simple substitutions, along with the end behavior analysis, it is reasonable to conclude that \\( f(x) \\) does not intersect the x-axis and thus has no real roots. This conclusion is consistent with the possibility that all roots are complex, which is a common scenario for polynomials of even degree with certain coefficient structures.\nPrevious attempt failed with: \nPlease revise the proof.",

According to the Primitive of Power theorem, the antiderivative of \\( x^n \\) is given by \\(\\frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} + C\\), where \\( C \\) is a constant. For our function \\( x^2 \\), we have \\( n = 2 \\).

We are given that the population has a mean \\( \\mu \\) and standard deviation \\( \\sigma \\), and we draw a random sample of size \\( n \\) from this population. The sample mean \\( \\bar{X} \\) is defined as:\n\n\\[\n\\bar{X} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i\n\\]\n\nwhere each \\( X_i \\) is an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variable from the population.\n\nThe key point here is that the sample mean \\( \\bar{X} \\) is itself a random variable. According to the Central Limit Theorem, for a sufficiently large sample size \\( n \\), the distribution of \\( \\bar{X} \\) approaches a normal distribution with mean \\( \\mu \\) and standard deviation \\( \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} \\). This is because the sample mean is an average of the random sample, and the Central Limit Theorem tells us that averages of i.i.d. random variables tend to be normally distributed, regardless of the original distribution of the population.\n\nNow, let's consider the probability density function of \\( \\bar{X} \\). Since \\( \\bar{X} \\) is normally distributed with mean \\( \\mu \\), the pdf of \\( \\bar{X} \\) is given by the normal distribution formula:\n\n\\[\nf(\\bar{X}) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi} \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(\\bar{X} - \\mu)^2}{2 \\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\\right)^2}\\right)\n\\]\n\nWe are asked to prove that the derivative of this pdf with respect to \\( \\bar{X} \\) is zero when \\( \\bar{X} = \\mu \\). This essentially means that the slope of the pdf is flat at the point where \\( \\bar{X} = \\mu \\), which is the peak of the normal distribution.\n\nTo find the derivative, we differentiate the pdf with respect to \\( \\bar{X} \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{d\\bar{X}} f(\\bar{X}) = \\frac{d}{d\\bar{X}} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi} \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(\\bar{X} - \\mu)^2}{2 \\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\\right)^2}\\right) \\right)\n\\]\n\nUsing the chain rule, the derivative of the exponential part is:\n\n\\[\n-\\frac{1}{\\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\\right)^2} (\\bar{X} - \\mu) \\cdot \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(\\bar{X} - \\mu)^2}{2 \\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\\right)^2}\\right)\n\\]\n\nAt \\( \\bar{X} = \\mu \\), the term \\( (\\bar{X} - \\mu) \\) becomes zero. Therefore, the entire derivative becomes zero:\n\n\\[\n-\\frac{1}{\\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\\right)^2} (0) \\cdot \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(0)^2}{2 \\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\\right)^2}\\right) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis shows that the slope of the pdf is indeed zero at \\( \\bar{X} = \\mu \\), confirming that the peak of the normal distribution is at the population mean \\( \\mu \\).

This is a classic example of a combination problem in combinatorics, where we are selecting a subset of items from a larger set without regard to the order of selection.\n\nFirst, let's identify the total number of players available for selection. Originally, there are 15 players on the team. However, since one player is injured and cannot participate, we effectively have 14 players to choose from.\n\nThe task is to select 11 players from these 14 available players. The number of ways to choose 11 players from 14 is given by the combination formula:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{14}{11} = \\frac{14!}{11!(14-11)!} = \\frac{14!}{11! \\cdot 3!}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this, we have:\n\n- \\(14! = 14 \\times 13 \\times 12 \\times 11!\\)\n- \\(3! = 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 6\\)\n\nSubstituting these into the formula, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{14}{11} = \\frac{14 \\times 13 \\times 12 \\times 11!}{11! \\times 6} = \\frac{14 \\times 13 \\times 12}{6}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the numerator:\n\n- \\(14 \\times 13 = 182\\)\n- \\(182 \\times 12 = 2184\\)\n\nNow divide by 6:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2184}{6} = 364\n\\]\n\nThus, there are 364 different ways to choose 11 players from the 14 available players.\n\nNext, we consider the second part of the problem, which involves the rate of change of the number of different teams the coach can choose. The game lasts 90 minutes, and the coach changes the players every 10 minutes. This means there are \\( \\frac{90}{10} = 9 \\) intervals during which the coach can change the team.\n\nThe rate of change of the number of different teams is 0 when the number of ways to choose the team does not change. Since the number of ways to choose the team is fixed at 364 for each interval, the rate of change is 0 throughout the game. Therefore, the rate of change is 0 at all times during the game, which is 9 times (once for each interval).\n\nIn conclusion, the coach can choose the team in 364 different ways, and the rate of change of the number of different teams is 0 throughout the game, occurring 9 times.",

The curve represents the function values \\( f(x) \\) for each \\( x \\) in the interval \\([a, b]\\). The area we are interested in is bounded by this curve, the vertical lines \\( x = a \\) and \\( x = b \\), and the \\( x \\)-axis.\n\nTo approximate this area, we can use a method called Riemann sums. Imagine dividing the interval \\([a, b]\\) into a large number of small subintervals. Each subinterval has a width \\(\\delta x\\), which is a small positive number. For each subinterval, we can draw a rectangle whose height is determined by the value of the function at some point within the subinterval. A common choice is to use the left endpoint, right endpoint, or the midpoint of each subinterval to determine the height.\n\nThe area of each rectangle is approximately \\( f(x_i) \\cdot \\delta x \\), where \\( x_i \\) is a point in the \\( i \\)-th subinterval. By summing up the areas of all these rectangles, we get an approximation of the total area under the curve. This sum is called a Riemann sum.\n\nAs we make the subintervals narrower (i.e., as \\(\\delta x\\) approaches zero), the Riemann sum becomes a better approximation of the actual area. In the limit, as the number of subintervals goes to infinity and \\(\\delta x\\) goes to zero, the Riemann sum converges to the definite integral \\(\\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx\\).\n\nThe reason this works is due to the properties of continuous functions. A continuous function on a closed interval \\([a, b]\\) is guaranteed to be integrable, meaning that the limit of the Riemann sums exists and is equal to the definite integral. This integral represents the exact area under the curve because it accounts for all the infinitesimally small contributions of the function values over the interval.\n\nThus, the area \\( A \\) under the curve of a continuous function \\( f \\) from \\( a \\) to \\( b \\) is precisely given by the definite integral \\(\\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx\\). This integral captures the accumulation of the function's values over the interval, providing a precise measure of the area between the curve and the \\( x \\)-axis.\nPrevious attempt failed with: function expected at\n  Icc\nterm has type\n  ?m.386\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "# Informal Proof:\n\nTo find the area of a rectangle, we use the formula that states the area is equal to the product of its length and width. This formula is derived from the basic understanding of how area is measured in a two-dimensional space, specifically for rectangles.\n\nIn this problem, we are given a rectangle with a length of 8 units and a width of 5 units. According to the formula for the area of a rectangle, we multiply these two dimensions together to find the area.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. **Understanding the Formula**: The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying the length by the width. This is because a rectangle is essentially a grid of unit squares, and the number of squares that fit inside the rectangle is determined by how many fit along the length and how many fit along the width.\n\n2. **Applying the Given Dimensions**: We have a length of 8 units and a width of 5 units. By multiplying these two numbers, we are essentially counting how many unit squares fit along the length (8) and how many rows of these unit squares fit along the width (5).\n\n3. **Calculation**: Multiply the length (8 units) by the width (5 units):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = 8 \\times 5 = 40 \\text{ square units}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the area of the rectangle is 40 square units. This result aligns with the theorem that the area of a rectangle is the product of its base (length) and height (width), as discussed in the context provided.\n\nBy following these steps, we have used the fundamental properties of rectangles and the definition of area to determine that the area of the given rectangle is 40 square units.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

We know that after giving away apples to his 5 friends, John is left with 7 apples.\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Situation**: John gives away 2 apples to each of his 5 friends. This means he gives away a total of \\(2 \\times 5 = 10\\) apples.\n\n2. **Current Situation**: After giving away these 10 apples, John is left with 7 apples. This means that just before he started giving away apples, he must have had enough apples to cover both the 10 he gave away and the 7 he has left.\n\n3. **Calculating the Original Number of Apples**: To find out how many apples John originally had, we simply add the number of apples he gave away to the number he has left.

The variance of a random variable \\( X \\), denoted as \\( \\text{Var}(X) \\), is a measure of how much the values of \\( X \\) deviate from the mean \\( \\mu = E(X) \\). The variance is defined as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Var}(X) = E((X - \\mu)^2)\n\\]\n\nThis definition directly tells us that the variance is the expected value of the squared deviations of \\( X \\) from its mean \\( \\mu \\).\n\nNow, according to the problem, we are given that \\( \\text{Var}(X) = \\sigma^2 \\). This means that the variance of \\( X \\) is already known to be \\( \\sigma^2 \\). Therefore, by the definition of variance, we have:\n\n\\[\nE((X - \\mu)^2) = \\sigma^2\n\\]\n\nThis equation is exactly what we need to prove. It states that the expected value of the squared deviations of \\( X \\) from its mean \\( \\mu \\) is equal to the variance \\( \\sigma^2 \\).\n\nThe problem also mentions a real number \\( t \\), but it does not affect the proof because the expression \\( E((X - \\mu)^2) \\) is independent of \\( t \\). The expectation of the squared deviations from the mean is a property of the random variable \\( X \\) itself and does not change with different values of \\( t \\).\n\nIn summary, the statement \\( E((X - \\mu)^2) = \\sigma^2 \\) is a direct consequence of the definition of variance. Since we are given that \\( \\text{Var}(X) = \\sigma^2 \\), it follows immediately that the expected value of the squared deviations from the mean is \\( \\sigma^2 \\).

Specifically, we have:\n\n\\[ \\frac{AB}{DE} = \\frac{BC}{EF} = \\frac{AC}{DF} = k \\]\n\nwhere \\(k\\) is the constant ratio of the corresponding sides.\n\nNow, let's focus on the areas of these triangles. The area of a triangle can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} \\]\n\nFor \\(\\triangle ABC\\), let's say \\(BC\\) is the base, and \\(h_1\\) is the corresponding height from vertex \\(A\\) perpendicular to \\(BC\\). Thus, the area \\(S_1\\) of \\(\\triangle ABC\\) is:\n\n\\[ S_1 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times BC \\times h_1 \\]\n\nSimilarly, for \\(\\triangle DEF\\), if \\(EF\\) is the base and \\(h_2\\) is the corresponding height from vertex \\(D\\) perpendicular to \\(EF\\), the area \\(S_2\\) of \\(\\triangle DEF\\) is:\n\n\\[ S_2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times EF \\times h_2 \\]\n\nSince the triangles are similar, not only are the sides proportional, but the heights are also proportional to the corresponding sides. Therefore, we have:\n\n\\[ \\frac{h_1}{h_2} = \\frac{BC}{EF} = k \\]\n\nNow, substituting the expressions for the areas, we get:\n\n\\[ S_1 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times BC \\times h_1 \\]\n\\[ S_2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times EF \\times h_2 \\]\n\nThe ratio of the areas is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{S_1}{S_2} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} \\times BC \\times h_1}{\\frac{1}{2} \\times EF \\times h_2} = \\frac{BC \\times h_1}{EF \\times h_2} \\]\n\nSubstituting the proportional relationships, we have:\n\n\\[ \\frac{S_1}{S_2} = \\frac{(k \\times EF) \\times (k \\times h_2)}{EF \\times h_2} = \\frac{k^2 \\times EF \\times h_2}{EF \\times h_2} = k^2 \\]\n\nThus, the ratio of the areas of the similar triangles \\(\\triangle ABC\\) and \\(\\triangle DEF\\) is indeed the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides, which is \\(k^2\\).

It is the integral of the dot product of the vector field \\( F \\) with the differential element of the curve \\( d\\mathbf{r} \\). The curve \\( C \\) is parameterized by \\( \\mathbf{r}(t) \\), so \\( d\\mathbf{r} = \\mathbf{r}'(t) \\, dt \\).\n\nThe derivative of \\( \\mathbf{r}(t) \\) with respect to \\( t \\) is:\n\\[\n\\mathbf{r}'(t) = \\langle -\\sin(t), \\cos(t), 1 \\rangle\n\\]\n\nNow, let's compute the vector field \\( F \\) at any point on the curve. Since \\( F = \\langle y, -x, z \\rangle \\), substituting the parameterization of the curve, we get:\n\\[\nF(\\mathbf{r}(t)) = \\langle \\sin(t), -\\cos(t), t \\rangle\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the dot product \\( F(\\mathbf{r}(t)) \\cdot \\mathbf{r}'(t) \\):\n\\[\nF(\\mathbf{r}(t)) \\cdot \\mathbf{r}'(t) = \\langle \\sin(t), -\\cos(t), t \\rangle \\cdot \\langle -\\sin(t), \\cos(t), 1 \\rangle\n\\]\n\nThis dot product simplifies to:\n\\[\n= \\sin(t)(-\\sin(t)) + (-\\cos(t))(\\cos(t)) + t(1)\n\\]\n\\[\n= -\\sin^2(t) - \\cos^2(t) + t\n\\]\n\nUsing the Pythagorean identity, we know that \\(\\sin^2(t) + \\cos^2(t) = 1\\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:\n\\[\n= -1 + t\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to integrate this expression from \\( t = 0 \\) to \\( t = 2\\pi \\):\n\\[\n\\int_0^{2\\pi} (-1 + t) \\, dt\n\\]\n\nThis integral can be split into two separate integrals:\n\\[\n= \\int_0^{2\\pi} -1 \\, dt + \\int_0^{2\\pi} t \\, dt\n\\]\n\nThe first integral evaluates to:\n\\[\n\\int_0^{2\\pi} -1 \\, dt = -t \\bigg|_0^{2\\pi} = -(2\\pi - 0) = -2\\pi\n\\]\n\nThe second integral evaluates to:\n\\[\n\\int_0^{2\\pi} t \\, dt = \\frac{t^2}{2} \\bigg|_0^{2\\pi} = \\frac{(2\\pi)^2}{2} - \\frac{0^2}{2} = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{2} = 2\\pi^2\n\\]\n\nAdding these results together gives:\n\\[\n-2\\pi + 2\\pi^2\n\\]\n\nHowever, we notice that the problem asks us to prove that the line integral is zero. Let's reconsider the context of the problem.

The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Area of a rectangle} = \\text{length} \\times \\text{width} \\]\n\nFor each rectangle in our problem, the length is 20 units and the width is 10 units.

Since each rectangle has an area of 200 square units, removing one rectangle will reduce the total area by 200 square units.\n\nThus, the area of the remaining figure, after removing one rectangle, is:\n\n\\[ 800 - 200 = 600 \\text{ square units} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total area of the remaining figure is 600 square units.

The gradient of a differentiable function \\( f: V \\to \\mathbb{R} \\) at a point \\( a \\) in a vector space \\( V \\) is a vector that points in the direction of the greatest rate of increase of the function. It is composed of the partial derivatives of \\( f \\) with respect to each of the basis vectors of \\( V \\).\n\nNow, consider the directional derivative of \\( f \\) at the point \\( a \\) in the direction of a basis vector \\( v_i \\). The directional derivative gives us the rate of change of the function \\( f \\) as we move from \\( a \\) in the direction of \\( v_i \\). Mathematically, it is expressed as the dot product of the gradient of \\( f \\) at \\( a \\) and the vector \\( v_i \\).\n\nAccording to the problem, for each basis vector \\( v_i \\), the directional derivative of \\( f \\) at \\( a \\) in the direction of \\( v_i \\) is equal to the \\( i \\)-th component of the vector \\( w \\). This means that the rate of change of \\( f \\) in the direction of each basis vector is exactly captured by the corresponding component of \\( w \\).\n\nSince the gradient of \\( f \\) at \\( a \\) is a vector whose components are precisely these directional derivatives with respect to each basis vector, it follows that the gradient vector must be equal to the vector \\( w \\). Each component of the gradient matches the corresponding component of \\( w \\) because they both represent the same directional derivatives.\n\nTherefore, the gradient of \\( f \\) at the point \\( a \\) is indeed the vector \\( w \\), as each component of the gradient corresponds to the directional derivative in the direction of each basis vector, which matches the components of \\( w \\) by the given condition.

The task is to add the first two numbers together and then subtract the third number from this sum.\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Addition of the First Two Numbers:**\n   - We start by adding 1234 and 5678.\n   - To do this, we align the numbers by their place values and add them column by column, starting from the rightmost digit (the units place).\n   - Adding the units place: 4 + 8 = 12. We write down 2 and carry over 1 to the tens place.\n   - Adding the tens place: 3 + 7 = 10, plus the carried over 1 gives us 11. We write down 1 and carry over 1 to the hundreds place.\n   - Adding the hundreds place: 2 + 6 = 8, plus the carried over 1 gives us 9. We write down 9.\n   - Adding the thousands place: 1 + 5 = 6. We write down 6.\n   - Therefore, the sum of 1234 and 5678 is 6912.\n\n2. **Subtraction of the Third Number:**\n   - Next, we subtract the third number, 3456, from the sum we just calculated, which is 6912.\n   - Again, we align the numbers by their place values and subtract them column by column, starting from the rightmost digit.\n   - Subtracting the units place: 2 - 6. Since 2 is less than 6, we need to borrow 1 from the tens place, making it 12 - 6 = 6.\n   - Subtracting the tens place: After borrowing, we have 0 in the tens place. We need to borrow 1 from the hundreds place, making it 10 - 5 = 5.\n   - Subtracting the hundreds place: After borrowing, we have 8 in the hundreds place. So, 8 - 4 = 4.\n   - Subtracting the thousands place: 6 - 3 = 3.\n   - Therefore, the result of subtracting 3456 from 6912 is 3456.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - The result of adding 1234 and 5678, and then subtracting 3456 from the sum, is 3456.\n\nThis step-by-step process shows that the arithmetic operations are straightforward and follow the basic rules of addition and subtraction.

In the context of rational numbers, this means that if \\( a \\times b = 1 \\), then \\( b \\) is indeed the multiplicative inverse of \\( a \\).\n\nLet's break this down:\n\n1. **Definition of Multiplicative Inverse**: By definition, the multiplicative inverse of a number \\( a \\) is a number \\( b \\) such that \\( a \\times b = 1 \\). This is the key property that defines the inverse.\n\n2. **Given Condition**: We are given that \\( a \\times b = 1 \\). This directly matches the definition of the multiplicative inverse. Therefore, by definition, \\( b \\) must be the multiplicative inverse of \\( a \\).\n\n3. **Non-zero Condition**: The problem states that \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are non-zero rational numbers.

This is a fundamental property of congruence in geometry. When we say two triangles are congruent, it implies that there exists a series of transformations\u2014such as rotations, reflections, or translations\u2014that can map one triangle onto the other perfectly.\n\nIn this problem, we are given that \\( \\triangle ABC \\) is transformed into \\( \\triangle DEF \\) through such transformations. These transformations do not alter the size or shape of the triangles; they merely reposition them in space. Therefore, the corresponding sides and angles remain equal.\n\nSpecifically, the Side-Side-Side (SSS) Congruence Theorem states that if all three sides of one triangle are equal to all three sides of another triangle, then the triangles are congruent.

We can use the properties of the normal distribution to find this probability.\n\nFirst, let's understand the setup. We are dealing with a sample proportion, which can be approximated by a normal distribution when the sample size is large enough. This is due to the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the sampling distribution of the sample proportion will be approximately normal if the sample size is sufficiently large.\n\nThe mean of this normal distribution is the population proportion \\( p = 0.7 \\). The standard deviation, often called the standard error in this context, is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Standard Deviation} = \\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the values, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Standard Deviation} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.7 \\times (1 - 0.7)}{100}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.7 \\times 0.3}{100}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.21}{100}} = \\sqrt{0.0021} \\approx 0.0458\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the z-score for the sample proportion \\( x = 0.5 \\). The z-score is a measure of how many standard deviations an element is from the mean. It is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\nz = \\frac{x - \\text{mean}}{\\text{standard deviation}}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values we have:\n\n\\[\nz = \\frac{0.5 - 0.7}{0.0458} = \\frac{-0.2}{0.0458} \\approx -4.37\n\\]\n\nThe z-score of approximately -4.37 indicates that 0.5 is 4.37 standard deviations below the mean of 0.7. \n\nNow, to find the probability that the sample proportion is less than 0.5, we look up this z-score in the standard normal distribution table, or use a calculator that provides cumulative probabilities for the standard normal distribution. A z-score of -4.37 is extremely low, and the cumulative probability associated with such a z-score is very close to 0. This means that the probability of the sample proportion being less than 0.5 is almost negligible.\n\nIn conclusion, given the population proportion of 0.7 and a sample size of 100, the probability that the sample proportion is less than 0.5 is extremely small, practically zero. This is because 0.5 is significantly lower than the mean of the distribution, and the sample size is large enough to ensure a tight distribution around the mean.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\nunknown constant 'Real.erf'\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'probLessThanX', and it does not have executable code\nPlease revise the proof.",

Since \\( f \\) is continuous, the limit of \\( f(k) \\) as \\( k \\to x \\) is simply \\( f(x) \\).\n\nTherefore, the derivative of \\( F(x) \\) is \\( f(x) \\), which completes the proof. This result is a direct consequence of the continuity of \\( f \\) and the properties of definite integrals and derivatives.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.measureSpace', and it does not have executable code\nunknown identifier 'has_deriv_at_integral_of_continuous'\nPlease revise the proof.",

The integral of a function over an interval gives us the area under the curve of that function between the specified limits. In this case, we are looking for the area under the curve of \\( f(x) = 2x \\) from \\( x = 0 \\) to \\( x = 1 \\).\n\nTo find this integral, we use the concept of finding a primitive (or antiderivative) of the function. The primitive of a function \\( f(x) = 2x \\) is a function \\( F(x) \\) such that the derivative of \\( F(x) \\) is \\( f(x) \\). According to the Primitive of Power rule, the integral of \\( x^n \\) is \\(\\frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1}\\) plus a constant \\( C \\), provided \\( n \\neq -1 \\).\n\nFor our function \\( f(x) = 2x \\), we can express it as \\( 2x^1 \\). Applying the rule, the primitive of \\( x^1 \\) is \\(\\frac{x^{1+1}}{1+1} = \\frac{x^2}{2}\\). Therefore, the primitive of \\( 2x \\) is \\( 2 \\times \\frac{x^2}{2} = x^2 \\).\n\nNow, we apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, which states that if \\( F(x) \\) is an antiderivative of \\( f(x) \\), then the definite integral from \\( a \\) to \\( b \\) of \\( f(x) \\) is \\( F(b) - F(a) \\).\n\nIn our case, \\( F(x) = x^2 \\).

The slope of these lines is 2, meaning they rise 2 units for every 1 unit they run horizontally. This slope information tells us that both lines are inclined at the same angle relative to the horizontal axis, but it doesn't directly affect the distance between them, which is consistently 10 units.\n\nNow, we introduce line EF, which intersects line AB at point E and line CD at point F. The slope of line EF is given as -0.5, indicating that for every 1 unit it moves horizontally, it descends 0.5 units vertically. This negative slope suggests that line EF is slanting downwards as it moves from left to right.\n\nSince lines AB and CD are parallel and 10 units apart, and line EF crosses both, we can think of EF as forming a transversal between these two parallel lines. The key to solving this problem is to determine how far line EF travels horizontally between its intersections with AB and CD.\n\nGiven the slopes, we can use the concept of similar triangles or the relationship between slopes and distances. The slope of EF, -0.5, means that for every 1 unit of horizontal movement, there is a 0.5 unit vertical change. However, since the lines AB and CD are 10 units apart vertically, we need to find out how much horizontal distance EF covers to achieve this vertical separation.\n\nTo find this, we set up a proportion based on the slope of EF. If a vertical change of 0.5 units corresponds to a horizontal change of 1 unit, then a vertical change of 10 units (the distance between AB and CD) will correspond to a horizontal change of:\n\n\\[ \\text{Horizontal distance} = \\frac{10 \\text{ units (vertical change)}}{0.5 \\text{ (slope)}} = 20 \\text{ units} \\]\n\nTherefore, the length of line EF, which is the horizontal distance it covers between the two parallel lines, is 20 units.

The cone shares this base, meaning its base is also a circle with radius \\( r \\). The apex of the cone is directly above the center of the base, at the top of the cylinder.\n\nTo find the angle at the apex of the cone, we need to consider a vertical cross-section of the cylinder and cone.

The two equal sides of this triangle are the slant heights of the cone, and the base of the triangle is the diameter of the base of the cone, which is \\( 2r \\).\n\nThe height of this triangle is the height of the cone, which is the same as the height of the cylinder, \\( h \\).\n\nNow, let's focus on the geometry of this triangle.

With negative numbers, this means we are combining their \"negative\" values, which results in a more negative number. \n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. **Understanding Negative Numbers**: A negative number represents a value less than zero. For example, -3 means 3 units below zero on the number line.\n\n2. **Adding Negative Numbers**: When you add two negative numbers, you are moving further left on the number line. This is because each negative number represents a movement to the left from zero.\n\n3. **Example with -3 and -5**: \n   - Start at zero on the number line.\n   - Move 3 units to the left to reach -3.\n   - From -3, move another 5 units to the left. \n\n4. **Calculating the Result**: \n   - Starting at -3, moving 5 more units to the left lands you at -8. \n   - This is because you are adding the absolute values of the numbers (3 and 5) and then applying the negative sign to the result.\n\nTherefore, the result of adding -3 and -5 is -8. This is consistent with the rule that adding two negative numbers results in a more negative number, specifically the sum of their absolute values with a negative sign.\nPrevious attempt failed with: no goals to be solved\nPlease revise the proof.",

This rule is often expressed in logical terms as: from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), we can deduce \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\).\n\nTo understand why this is true, let's break it down:\n\n1. **Understanding the Implication \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\):**\n   - The statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) means that whenever P is true, Q must also be true. If P is true and Q is false, the implication is violated, which is not allowed.\n\n2. **Understanding the Contrapositive \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\):**\n   - The contrapositive of an implication is a logically equivalent statement. Here, \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) means that if Q is not true, then P cannot be true either.\n\n3. **Why are these equivalent?**\n   - Let's assume \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is true. We need to show that \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) is also true.\n   - Suppose \\( \\neg Q \\) is true, meaning Q is false. If P were true, then Q would have to be true (because \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is true), which contradicts our assumption that Q is false. Therefore, P cannot be true, so \\( \\neg P \\) must be true.\n   - This reasoning shows that whenever \\( \\neg Q \\) is true, \\( \\neg P \\) must also be true, which is exactly what \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) states.\n\n4. **Reverse Implication:**\n   - Conversely, if we assume \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) is true, we can show that \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) must also be true.\n   - Suppose P is true. If Q were false, then \\( \\neg Q \\) would be true, which would imply \\( \\neg P \\) is true (since \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) is true). But this is a contradiction because we assumed P is true. Therefore, Q must be true whenever P is true, which is exactly what \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) states.\n\nThus, the Rule of Transposition holds because the original implication and its contrapositive are logically equivalent.

Suppose \\( y_1(x) \\) and \\( y_2(x) \\) are two solutions to this equation. The Wronskian of these solutions is defined as:\n\n\\[ W(y_1, y_2) = y_1(x)y_2'(x) - y2(x)y_1'(x) \\]\n\nThe key to understanding the behavior of the Wronskian lies in its derivative. Using the product rule for derivatives, we can differentiate the Wronskian:\n\n\\[ W'(y_1, y_2) = y_1'(x)y_2'(x) + y_1(x)y_2''(x) - (y_2'(x)y_1'(x) + y_2(x)y_1''(x)) \\]\n\nSimplifying this expression, we find:\n\n\\[ W'(y_1, y_2) = y_1(x)y_2''(x) - y_2(x)y_1''(x) \\]\n\nSince both \\( y_1(x) \\) and \\( y_2(x) \\) are solutions to the differential equation, we can substitute their second derivatives from the original equation:\n\n\\[ y_1''(x) = -p(x)y_1'(x) - q(x)y_1(x) \\]\n\\[ y_2''(x) = -p(x)y_2'(x) - q(x)y_2(x) \\]\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for \\( W'(y_1, y_2) \\), we get:\n\n\\[ W'(y_1, y_2) = y_1(x)(-p(x)y_2'(x) - q(x)y_2(x)) - y_2(x)(-p(x)y_1'(x) - q(x)y_1(x)) \\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[ W'(y_1, y_2) = -p(x)(y_1(x)y_2'(x) - y_2(x)y_1'(x)) = -p(x)W(y_1, y_2) \\]\n\nThis is a first-order linear differential equation for the Wronskian:\n\n\\[ W'(x) + p(x)W(x) = 0 \\]\n\nThe solution to this type of equation is given by:\n\n\\[ W(x) = C e^{-\\int p(x) \\, dx} \\]\n\nwhere \\( C \\) is a constant. The exponential function \\( e^{-\\int p(x) \\, dx} \\) is never zero because the exponential function is always positive. Therefore, the Wronskian \\( W(x) \\) is zero if and only if the constant \\( C \\) is zero.\n\nThus, if \\( C = 0 \\), the Wronskian is zero everywhere on the interval \\( I \\). If \\( C \\neq 0 \\), the Wronskian is never zero on \\( I \\). This proves that the Wronskian is either always zero or never zero on the interval \\( I \\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.RCLike', and it does not have executable code\ntype mismatch\n  h_diff x hx\nhas type\n  HasDerivAt y1 (p x * y1 x + q x * y1 x) x : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  HasDerivAt (fun y => y1 y) (deriv y1 x) x : Prop\ntype mismatch\n  h_diff' x hx\nhas type\n  HasDerivAt y2 (p x * y2 x + q x * y2 x) x : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  HasDerivAt (fun y => y2 y) (deriv y2 x) x : Prop\ntype mismatch\n  h1\nhas type\n  HasDerivAt (fun x => y1 x * deriv y2 x) (deriv y1 x * deriv y2 x + y1 x * deriv (deriv y2) x) x : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  HasDerivAt (fun x => y1 x * deriv y2 x)\n    (deriv y1 x * deriv y2 x + y1 x * deriv (deriv y2) x - deriv y2 x * deriv y1 x) x : Prop\ntype mismatch\n  h3\nhas type\n  HasDerivAt (wronskian y1 y2)\n    (deriv y1 x * deriv y2 x + y1 x * (-(p x * deriv y2 x) - q x * y2 x) - deriv y2 x * deriv y1 x -\n      y2 x * (-(p x * deriv y1 x) - q x * y1 x))\n    x : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  W' x + p x * wronskian y1 y2 x = 0 : Prop\nunknown identifier 'C'\nunknown identifier 'C'\nunsolved goals\ncase pos.h\np q y1 y2 : \u211d \u2192 \u211d\nI : Set \u211d\nh_diff : \u2200 x \u2208 I, HasDerivAt y1 (p x * y1 x + q x * y1 x) x\nh_diff' : \u2200 x \u2208 I, HasDerivAt y2 (p x * y2 x + q x * y2 x) x\nW' : \u211d \u2192 \u211d := fun x => deriv (wronskian y1 y2) x\nhW' : \u2200 x \u2208 I, W' x + p x * wronskian y1 y2 x = 0\nhW : \u2200 x \u2208 I, wronskian y1 y2 x = sorryAx \u211d true * rexp (-\u222b (x : \u211d) in I, p x)\nhC : sorryAx \u2115 true = 0\nx : \u211d\nhx : x \u2208 I\n\u22a2 sorryAx \u211d true = 0 \u2228 rexp (-\u222b (x : \u211d) in I, p x) = 0\nPlease revise the proof.",

The reason this works is that absolute convergence ensures that the series behaves nicely enough for differentiation to be valid term by term.\n\nNow, let's differentiate the series term by term. The original series is:\n\n\\[ f(x) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n x^n. \\]\n\nWhen we differentiate each term \\( a_n x^n \\) with respect to \\( x \\), we use the power rule for differentiation, which states that the derivative of \\( x^n \\) is \\( n x^{n-1} \\). Applying this to each term, we get:\n\n\\[ \\frac{d}{dx}(a_n x^n) = n a_n x^{n-1}. \\]\n\nTherefore, the derivative of the entire series, term by term, is:\n\n\\[ f'(x) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} n a_n x^{n-1}. \\]\n\nNotice that the sum starts from \\( n=1 \\) because the derivative of the \\( n=0 \\) term, which is a constant \\( a_0 \\), is zero.\n\nThis term-by-term differentiation is valid for all \\( x \\) in the interval \\((-R, R)\\) because the series converges absolutely there. Absolute convergence ensures that the series of derivatives also converges uniformly, which is a condition that allows us to interchange the order of summation and differentiation.\n\nIn summary, the absolute convergence of the original series within the interval \\((-R, R)\\) allows us to differentiate it term by term, leading to the result that the derivative of the function \\( f(x) \\) is given by the series \\( \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} n a_n x^{n-1} \\). This completes the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

We also need to assess whether the length of AB can be less than or equal to 5.\n\nFirst, let's recall the definition of sine in a right triangle. The sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. In this triangle, angle A is opposite side BC, and the hypotenuse is side AB. Therefore, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\sin A = \\frac{\\text{opposite}}{\\text{hypotenuse}} = \\frac{BC}{AB}\n\\]\n\nGiven that \\(\\sin A = 0.5\\) and \\(BC = 10\\), we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n0.5 = \\frac{10}{AB}\n\\]\n\nTo find AB, we solve for it by multiplying both sides of the equation by AB and then dividing by 0.5:\n\n\\[\nAB \\times 0.5 = 10 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad AB = \\frac{10}{0.5} = 20\n\\]\n\nThus, the length of side AB is 20.\n\nNow, let's consider the hypothesis that the length of AB is less than or equal to 5. We have found that AB is 20, which is clearly greater than 5. Therefore, the hypothesis that AB is less than or equal to 5 is incorrect.\n\nSince the problem asks us to reject the hypothesis at a significance level of 0.05, we interpret this in the context of hypothesis testing. The significance level of 0.05 typically means that we are willing to accept a 5% chance of incorrectly rejecting a true hypothesis. However, in this case, the hypothesis is clearly false because the calculated length of AB (20) is much greater than 5. Therefore, we can confidently reject the hypothesis that AB is less than or equal to 5, well beyond the 0.05 significance level.\n\nIn conclusion, the length of side AB is 20, and we can reject the hypothesis that AB is less than or equal to 5 with high confidence.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.sin', and it does not have executable code\nambiguous, possible interpretations \n  \u03c0 : \u2115 \u2192 \u2115\n  \n  \u03c0 : \u211d\nambiguous, possible interpretations \n  _root_.sin A : \u211d\n  \n  A.sin : \u211d\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

So, we can express the length as \\( l = 2w + 3 \\).\n\nNext, we use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle.

The part relevant to our problem states that if \\( F(x) \\) is an antiderivative of \\( f(x) \\) on the interval \\([a, b]\\), then the definite integral of \\( f(x) \\) from \\( a \\) to \\( b \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx = F(b) - F(a)\n\\]\n\nHere's how we can understand this:\n\n1. **Antiderivative Definition**: By definition, an antiderivative \\( F(x) \\) of \\( f(x) \\) means that the derivative of \\( F(x) \\) is \\( f(x) \\). In other words, \\( F'(x) = f(x) \\).\n\n2. **Application of the Fundamental Theorem**: The theorem tells us that if you take the antiderivative \\( F(x) \\) and evaluate it at the endpoints of the interval \\([a, b]\\), the difference \\( F(b) - F(a) \\) gives you the net area under the curve \\( f(x) \\) from \\( a \\) to \\( b \\).\n\n3. **Given Condition**: We are given that \\( F(a) = 0 \\). This simplifies our expression for the definite integral:\n\n   \\[\n   \\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx = F(b) - F(a) = F(b) - 0 = F(b)\n   \\]\n\nThus, the definite integral from \\( a \\) to \\( b \\) of \\( f(x) \\, dx \\) is simply \\( F(b) \\), which is consistent with the statement \\( F(b) - F(a) \\) given that \\( F(a) = 0 \\).\n\nIn summary, the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus provides a powerful link between the process of differentiation and integration, allowing us to evaluate definite integrals using antiderivatives. In this case, the condition \\( F(a) = 0 \\) makes the calculation straightforward, confirming that the integral from \\( a \\) to \\( b \\) of \\( f(x) \\, dx \\) is indeed \\( F(b) - F(a) \\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'a'\nunknown identifier 'integral_eq_sub_of_hasDerivAt'\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, equality or iff proof expected\n  ?m.639\nf F : \u211d \u2192 \u211d\na b : \u211d\n\u22a2 \u222b (x : \u211d) in a..b, f x = F b - F a\nPlease revise the proof.",

Here, \\( m \\) is the slope of the line, and \\( b \\) is the y-intercept, which is the point where the line crosses the y-axis.\n\n2. **Modification of the Equation**: We are asked to replace \\( x \\) with \\( (x + 1) \\). This means wherever we see \\( x \\) in the equation, we substitute it with \\( (x + 1) \\). So, the equation becomes:\n   \\[\n   y = m(x + 1) + b\n   \\]\n\n3. **Simplifying the New Equation**: Let's expand the new equation:\n   \\[\n   y = m(x + 1) + b = mx + m \\cdot 1 + b = mx + m + b\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   y = mx + (m + b)\n   \\]\n\n4. **Comparison with the Original Equation**: The new equation \\( y = mx + (m + b) \\) has the same slope \\( m \\) as the original equation \\( y = mx + b \\). The only difference is in the y-intercept, which has changed from \\( b \\) to \\( m + b \\).\n\n5. **Understanding Parallel Lines**: In geometry, two lines are parallel if they have the same slope. The slope determines the angle at which the line inclines or declines. Since both the original and the new line have the same slope \\( m \\), they are parallel to each other. The change in the y-intercept simply means that the new line is shifted vertically up or down compared to the original line, but it does not affect the direction or steepness of the line.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: By replacing \\( x \\) with \\( (x + 1) \\), we have effectively shifted the line horizontally, which results in a vertical shift in the y-intercept. However, the slope remains unchanged, ensuring that the new line is parallel to the original line.\n\nThus, the new equation \\( y = m(x + 1) + b \\) represents a line that is parallel to the original line \\( y = mx + b \\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

In this context, it will tell us how the number of students changes as we move from one category to another.\n\nThe function \\( f(x) = 5x^2 \\) is a simple polynomial function.

For example, multiplying 5 by 10 gives you 50, and multiplying 23 by 10 gives you 230. This is because 10 is the base of our decimal system, and multiplying by 10 shifts all digits one place to the left, making room for a new zero at the end.\n\nNow, let's extend this idea to multiplying by \\(10^n\\). The expression \\(10^n\\) means 10 multiplied by itself \\(n\\) times. So, multiplying a number by \\(10^n\\) is like multiplying it by 10, \\(n\\) times in succession. Each multiplication by 10 shifts the decimal point one place to the right. Therefore, multiplying by \\(10^n\\) shifts the decimal point \\(n\\) places to the right.\n\nFor example, consider the number 3.14. If we multiply it by \\(10^1\\) (which is 10), the decimal point moves one place to the right, resulting in 31.4. If we multiply 3.14 by \\(10^2\\) (which is 100), the decimal point moves two places to the right, resulting in 314.0.\n\nThis concept holds true for any real number, not just integers or simple decimals. The key is that each multiplication by 10 shifts the decimal point one place to the right, and doing this \\(n\\) times moves it \\(n\\) places to the right.\n\nThus, multiplying a number by \\(10^n\\) is equivalent to moving the decimal point \\(n\\) places to the right, which is exactly what we set out to prove.",

In a typical linear regression model, \\( \\beta_1 \\) represents the slope, which indicates how much \\( y \\) changes for a unit change in \\( n \\).\n\nHowever, the expression \\( a_n = n^2 - 2n + 3 \\) is not linear in \\( n \\) because it includes a quadratic term \\( n^2 \\). This means that the sequence is not a simple linear regression model, but rather a quadratic one. In a quadratic expression like this, the term \\( n^2 \\) dominates the behavior of the sequence as \\( n \\) becomes large.\n\nTo understand the behavior of the sequence, let's analyze the expression:\n\n1. **Quadratic Term Dominance**: The term \\( n^2 \\) grows much faster than the linear term \\( -2n \\) and the constant term \\( 3 \\) as \\( n \\) increases. This means that for large values of \\( n \\), the sequence \\( a_n \\) will be primarily influenced by the \\( n^2 \\) term.\n\n2. **Behavior of the Sequence**: Since the leading term \\( n^2 \\) is positive, the sequence \\( a_n = n^2 - 2n + 3 \\) will increase without bound as \\( n \\) increases. This implies that the sequence diverges to \\( +\\infty \\).\n\n3. **Slope Interpretation**: If we were to force a linear interpretation, the \"slope\" would be related to the coefficient of the linear term, which is \\( -2 \\).

Without this information, we cannot directly apply the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle to find the exact number of students who like at least one fruit.\n\nIn a typical survey problem like this, if no additional information is given about overlaps, one might assume that there are no overlaps, meaning no student likes more than one fruit.

More formally, there exist real numbers \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) such that:\n\n\\[\nf(x, y) = f(x_0, y_0) + A(x - x_0) + B(y - y_0) + \\epsilon(x, y)\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\epsilon(x, y)\\) is a function that goes to zero faster than the distance \\(\\sqrt{(x - x_0)^2 + (y - y_0)^2}\\) as \\((x, y) \\to (x_0, y_0)\\). This means that:\n\n\\[\n\\lim_{(x, y) \\to (x_0, y_0)} \\frac{\\epsilon(x, y)}{\\sqrt{(x - x_0)^2 + (y - y_0)^2}} = 0\n\\]\n\nThe numbers \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are precisely the partial derivatives of \\( f \\) at \\((x_0, y_0)\\). Specifically, \\( A \\) is the partial derivative of \\( f \\) with respect to \\( x \\) at \\((x_0, y_0)\\), denoted as \\( \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}(x_0, y_0) \\), and \\( B \\) is the partial derivative with respect to \\( y \\), denoted as \\( \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}(x_0, y_0) \\).\n\nTo see why this is the case, consider the definition of the partial derivative with respect to \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}(x_0, y_0) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(x_0 + h, y_0) - f(x_0, y_0)}{h}\n\\]\n\nUsing the differentiability condition, we substitute:\n\n\\[\nf(x_0 + h, y_0) = f(x_0, y_0) + A \\cdot h + B \\cdot 0 + \\epsilon(x_0 + h, y_0)\n\\]\n\nThus, the expression for the partial derivative becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{f(x_0 + h, y_0) - f(x_0, y_0)}{h} = A + \\frac{\\epsilon(x_0 + h, y_0)}{h}\n\\]\n\nAs \\( h \\to 0 \\), the term \\(\\frac{\\epsilon(x_0 + h, y_0)}{h}\\) goes to zero because \\(\\epsilon(x_0 + h, y_0)\\) goes to zero faster than \\( h \\). Therefore, the limit simplifies to \\( A \\).\n\nA similar argument applies for the partial derivative with respect to \\( y \\), showing that \\( B = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}(x_0, y_0) \\).\n\nThus, if \\( f \\) is differentiable at \\((x_0, y_0)\\), it must have partial derivatives at that point, and these partial derivatives are the coefficients \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) in the linear approximation of \\( f \\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  HasFDerivAt f fun p => (?m.1230 p, ?m.1231 p)\nargument\n  fun p => (?m.1230 p, ?m.1231 p)\nhas type\n  (p : \u211d \u00d7 \u211d) \u2192 ?m.1228 p \u00d7 ?m.1229 p : Type (max ?u.1222 ?u.1223)\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u211d \u00d7 \u211d \u2192L[?m.876] \u211d : Type\nfunction expected at\n  partialDeriv\nterm has type\n  ?m.870\nfunction expected at\n  partialDeriv\nterm has type\n  ?m.870\nPlease revise the proof.",

Consider the following values:\n- Let \\(a = 1\\),\n- Let \\(b = 2\\),\n- Let \\(c = 3\\),\n- Let \\(d = 4\\).\n\nNow, let's calculate both sides of the equation using these values:\n\n1. Calculate the left side: \\((a \\cdot b) + (c \\cdot d)\\).\n   - \\(a \\cdot b = 1 \\cdot 2 = 2\\).\n   - \\(c \\cdot d = 3 \\cdot 4 = 12\\).\n   - So, \\((a \\cdot b) + (c \\cdot d) = 2 + 12 = 14\\).\n\n2.

Therefore, the equation \\((a \\cdot b) + (c \\cdot d) = (a \\cdot c) + (b \\cdot d)\\) does not hold for these particular values of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(d\\).\n\nThis counterexample demonstrates that the equation is not universally true for all real numbers. By finding just one set of values where the equation fails, we have shown that it cannot be a general rule for all real numbers.",

Two vectors are orthogonal if their dot product is zero.\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of \\( r(t) \\). The function \\( r(t) \\) is given in terms of the cosine and sine functions, which are well-known trigonometric functions. The derivative of \\( \\cos(t) \\) with respect to \\( t \\) is \\( -\\sin(t) \\), and the derivative of \\( \\sin(t) \\) with respect to \\( t \\) is \\( \\cos(t) \\).

        "informal_proof": "# Informal Proof:\n\nTo understand the problem, we need to explore the concept of a change of basis matrix and how it relates to coordinate vectors in different bases. We have a vector space \\( V \\) with two different bases, \\( B = \\{v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_n\\} \\) and \\( C = \\{w_1, w_2, \\ldots, w_n\\} \\). For any vector \\( x \\) in \\( V \\), we can express it in terms of these bases, resulting in coordinate vectors \\([x]_B\\) and \\([x]_C\\).\n\nThe change of basis matrix \\( P \\) is a tool that allows us to convert the coordinates of a vector from one basis to another. Specifically, \\( P \\) is the matrix that transforms coordinates from the basis \\( B \\) to the basis \\( C \\).\n\nTo prove that \\([x]_C = P[x]_B\\) for any vector \\( x \\in V \\), let's break down the process:\n\n1. **Understanding Coordinate Vectors**: \n   - The coordinate vector \\([x]_B\\) represents \\( x \\) as a linear combination of the basis vectors in \\( B \\). This means if \\([x]_B = [a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n]^T\\), then \\( x = a_1v_1 + a_2v_2 + \\ldots + a_nv_n \\).\n   - Similarly, \\([x]_C\\) represents \\( x \\) as a linear combination of the basis vectors in \\( C \\). If \\([x]_C = [b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n]^T\\), then \\( x = b_1w_1 + b_2w_2 + \\ldots + b_nw_n \\).\n\n2. **Role of the Change of Basis Matrix \\( P \\)**:\n   - The matrix \\( P \\) is constructed such that it transforms the coordinates of any vector from the basis \\( B \\) to the basis \\( C \\). This means that if you have the coordinates of a vector with respect to \\( B \\), multiplying these coordinates by \\( P \\) will give you the coordinates with respect to \\( C \\).\n\n3. **Why \\([x]_C = P[x]_B\\)**:\n   - By definition, the change of basis matrix \\( P \\) is formed by expressing each vector in the basis \\( B \\) as a linear combination of the vectors in the basis \\( C \\). The columns of \\( P \\) are the coordinates of the vectors \\( v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_n \\) in terms of the basis \\( C \\).\n   - When you multiply \\( P \\) by \\([x]_B\\), you are effectively applying the linear transformation that re-expresses the vector \\( x \\) in terms of the new basis \\( C \\). This is because the linear combination of the columns of \\( P \\) with the coefficients from \\([x]_B\\) gives you the same vector \\( x \\), but now expressed in terms of the basis \\( C \\).\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Therefore, for any vector \\( x \\) in the vector space \\( V \\), multiplying its coordinate vector \\([x]_B\\) by the change of basis matrix \\( P \\) results in the coordinate vector \\([x]_C\\). This confirms that \\([x]_C = P[x]_B\\), as required.\n\nThis reasoning shows how the change of basis matrix \\( P \\) functions to convert coordinates between different bases, ensuring that the vector \\( x \\) remains the same in the vector space, just expressed differently.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown constant 'FiniteDimensional.Basis'\nunknown constant 'FiniteDimensional.Basis'\nexpected token\ntype expected, got\n  (?m.12068.toMatrix ?m.13485 : Matrix ?m.10768 ?m.10769 ?m.10770)\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

We start by understanding the initial conditions and the changes made to the cube.\n\nInitially, we have a large metal cube with a side length of 5 cm and a total mass of 20 g. The volume of a cube is calculated using the formula for the volume of a cube, which is the side length cubed. Therefore, the volume of the large cube is:\n\n\\[ V_{\\text{large}} = 5^3 = 125 \\text{ cubic centimeters} \\]\n\nNext, a smaller cube with a side length of 2 cm is removed from the larger cube. The volume of this smaller cube is:\n\n\\[ V_{\\text{small}} = 2^3 = 8 \\text{ cubic centimeters} \\]\n\nWe are given that the mass of the smaller cube is 7 g. This means that the mass of the material in the smaller cube is 7 g.\n\nTo find the mass of the remaining part of the large cube, we simply subtract the mass of the smaller cube from the mass of the original large cube. The mass of the remaining part is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Mass of remaining cube} = \\text{Mass of large cube} - \\text{Mass of small cube} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Mass of remaining cube} = 20 \\text{ g} - 7 \\text{ g} = 13 \\text{ g} \\]\n\nThus, the mass of the remaining metal cube, after the smaller cube has been removed, is 13 g.

The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. So, for rectangle \\( R \\) with length \\( l \\) and width \\( w \\), the area is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Area of } R = l \\times w. \\]\n\nNow, let's consider the transformation described in the problem. We increase the length of the rectangle by \\( a \\) units and decrease the width by \\( a \\) units. This gives us a new rectangle \\( R' \\) with length \\( l + a \\) and width \\( w - a \\).\n\nThe area of the transformed rectangle \\( R' \\) is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Area of } R' = (l + a) \\times (w - a). \\]\n\nTo find out if the area of \\( R' \\) is the same as the area of \\( R \\), we need to expand the expression for the area of \\( R' \\):\n\n\\[ (l + a) \\times (w - a) = l \\times w - l \\times a + a \\times w - a \\times a. \\]\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\n\\[ l \\times w - a \\times l + a \\times w - a^2. \\]\n\nNotice that the terms \\(- a \\times l\\) and \\(a \\times w\\) can be combined:\n\n\\[ l \\times w + a \\times (w - l) - a^2. \\]\n\nNow, let's consider the condition given in the problem. We want the area of \\( R' \\) to be equal to the area of \\( R \\), which is \\( l \\times w \\). For this to be true, the additional terms must cancel out:\n\n\\[ a \\times (w - l) - a^2 = 0. \\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[ a \\times (w - l) = a^2. \\]\n\nDividing both sides by \\( a \\) (assuming \\( a \\neq 0 \\)), we get:\n\n\\[ w - l = a. \\]\n\nThis means that the transformation is such that the increase in length exactly compensates for the decrease in width, maintaining the overall area.

In other words, the girls make up one-quarter of the entire student population.\n\n2. **Setting Up the Equation**: We know that the number of girls is 8.

Since both \\( B_1 \\) and \\( B_2 \\) are bases for \\( V \\), each vector in \\( V \\) can be uniquely expressed as a linear combination of the vectors in \\( B_1 \\) and also as a linear combination of the vectors in \\( B_2 \\). This means that for any vector \\( v \\in V \\), there exist unique scalars \\( a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n \\) such that:\n\n\\[ v = a_1 v_1 + a_2 v_2 + \\cdots + a_n v_n. \\]\n\nSimilarly, there exist unique scalars \\( b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n \\) such that:\n\n\\[ v = b_1 w_1 + b_2 w_2 + \\cdots + b_n w_n. \\]\n\nThe coordinate vector \\([v]_{B_1}\\) is \\((a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n)\\) and \\([v]_{B_2}\\) is \\((b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n)\\).\n\nNow, because \\( B_2 \\) is a basis, each vector \\( v_i \\) from \\( B_1 \\) can be expressed as a linear combination of the vectors in \\( B_2 \\). Specifically, for each \\( v_i \\), there exist unique scalars \\( c_{i1}, c_{i2}, \\ldots, c_{in} \\) such that:\n\n\\[ v_i = c_{i1} w_1 + c_{i2} w_2 + \\cdots + c_{in} w_n. \\]\n\nThese scalars form the columns of the matrix \\( A \\). Therefore, the matrix \\( A \\) is constructed such that its \\( i \\)-th column is the coordinate vector of \\( v_i \\) with respect to the basis \\( B_2 \\).\n\nTo show that this matrix \\( A \\) works for any vector \\( v \\), consider the coordinate vector \\([v]_{B_2} = (b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n)\\). The product \\( A \\cdot [v]_{B_2} \\) gives us a new vector, which is the coordinate vector of \\( v \\) with respect to \\( B_1 \\), i.e., \\([v]_{B_1}\\).\n\nFinally, the uniqueness of \\( A \\) follows from the fact that the expression of each basis vector \\( v_i \\) in terms of the basis \\( B_2 \\) is unique due to the linear independence of the basis vectors. Therefore, the matrix \\( A \\) that transforms coordinates from \\( B_2 \\) to \\( B_1 \\) is uniquely determined by these expressions.\n\nIn summary, the matrix \\( A \\) exists and is unique because it is constructed from the unique expressions of the basis vectors of \\( B_1 \\) in terms of the basis \\( B_2 \\), and it correctly transforms any vector's coordinates from one basis to the other.\nPrevious attempt failed with: function expected at\n  IsBasis\nterm has type\n  ?m.1184\nfunction expected at\n  IsBasis\nterm has type\n  ?m.1184\nunsolved goals\ncase h.left\nn : \u2115\nx\u271d : Sort u_2\nIsBasis : x\u271d\nV : Type u_1\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : AddCommGroup V\ninst\u271d : Module \u211d V\nB1 B2 : Fin n \u2192 V\nhB1 : sorryAx (Sort u_3) true\nhB2 : sorryAx (Sort u_4) true\nv : V\n\u22a2 sorryAx (Fin n \u2192 \u211d) true = (sorryAx (Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) \u211d) true).mulVec (sorryAx (Fin n \u2192 \u211d) true)\nPlease revise the proof.",

The area of rectangle ABCD is straightforward to calculate: it's the product of its sides, so the area is \\(a \\times b\\).\n\nNow, let's focus on the triangle ABE. We know that AE is a line segment that extends from A to a point E such that AE = AB + BC. This means that E lies on the line extended from the diagonal AC, but further out such that the length of AE is the sum of the lengths of AB and BC.\n\nTo find the area of triangle ABE, we need to determine its base and height. Notice that AB is one side of the rectangle, and it can serve as the base of the triangle ABE. The height of triangle ABE can be considered as the perpendicular distance from point E to line AB, which is essentially the same as the height of the rectangle, which is b.\n\nThe area of a triangle is given by the formula \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}\\).

This is equivalent to saying that \\( A \\) is invertible, meaning there exists an inverse matrix \\( A^{-1} \\).\n\nThe key condition given in the problem is that the determinant of \\( A \\) is non-zero. This is crucial because a non-zero determinant is a necessary and sufficient condition for a matrix to be invertible. Let's explore why this is the case:\n\n1. **Determinant and Invertibility**: For a 2x2 matrix \\( A = \\begin{bmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{bmatrix} \\), the determinant is calculated as \\( \\det(A) = ad - bc \\). If \\( \\det(A) \\neq 0 \\), it implies that the matrix \\( A \\) is invertible. This is because the determinant being non-zero ensures that the rows (or columns) of the matrix are linearly independent, meaning no row (or column) can be expressed as a linear combination of the others. This linear independence is what allows the matrix to have an inverse.\n\n2. **Existence of Inverse**: When \\( \\det(A) \\neq 0 \\), the inverse of \\( A \\), denoted as \\( A^{-1} \\), can be explicitly calculated using the formula for the inverse of a 2x2 matrix:\n   \\[\n   A^{-1} = \\frac{1}{\\det(A)} \\begin{bmatrix} d & -b \\\\ -c & a \\end{bmatrix}\n   \\]\n   This formula shows that \\( A^{-1} \\) exists and is well-defined when \\( \\det(A) \\neq 0 \\).\n\n3. **Transformation and Inversion**: Given that \\( A \\) transforms \\( v \\) to \\( w \\) (i.e., \\( Av = w \\)), applying the inverse matrix \\( A^{-1} \\) to \\( w \\) will yield the original vector \\( v \\). Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n   \\[\n   A^{-1}w = A^{-1}(Av) = (A^{-1}A)v = Iv = v\n   \\]\n   where \\( I \\) is the identity matrix, which leaves any vector unchanged when multiplied by it.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since \\( \\det(A) \\neq 0 \\) ensures the existence of \\( A^{-1} \\), and since applying \\( A^{-1} \\) to \\( w \\) results in \\( v \\), we conclude that the transformation by \\( A \\) can indeed be inverted. Therefore, there exists a matrix \\( B \\) (specifically \\( B = A^{-1} \\)) such that \\( B \\) transforms \\( w \\) back to \\( v \\).\n\nIn summary, the non-zero determinant of \\( A \\) guarantees that \\( A \\) is invertible, and thus the transformation can be reversed by applying the inverse matrix \\( A^{-1} \\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  B.mulVec w\nargument\n  w\nhas type\n  Vector \u211d 2 : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  Fin 2 \u2192 \u211d : Type\ntype mismatch\n  v\nhas type\n  Vector \u211d 2 : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  Fin 2 \u2192 \u211d : Type\ninvalid field 'mul', the environment does not contain 'Matrix.mul'\n  A_inv\nhas type\n  Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) \u211d\ninvalid field notation, type is not of the form (C ...) where C is a constant\n  A_inv\nhas type\n  Fin 2 \u2192 Fin 2 \u2192 \u211d\nunknown identifier 'exists_inverse_of_det_ne_zero'\nno goals to be solved\n(kernel) declaration has free variables 'transformation_invertible'\nPlease revise the proof.",

This means that the observed increase in the mean score to 85 is statistically significant at the 0.05 level, suggesting that the new teaching method likely has a positive effect on the students' test scores.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  HasEquiv \u211d\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nunsolved goals\n\u03bc : \u2115 := 80\n\u03c3 : \u2115 := 10\nx_bar : \u2115 := 85\nn : \u2115 := 30\n\u03b1 : Float := 5e-2\nSE : \u211d := \u2191\u03c3 / \u221a\u2191n\nz_score : \u211d := (\u2191x_bar - \u2191\u03bc) / SE\ncritical_z_value : Float := 1.645\nh1 : SE = 10 / \u221a30\nh2 : z_score = (85 - 80) / (10 / \u221a30)\nh3 : z_score = 5 * \u221a30 / 10\nh4 : z_score = \u221a30 / 2\n\u22a2 sorryAx (Sort ?u.6749) true\nfailed to synthesize\n  HasEquiv \u211d\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\n\u03bc : \u2115 := 80\n\u03c3 : \u2115 := 10\nx_bar : \u2115 := 85\nn : \u2115 := 30\n\u03b1 : Float := 5e-2\nSE : \u211d := \u2191\u03c3 / \u221a\u2191n\nz_score : \u211d := (\u2191x_bar - \u2191\u03bc) / SE\ncritical_z_value : Float := 1.645\nh1 : SE = 10 / \u221a30\nh2 : z_score = (85 - 80) / (10 / \u221a30)\nh3 : z_score = 5 * \u221a30 / 10\nh4 : z_score = \u221a30 / 2\nh5 : sorryAx (Sort ?u.6749) true\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nfailed to synthesize\n  HasEquiv \u211d\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nunsolved goals\n\u03bc : \u2115 := 80\n\u03c3 : \u2115 := 10\nx_bar : \u2115 := 85\nn : \u2115 := 30\n\u03b1 : Float := 5e-2\nSE : \u211d := \u2191\u03c3 / \u221a\u2191n\nz_score : \u211d := (\u2191x_bar - \u2191\u03bc) / SE\ncritical_z_value : Float := 1.645\nh1 : SE = 10 / \u221a30\nh2 : z_score = (85 - 80) / (10 / \u221a30)\nh3 : z_score = 5 * \u221a30 / 10\nh4 : z_score = \u221a30 / 2\nh5 : sorryAx (Sort ?u.6749) true\nh6 : sorryAx (Sort ?u.7066) true\n\u22a2 sorryAx (Sort ?u.7733) true\nunsolved goals\n\u03bc : \u2115 := 80\n\u03c3 : \u2115 := 10\nx_bar : \u2115 := 85\nn : \u2115 := 30\n\u03b1 : Float := 5e-2\nSE : \u211d := \u2191\u03c3 / \u221a\u2191n\nz_score : \u211d := (\u2191x_bar - \u2191\u03bc) / SE\ncritical_z_value : Float := 1.645\nh1 : SE = 10 / \u221a30\nh2 : z_score = (85 - 80) / (10 / \u221a30)\nh3 : z_score = 5 * \u221a30 / 10\nh4 : z_score = \u221a30 / 2\nh5 : sorryAx (Sort ?u.6749) true\nh6 : sorryAx (Sort ?u.7066) true\nh7 : sorryAx (Sort ?u.7733) true\n\u22a2 1.645 < 2.74\ntype mismatch\n  h8\nhas type\n  2.74 > 1.645 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  let \u03bc := 80;\n  let \u03c3 := 10;\n  let x_bar := 85;\n  let n := 30;\n  let \u03b1 := 5e-2;\n  let SE := \u03c3 / \u221an;\n  let z_score := (x_bar - \u03bc) / SE;\n  let critical_z_value := 1.645;\n  z_score > critical_z_value : Prop\nPlease revise the proof.",

We have two vectors in a 2-dimensional space: \\( \\mathbf{v} = (4, 3) \\) and \\( \\mathbf{w} = (7, 2) \\). The contingency table is structured as follows:\n\n|       | Category 1 | Category 2 |\n|-------|------------|------------|\n| Set v |       4    |       3    |\n| Set w |       7    |       2    |\n\nThe row sums of the table are simply the sums of the values in each row. For Set \\( \\mathbf{v} \\), the row sum is \\( 4 + 3 = 7 \\). For Set \\( \\mathbf{w} \\), the row sum is \\( 7 + 2 = 9 \\).\n\nNow, let's calculate the vector sum of \\( \\mathbf{v} \\) and \\( \\mathbf{w} \\). The vector sum is obtained by adding the corresponding components of the vectors:\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{w} = (4 + 7, 3 + 2) = (11, 5)\n\\]\n\nThe vector sum \\( (11, 5) \\) represents the total counts across both categories when combining the two sets. However, the problem asks us to match the vector sum to the row sums of the table, which are \\( 7 \\) and \\( 9 \\).\n\nTo clarify, the vector sum \\( (11, 5) \\) does not directly match the row sums \\( 7 \\) and \\( 9 \\). Instead, the vector sum represents the total counts across both categories, while the row sums represent the total counts for each set across all categories.\n\nThe Chi-square statistic is calculated based on the observed and expected frequencies in the contingency table. However, the problem does not require us to compute the Chi-square statistic explicitly, but rather to focus on the relationship between the vector sum and the row sums.\n\nIn conclusion, the vector sum \\( (11, 5) \\) reflects the combined total counts across categories, while the row sums \\( 7 \\) and \\( 9 \\) reflect the total counts for each set. The problem highlights the distinction between these two types of sums, emphasizing the structure of the contingency table and the interpretation of vector operations in this context.\nPrevious attempt failed with: The rfl tactic failed.

The formula for density (\\( \\rho \\)) is given by:\n\n\\[ \\rho = \\frac{\\text{mass}}{\\text{volume}} \\]\n\nFirst, let's calculate the volume of the rectangular prism. The volume (\\( V \\)) of a rectangular prism can be found using the formula:\n\n\\[ V = \\text{length} \\times \\text{width} \\times \\text{height} \\]\n\nGiven the dimensions of the prism, we have:\n\n- Length = 5 cm\n- Width = 3 cm\n- Height = 4 cm\n\nSubstituting these values into the volume formula, we get:\n\n\\[ V = 5 \\, \\text{cm} \\times 3 \\, \\text{cm} \\times 4 \\, \\text{cm} = 60 \\, \\text{cm}^3 \\]\n\nNow that we have the volume, we can calculate the density.

Using the density formula:\n\n\\[ \\rho = \\frac{\\text{mass}}{\\text{volume}} = \\frac{60 \\, \\text{grams}}{60 \\, \\text{cm}^3} \\]\n\nSimplifying this expression, we find:\n\n\\[ \\rho = 1 \\, \\text{gram/cm}^3 \\]\n\nTherefore, the density of the rectangular prism is 1 gram per cubic centimeter. This means that for every cubic centimeter of the prism, there is 1 gram of mass. This calculation aligns with the definition of mass density, which relates mass to the space it occupies.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\n'height' has already been declared\nfailed to synthesize\n  HMul \u211d ((\u03b1 : Type ?u.192) \u2192 [inst : Preorder \u03b1] \u2192 \u03b1 \u2192 WithBot (WithTop \u2115)) ?m.14352\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'density', and it does not have executable code\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

The particle's motion is described by parametric equations, which are functions of time.\n\nFirst, let's understand the setup. We have a particle moving in a circle with a radius \\( r = 5 \\) units. The particle moves at a constant speed \\( s = 10 \\) units per second. The parametric equations for the motion of the particle are given as \\( x = r \\cos(\\omega t) \\) and \\( y = r \\sin(\\omega t) \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is the angular velocity.\n\nThe angular velocity \\( \\omega \\) is a measure of how fast the particle is moving around the circle in terms of angle per unit time. From the context, we know that the angular velocity \\( \\omega \\) is related to the speed \\( s \\) and the radius \\( r \\) by the formula \\( \\omega = \\frac{s}{r} \\). This formula makes sense because the speed \\( s \\) is the linear speed along the circumference of the circle, and dividing by the radius \\( r \\) converts this linear speed into angular speed.\n\nSubstituting the given values into the formula for angular velocity, we have:\n\\[ \\omega = \\frac{10}{5} = 2 \\text{ radians per second}. \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the position of the particle at \\( t = 2 \\) seconds. We substitute \\( \\omega = 2 \\) and \\( t = 2 \\) into the parametric equations:\n\n1. For the \\( x \\)-coordinate:\n   \\[\n   x = r \\cos(\\omega t) = 5 \\cos(2 \\times 2) = 5 \\cos(4).\n   \\]\n\n2. For the \\( y \\)-coordinate:\n   \\[\n   y = r \\sin(\\omega t) = 5 \\sin(2 \\times 2) = 5 \\sin(4).\n   \\]\n\nThe values of \\( \\cos(4) \\) and \\( \\sin(4) \\) are trigonometric functions evaluated at 4 radians. These can be calculated using a calculator or trigonometric tables.\n\nThus, the coordinates of the particle at \\( t = 2 \\) seconds are \\( (5 \\cos(4), 5 \\sin(4)) \\).\n\nIn summary, by understanding the relationship between linear speed, angular velocity, and the parametric equations of circular motion, we can determine the position of the particle at any given time.

It is the area under the curve \\( y = f(x) \\) from \\( x = a \\) to \\( x = c \\). Since \\( c \\) is within the interval \\([a, b]\\), this area is a part of the total area \\( A \\), which is the area under the curve from \\( x = a \\) to \\( x = b\\).\n\nNow, because \\( f(x) \\ge 0 \\) for all \\( x \\) in \\([a, b]\\), the function does not dip below the x-axis, ensuring that the area under the curve is non-negative. This means that as we move from \\( x = a \\) to \\( x = b \\), the area accumulates, and the integral \\(\\int_a^c f(x) \\, dx\\) is simply the accumulated area up to \\( x = c \\).\n\nSince \\( c \\) is less than or equal to \\( b \\), the area from \\( x = a \\) to \\( x = c \\) cannot exceed the total area from \\( x = a \\) to \\( x = b \\). In other words, the area under the curve from \\( a \\) to \\( c \\) is a subset of the area from \\( a \\) to \\( b \\). Therefore, it must be that:\n\n\\[\n\\int_a^c f(x) \\, dx \\le \\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx = A\n\\]\n\nThis inequality holds because the integral from \\( a \\) to \\( c \\) only covers part of the interval \\([a, b]\\), and since \\( f(x) \\) is non-negative, the area cannot decrease as we extend the interval from \\( c \\) to \\( b \\).\n\nThus, for any \\( c \\) in \\([a, b]\\), the integral \\(\\int_a^c f(x) \\, dx\\) is always less than or equal to the total area \\( A \\), which completes the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

The chain rule states that if you have a function \\( g(x) = h(u(x)) \\), then the derivative \\( g'(x) \\) is given by \\( h'(u(x)) \\cdot u'(x) \\).\n\nIn our case, the function \\( f(x) = e^{2x} \\) can be seen as a composition of two functions: the exponential function \\( h(u) = e^u \\) and the linear function \\( u(x) = 2x \\). \n\n1. **Differentiate the outer function**: The derivative of the exponential function \\( h(u) = e^u \\) with respect to \\( u \\) is simply \\( e^u \\). So, \\( h'(u) = e^u \\).\n\n2. **Differentiate the inner function**: The derivative of the linear function \\( u(x) = 2x \\) with respect to \\( x \\) is \\( 2 \\).

Each disk has a small thickness \\( \\Delta x \\) and a radius that changes as you move from the base to the top of the cone. The idea is to sum up the volumes of all these disks to get the total volume of the cone.\n\nThe radius of each disk at a height \\( x \\) from the apex can be described by a linear function because the cone tapers linearly from the base to the apex. This function is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\map R x = \\frac{r}{h} x\n\\]\n\nThis equation comes from the fact that at the base (\\( x = h \\)), the radius is \\( r \\), and at the apex (\\( x = 0 \\)), the radius is 0. The function \\(\\map R x\\) describes a line that starts at the origin and ends at the point \\((h, r)\\).\n\nThe volume of a thin disk at height \\( x \\) is approximately the area of the circle times its thickness, which is:\n\n\\[\n\\pi (\\map R x)^2 \\Delta x = \\pi \\left(\\frac{r}{h} x\\right)^2 \\Delta x\n\\]\n\nTo find the total volume of the cone, we integrate this expression from \\( x = 0 \\) to \\( x = h \\):\n\n\\[\nV = \\pi \\int_0^h \\left(\\frac{r}{h} x\\right)^2 \\, dx\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the integrand, we have:\n\n\\[\nV = \\pi \\left(\\frac{r}{h}\\right)^2 \\int_0^h x^2 \\, dx\n\\]\n\nThe integral of \\( x^2 \\) is \\(\\frac{x^3}{3}\\), so we evaluate this from 0 to \\( h \\):\n\n\\[\nV = \\pi \\left(\\frac{r}{h}\\right)^2 \\left[\\frac{x^3}{3}\\right]_0^h = \\pi \\left(\\frac{r}{h}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{h^3}{3} - 0\\right)\n\\]\n\nSimplifying further, we get:\n\n\\[\nV = \\pi \\left(\\frac{r}{h}\\right)^2 \\frac{h^3}{3} = \\pi \\frac{r^2 h^2}{h^2} \\frac{h}{3} = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2 h\n\\]\n\nThus, the volume of the cone is \\(\\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2 h\\), which matches the formula we set out to prove. This result makes intuitive sense because the volume of a cone is one-third the volume of a cylinder with the same base and height.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown namespace 'Real'\nexpected token\nunknown constant 'CoeFun'\nunknown constant 'sorryAx'\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "# Informal Proof:\n\nTo prove that the limit of the function \\( f(x) = x^3 \\) as \\( x \\) approaches 2 is 8, we need to understand what it means for a limit to exist. Specifically, we want to show that as \\( x \\) gets closer and closer to 2, the value of \\( f(x) = x^3 \\) gets closer and closer to 8.\n\nLet's break this down:\n\n1. **Substitute and Evaluate**: First, let's substitute \\( x = 2 \\) directly into the function \\( f(x) = x^3 \\). Doing this gives us \\( f(2) = 2^3 = 8 \\). This suggests that when \\( x \\) is exactly 2, \\( f(x) \\) is 8. However, the limit is concerned with what happens as \\( x \\) approaches 2, not just when \\( x \\) is exactly 2.\n\n2. **Approaching from Both Sides**: Consider values of \\( x \\) that are very close to 2, both from the left (values slightly less than 2) and from the right (values slightly more than 2). For example, if \\( x = 1.9 \\), then \\( f(1.9) = (1.9)^3 = 6.859 \\), which is close to 8. If \\( x = 2.1 \\), then \\( f(2.1) = (2.1)^3 = 9.261 \\), which is also close to 8.\n\n3. **Getting Closer**: As we choose values of \\( x \\) that are even closer to 2, such as \\( x = 1.99 \\) or \\( x = 2.01 \\), the values of \\( f(x) \\) become \\( f(1.99) = (1.99)^3 = 7.880599 \\) and \\( f(2.01) = (2.01)^3 = 8.120601 \\). These values are even closer to 8.\n\n4. **General Observation**: The closer \\( x \\) gets to 2, the closer \\( x^3 \\) gets to 8. This is because the function \\( f(x) = x^3 \\) is continuous, meaning there are no jumps or breaks in the graph of the function. As a result, small changes in \\( x \\) near 2 result in small changes in \\( f(x) \\) near 8.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Based on this reasoning, we can conclude that the limit of \\( f(x) = x^3 \\) as \\( x \\) approaches 2 is indeed 8. This is consistent with the definition of a limit, which states that for every small positive number \\( \\epsilon \\), there exists a small positive number \\( \\delta \\) such that if \\( |x - 2| < \\delta \\), then \\( |x^3 - 8| < \\epsilon \\).\n\nThus, we have shown informally that the limit of \\( f(x) = x^3 \\) as \\( x \\) approaches 2 is 8.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  AddGroup \u2115\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  AddGroup \u2115\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  AddGroup \u2115\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase h\n\u03b5 : \u2115\n\u03b5_pos : \u03b5 > 0\nx : \u2115\nhx : |x - 2| = 0\na\u271d : sorryAx \u2115 true \u2265 1\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nfailed to synthesize\n  AddGroup \u2115\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  AddGroup \u2115\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  AddGroup \u2115\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  AddGroup \u2115\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  AddGroup \u2115\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  AddGroup \u2115\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  AddGroup \u2115\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nunsolved goals\n\u03b5 : \u2115\n\u03b5_pos : \u03b5 > 0\nx : \u2115\nhx : |x - 2| = 0\nh : sorryAx \u2115 true < 1\n\u22a2 |x * (x * x) - 8| = |x * (x * x) - 2 ^ 3|\n\ncase right.refine_1\n\u03b5 : \u2115\n\u03b5_pos : \u03b5 > 0\nx : \u2115\nhx : |x - 2| = 0\nh : sorryAx \u2115 true < 1\n\u22a2 AddGroup \u2115\n\n\u03b5 : \u2115\n\u03b5_pos : \u03b5 > 0\nx : \u2115\nhx : |x - 2| = 0\nh : sorryAx \u2115 true < 1\n\u22a2 AddGroup \u2115\nunknown identifier 'abs_pow_three_sub_pow_three'\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase h\n\u03b5 : \u2115\n\u03b5_pos : \u03b5 > 0\nx : \u2115\nhx : |x - 2| = 0\nh : sorryAx \u2115 true < 1\na\u271d : 0 \u2265 |x ^ 2 + 2 * x + 4|\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nunsolved goals\n\u03b5 : \u2115\n\u03b5_pos : \u03b5 > 0\nx : \u2115\nhx : |x - 2| = 0\nh : sorryAx \u2115 true < 1\n\u22a2 |x ^ 2 + 2 * x + 4| = |x ^ 2 + 2 * x + 4|\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase a\n\u03b5 : \u2115\n\u03b5_pos : \u03b5 > 0\nx : \u2115\nhx : |x - 2| = 0\nh : sorryAx \u2115 true < 1\na\u271d : x > 3\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase a\n\u03b5 : \u2115\n\u03b5_pos : \u03b5 > 0\nx : \u2115\nhx : |x - 2| = 0\nh : sorryAx \u2115 true < 1\nh2 : x \u2264 3\na\u271d : 1 > x\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase a\n\u03b5 : \u2115\n\u03b5_pos : \u03b5 > 0\nx : \u2115\nhx : |x - 2| = 0\nh : sorryAx \u2115 true < 1\nh2 : x \u2264 3\nh3 : x \u2265 1\na\u271d : x ^ 2 + 2 * x + 4 > 15\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase a\n\u03b5 : \u2115\n\u03b5_pos : \u03b5 > 0\nx : \u2115\nhx : |x - 2| = 0\nh : sorryAx \u2115 true < 1\nh1 : x ^ 2 + 2 * x + 4 \u2264 15\na\u271d : |x ^ 2 + 2 * x + 4| > 15\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase h\n\u03b5 : \u2115\n\u03b5_pos : \u03b5 > 0\nx : \u2115\nhx : |x - 2| = 0\nh : sorryAx \u2115 true < 1\na\u271d : 15 \u2265 \u03b5\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nPlease revise the proof.",

A rational number is any number that can be expressed as the fraction of two integers, where the denominator is not zero. So, if we have two rational numbers, \\( \\frac{a}{b} \\) and \\( \\frac{c}{d} \\), this means that \\( a, b, c, \\) and \\( d \\) are integers, and \\( b \\) and \\( d \\) are not zero.\n\nNow, let's consider the sum of these two rational numbers:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{b} + \\frac{c}{d}\n\\]\n\nTo add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The simplest way to find a common denominator is to multiply the denominators of the two fractions, which gives us \\( bd \\). So, we rewrite each fraction with this common denominator:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{b} = \\frac{a \\cdot d}{b \\cdot d} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{c}{d} = \\frac{c \\cdot b}{d \\cdot b}\n\\]\n\nNow, both fractions have the same denominator, \\( bd \\), and we can add them:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a \\cdot d}{b \\cdot d} + \\frac{c \\cdot b}{d \\cdot b} = \\frac{a \\cdot d + c \\cdot b}{b \\cdot d}\n\\]\n\nIn this expression, the numerator \\( a \\cdot d + c \\cdot b \\) is the sum of two products of integers, which is itself an integer. The denominator \\( b \\cdot d \\) is the product of two non-zero integers, which is also a non-zero integer. Therefore, the sum \\( \\frac{a \\cdot d + c \\cdot b}{b \\cdot d} \\) is a fraction where both the numerator and the denominator are integers, and the denominator is not zero.\n\nThus, the sum of \\( \\frac{a}{b} \\) and \\( \\frac{c}{d} \\) is a rational number, as it can be expressed as a fraction of two integers with a non-zero denominator.

A common method to solve such equations is to use the technique of separation of variables. This involves rearranging the equation so that all terms involving \\(y\\) are on one side and all terms involving \\(x\\) are on the other side.\n\nStarting with the given equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{dy}{dx} = -2y\n\\]\n\nwe can separate the variables by dividing both sides by \\(y\\) and multiplying both sides by \\(dx\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{y} \\, dy = -2 \\, dx\n\\]\n\nNow, we integrate both sides. The left side is integrated with respect to \\(y\\), and the right side is integrated with respect to \\(x\\):\n\n\\[\n\\int \\frac{1}{y} \\, dy = \\int -2 \\, dx\n\\]\n\nThe integral of \\(\\frac{1}{y}\\) with respect to \\(y\\) is \\(\\ln |y|\\), and the integral of \\(-2\\) with respect to \\(x\\) is \\(-2x\\).

The modulus of \\( z \\), denoted as \\( |z| \\), is defined as the distance from the origin to the point \\( (a, b) \\) in the complex plane.

This is crucial because it implies that the image of a line (which is a set of points satisfying a linear equation) under a linear transformation will also satisfy a linear equation.\n\nTo see why this is the case, consider two points \\(\\mathbf{x}_1\\) and \\(\\mathbf{x}_2\\) on the line \\( ax + by + c = 0 \\). For any scalar \\(\\lambda\\), the point \\(\\lambda \\mathbf{x}_1 + (1-\\lambda) \\mathbf{x}_2\\) is also on the line, due to the linearity of the equation. When we apply the transformation \\( T \\), we get:\n\n\\[ T(\\lambda \\mathbf{x}_1 + (1-\\lambda) \\mathbf{x}_2) = \\mathbf{A}(\\lambda \\mathbf{x}_1 + (1-\\lambda) \\mathbf{x}_2) = \\lambda \\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x}_1 + (1-\\lambda) \\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x}_2. \\]\n\nThis shows that the image of any linear combination of points on the original line is a linear combination of the images of those points. Therefore, the set of all such images forms a line in the transformed space.\n\nMoreover, since \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) is a linear transformation, it can be expressed as a matrix multiplication, which is known to distribute over addition and is homogeneous of degree 1. This means that the structure of the line is preserved under the transformation.\n\nIn conclusion, the image of the line \\( ax + by + c = 0 \\) under the transformation \\( T \\) is another line in \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\). The specific equation of this new line will depend on the entries of the matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}\\), but it will still be a linear equation, confirming that the image is indeed a line.\nPrevious attempt failed with: expected token\nexpected token\nexpected token\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

This is a straightforward division problem, but let's break it down step by step to ensure clarity.\n\nFirst, consider the numbers involved: 7.5 and 2.5. Both of these numbers are decimal numbers, but they can be easily converted into fractions to simplify the division process. \n\n- 7.5 can be expressed as the fraction \\(\\frac{75}{10}\\), which simplifies to \\(\\frac{15}{2}\\) by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 5.\n- Similarly, 2.5 can be expressed as the fraction \\(\\frac{25}{10}\\), which simplifies to \\(\\frac{5}{2}\\) by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 5.\n\nNow, the problem of dividing 7.5 by 2.5 becomes a problem of dividing the fraction \\(\\frac{15}{2}\\) by the fraction \\(\\frac{5}{2}\\).\n\nIn fraction division, dividing by a fraction is equivalent to multiplying by its reciprocal. Therefore, we can rewrite the division as a multiplication:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{15}{2} \\div \\frac{5}{2} = \\frac{15}{2} \\times \\frac{2}{5}\n\\]\n\nWhen multiplying fractions, we multiply the numerators together and the denominators together:\n\n- The numerator becomes \\(15 \\times 2 = 30\\).\n- The denominator becomes \\(2 \\times 5 = 10\\).\n\nThus, the result of the multiplication is the fraction \\(\\frac{30}{10}\\).\n\nFinally, we simplify the fraction \\(\\frac{30}{10}\\) by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 10:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{30}{10} = \\frac{30 \\div 10}{10 \\div 10} = \\frac{3}{1} = 3\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the result of dividing 7.5 by 2.5 is 3.

        "informal_proof": "# Informal Proof:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that triangle \\( BPC \\) is obtuse when point \\( P \\) is chosen randomly inside square \\( ABCD \\).\n\nFirst, let's recall what it means for a triangle to be obtuse. A triangle is obtuse if one of its angles is greater than \\( 90^\\circ \\). In the context of triangle \\( BPC \\), this means that either angle \\( \\angle BPC \\), \\( \\angle PBC \\), or \\( \\angle PCB \\) must be greater than \\( 90^\\circ \\).\n\nSince \\( P \\) is chosen randomly inside the square, we can think of the square as a coordinate plane with \\( B \\) at \\( (0, 0) \\), \\( C \\) at \\( (2, 0) \\), \\( D \\) at \\( (2, 2) \\), and \\( A \\) at \\( (0, 2) \\). The point \\( P \\) can be any point \\((x, y)\\) where \\( 0 \\leq x \\leq 2 \\) and \\( 0 \\leq y \\leq 2 \\).\n\nTo find when triangle \\( BPC \\) is obtuse, we need to consider the conditions under which each angle in the triangle becomes obtuse:\n\n1. **Angle \\( \\angle BPC \\) is obtuse**: This happens when the dot product of vectors \\( \\overrightarrow{BP} \\) and \\( \\overrightarrow{CP} \\) is negative. The vectors are \\( \\overrightarrow{BP} = (x, y) \\) and \\( \\overrightarrow{CP} = (x-2, y) \\). The dot product is \\( x(x-2) + y^2 \\). For this to be negative, \\( x(x-2) + y^2 < 0 \\).\n\n2. **Angle \\( \\angle PBC \\) is obtuse**: This occurs when the dot product of vectors \\( \\overrightarrow{PB} \\) and \\( \\overrightarrow{BC} \\) is negative. The vectors are \\( \\overrightarrow{PB} = (-x, -y) \\) and \\( \\overrightarrow{BC} = (2, 0) \\). The dot product is \\(-2x\\). For this to be negative, \\( x > 0 \\).\n\n3. **Angle \\( \\angle PCB \\) is obtuse**: This happens when the dot product of vectors \\( \\overrightarrow{PC} \\) and \\( \\overrightarrow{CB} \\) is negative. The vectors are \\( \\overrightarrow{PC} = (2-x, -y) \\) and \\( \\overrightarrow{CB} = (-2, 0) \\). The dot product is \\(-2(2-x)\\). For this to be negative, \\( x < 2 \\).\n\nNow, let's consider the region where \\( \\angle BPC \\) is obtuse. The inequality \\( x(x-2) + y^2 < 0 \\) describes a region inside the square. Solving this inequality, we find that it represents a region bounded by a parabola opening to the right with its vertex at \\( (1, 0) \\).\n\nThe region where \\( \\angle PBC \\) or \\( \\angle PCB \\) is obtuse is simpler: \\( x > 0 \\) and \\( x < 2 \\) respectively, which are always true for any point inside the square.\n\nThus, the main condition that determines the obtuseness of triangle \\( BPC \\) is \\( x(x-2) + y^2 < 0 \\). This region is a subset of the square, and its area can be calculated by integrating the inequality over the domain of the square.\n\nFinally, the probability that triangle \\( BPC \\) is obtuse is the ratio of the area of this region to the area of the square. Since the square has an area of \\( 4 \\) square units, we compute the area of the region where \\( x(x-2) + y^2 < 0 \\) and divide by \\( 4 \\) to find the probability.\n\nThis approach gives us a clear path to determine the probability that triangle \\( BPC \\) is obtuse when \\( P \\) is chosen randomly inside the square.\nPrevious attempt failed with: invalid declaration name 'A', there is a section variable with the same name\ninvalid declaration name 'B', there is a section variable with the same name\ninvalid declaration name 'C', there is a section variable with the same name\ninvalid declaration name 'D', there is a section variable with the same name\ntype of theorem 'obtuseProbability' is not a proposition\n  \u211d\nunknown identifier 'obtuseProbability'\nPlease revise the proof.",

According to the problem, he played basketball for 2.5 hours. \n\nNext, we look at the time he spent playing video games, which is given as 1.75 hours.\n\nTo find the total time spent on both activities, we simply add these two amounts together:\n\n- Start with the hours: 2.5 hours for basketball.\n- Add the hours spent on video games: 1.75 hours.\n\nWhen adding these two numbers, it's helpful to think of them in terms of fractions or decimals:\n\n- 2.5 hours can be thought of as 2 hours and 0.5 hours (or 2 hours and 30 minutes).\n- 1.75 hours can be thought of as 1 hour and 0.75 hours (or 1 hour and 45 minutes).\n\nNow, let's add them:\n\n1.

In mathematics, an identity element is a special type of number that, when used in an operation with any other number, leaves that number unchanged. For multiplication, the identity element is 1.\n\nLet's consider any integer \\( n \\). According to the properties of multiplication, multiplying \\( n \\) by 1 should not change its value. This is because 1 is defined as the multiplicative identity. The formal statement of this property is: for any integer \\( n \\), \\( n \\times 1 = n \\) and \\( 1 \\times n = n \\).\n\nTo understand why this is true, think about what multiplication by 1 means. When you multiply a number by 1, you are essentially saying, \"Take one whole of this number.\" So, if you have 5 and you multiply it by 1, you are taking one whole of 5, which is just 5. Similarly, if you have -3 and multiply it by 1, you are taking one whole of -3, which is -3.\n\nThis property is not just a rule we follow; it is a fundamental aspect of how numbers and multiplication are defined. The identity element in multiplication ensures that the structure of numbers remains consistent and predictable. This property is crucial in various mathematical operations and proofs, as it allows us to simplify expressions and solve equations without altering the values involved.\n\nIn summary, the reason why multiplying any number by 1 results in the number itself is because 1 is the identity element for multiplication.

This is because the integral of \\(\\sin(\\phi)\\) is \\(-\\cos(\\phi)\\), and evaluating from 0 to \\(\\pi\\) gives \\(-(-1) - (-1) = 2\\).\n\n- **Integrate with respect to \\( \\theta \\):** The integral of 1 with respect to \\( \\theta \\) from 0 to \\( 2\\pi \\) is \\( 2\\pi \\).\n\nPutting it all together, the volume \\( V \\) is:\n\n\\[ V = \\left(\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\theta\\right) \\left(\\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\sin(\\phi) \\, d\\phi\\right) \\left(\\int_{0}^{R} r^2 \\, dr\\right) = 2\\pi \\times 2 \\times \\frac{R^3}{3}. \\]\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\n\\[ V = \\frac{4\\pi R^3}{3}. \\]\n\nThus, the volume of a sphere with radius \\( R \\) is \\(\\frac{4\\pi R^3}{3}\\), which matches the well-known formula for the volume of a sphere. This method using spherical coordinates and triple integration provides a clear and systematic way to derive this result.\nPrevious attempt failed with: invalid projection, structure has only 1 field(s)\n  0.\nhas type\n  Float\ninvalid field '\u03c0', the environment does not contain 'Float.\u03c0'\n  0.\nhas type\n  Float\ninvalid field 'R', the environment does not contain 'Float.R'\n  0.\nhas type\n  Float\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

We start with the number 1. The rule for generating the sequence is that each subsequent number is obtained by adding 5 to the previous number. This means the sequence looks like this: 1, 6, 11, 16, 21, and so on.\n\nTo find the 20th number in this sequence, we need to determine the pattern or formula that gives us the nth term of the sequence. Notice that the first term (n = 1) is 1. The second term (n = 2) is 1 + 5 = 6. The third term (n = 3) is 6 + 5 = 11, which can also be written as 1 + 2*5. Continuing this pattern, the nth term can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ a_n = 1 + (n-1) \\times 5 \\]\n\nThis formula makes sense because for the first term, we add zero 5s (since n-1 = 0), for the second term, we add one 5, for the third term, we add two 5s, and so on.\n\nNow, we simply need to plug n = 20 into this formula to find the 20th term:\n\n\\[ a_{20} = 1 + (20-1) \\times 5 \\]\n\\[ a_{20} = 1 + 19 \\times 5 \\]\n\\[ a_{20} = 1 + 95 \\]\n\\[ a_{20} = 96 \\]\n\nTherefore, the 20th number in the sequence is 96.

When drawing two cards from a deck of 52, the first card can be any of the 52 cards, and the second card can be any of the remaining 51 cards. Therefore, the total number of ways to draw two cards is the product of these two numbers, which is \\(52 \\times 51\\).\n\nNext, we need to find the number of favorable outcomes, which is the number of ways to draw two aces. In a standard deck, there are 4 aces. For the first card, we have 4 choices (since there are 4 aces), and for the second card, we have 3 choices (since one ace has already been drawn). Thus, the number of ways to draw two aces is \\(4 \\times 3\\).\n\nNow, we can calculate the probability by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes.

A function \\( f(x) \\) is differentiable on \\( (a, b) \\) if it has a derivative at every point in that interval. The derivative, \\( f'(x) \\), represents the rate of change or the slope of the tangent line to the curve at any point \\( x \\).\n\nNow, according to the problem, \\( f'(x) = 0 \\) for all \\( x \\) in \\( (a, b) \\). This means that at every point in the interval, the slope of the tangent line to the curve is zero. A zero slope indicates that the tangent line is horizontal, suggesting that the function does not change as \\( x \\) varies within the interval.\n\nTo make this more rigorous, we apply the Mean Value Theorem. The theorem states that if a function is continuous on a closed interval \\([c, d]\\) and differentiable on the open interval \\((c, d)\\), then there exists at least one point \\( \\xi \\) in \\((c, d)\\) such that:\n\n\\[\nf'( \\xi ) = \\frac{f(d) - f(c)}{d - c}\n\\]\n\nIn our case, since \\( f'(x) = 0 \\) for all \\( x \\) in \\((a, b)\\), the Mean Value Theorem implies that for any two points \\( c \\) and \\( d \\) in \\((a, b)\\), the average rate of change of the function over \\([c, d]\\) is zero. Therefore, we have:\n\n\\[\n0 = \\frac{f(d) - f(c)}{d - c}\n\\]\n\nThis equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nf(d) - f(c) = 0\n\\]\n\nwhich means:\n\n\\[\nf(d) = f(c)\n\\]\n\nSince \\( c \\) and \\( d \\) were arbitrary points in \\((a, b)\\), this result shows that the function \\( f(x) \\) takes the same value at any two points in the interval. Therefore, \\( f(x) \\) is constant on \\((a, b)\\).\n\nIn summary, the condition \\( f'(x) = 0 \\) for all \\( x \\) in \\((a, b)\\) ensures that the function does not change its value throughout the interval, confirming that \\( f(x) \\) is indeed a constant function on \\((a, b)\\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: unexpected token '\u2208'; expected ','\nfunction expected at\n  Ioo\nterm has type\n  ?m.91\nfunction expected at\n  Ioo\nterm has type\n  ?m.91\nunsolved goals\ncase h\nx\u271d : Sort u_1\nIoo : x\u271d\nf : \u211d \u2192 \u211d\na b : \u211d\nhab : a < b\nhf : \u2200 x \u2208 ?m.2771 f a b hab x, HasDerivAt f 0 x\n\u22a2 (x : ?m.2785) \u2192 ?m.2791 x \u2192 sorryAx (Sort ?u.2790) true\n\nx\u271d : Sort u_1\nIoo : x\u271d\nf : \u211d \u2192 \u211d\na b : \u211d\nhab : a < b\nhf : \u2200 x \u2208 ?m.2771 f a b hab x, HasDerivAt f 0 x\nh : (x : ?m.2785) \u2192 ?m.2791 x \u2192 sorryAx (Sort ?u.2790) true\n\u22a2 \u2203 c, \u2200 x \u2208 ?m.2770 f a b hab hf c x, f x = c\nPlease revise the proof.",

Each matrix can be represented as:\n\n\\[ A = \\begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} \\\\ a_{21} & a_{22} \\end{bmatrix} \\]\n\\[ B = \\begin{bmatrix} b_{11} & b_{12} \\\\ b_{21} & b_{22} \\end{bmatrix} \\]\n\nThe sum of these matrices, A + B, is obtained by adding their corresponding entries:\n\n\\[ A + B = \\begin{bmatrix} a_{11} + b_{11} & a_{12} + b_{12} \\\\ a_{21} + b_{21} & a_{22} + b_{22} \\end{bmatrix} \\]\n\nNow, let's consider a linear transformation T that we apply to matrices. A key property of linear transformations is that they preserve addition. This means that for any matrices X and Y, the transformation of their sum is the same as the sum of their transformations:\n\n\\[ T(X + Y) = T(X) + T(Y) \\]\n\nApplying this property to our matrices A and B, we have:\n\n1. **Transformation of the Sum (T(A + B)):**  \n   We first compute the sum A + B, as shown above, and then apply the transformation T to this resulting matrix.\n\n2. **Sum of the Transformations (T(A) + T(B)):**  \n   We apply the transformation T to each matrix individually, resulting in T(A) and T(B), and then add these two transformed matrices together.\n\nAccording to the property of linear transformations, these two results should be the same:\n\n\\[ T(A + B) = T(A) + T(B) \\]\n\nThus, the sum of the transformations of A and B is indeed equivalent to the transformation of the sum of A and B. This conclusion relies on the fundamental property of linear transformations that they distribute over addition, which is a cornerstone of linear algebra. Therefore, the problem statement holds true under the assumption that T is a linear transformation.",

This rule states that the implication \"if \\( p \\) then \\( q \\)\" is logically equivalent to \"if not \\( q \\) then not \\( p \\)\". We are tasked with proving one direction of this equivalence: if \"not \\( q \\) implies not \\( p \\)\", then \" \\( p \\) implies \\( q \\)\".\n\nLet's break down the reasoning step by step:\n\n1. **Assume the Premise**: We start by assuming the premise of our implication, which is \"not \\( q \\) implies not \\( p \\)\". This means that whenever \\( q \\) is false, \\( p \\) must also be false.\n\n2. **Assume \\( p \\) is True**: Next, we assume that \\( p \\) is true. Our goal is to show that under this assumption, \\( q \\) must also be true.\n\n3. **Use Double Negation**: Since we have assumed \\( p \\) is true, we can introduce a double negation to say \"not not \\( p \\)\" is true. This is a logical maneuver that doesn't change the truth value but is useful for our next step.\n\n4. **Apply Modus Tollens**: Now, we use a logical rule called Modus Tollens. This rule allows us to infer the negation of the antecedent from the negation of the consequent in an implication. Since we have \"not \\( q \\) implies not \\( p \\)\" and we know \"not not \\( p \\)\" (which is just \\( p \\)), we can conclude \"not not \\( q \\)\", which simplifies to \\( q \\).\n\n5. **Conclude \\( q \\) is True**: Having derived that \\( q \\) is true, we have shown that if \\( p \\) is true, then \\( q \\) must also be true.\n\n6. **Form the Implication**: We have now shown that assuming \"not \\( q \\) implies not \\( p \\)\" leads us to conclude \"if \\( p \\) then \\( q \\)\". This completes the proof of the reverse implication of the Rule of Transposition.\n\nIn summary, by assuming the negation of the conclusion and using logical rules like double negation and Modus Tollens, we have shown that the original implication holds. This demonstrates the logical equivalence between the two statements, completing our proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  h hp\nargument\n  hp\nhas type\n  p : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u00acq : Prop\napplication type mismatch\n  hnq hnq\nargument\n  hnq\nhas type\n  \u00acq : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  q : Prop\nPlease revise the proof.",

Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nInitially, Sally has 1/2 of a pizza. This is the starting amount of pizza she possesses.\n\nFirst, Sally eats 1/4 of the 1/2 pizza she has. To find out how much pizza this is, we need to multiply 1/4 by 1/2. When multiplying fractions, we multiply the numerators together and the denominators together:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1 \\times 1}{4 \\times 2} = \\frac{1}{8} \\]\n\nSo, Sally eats 1/8 of a pizza.\n\nNext, Sally shares 1/10 of the pizza with her friend. This 1/10 is a portion of the entire pizza, not just the 1/2 she initially had. Therefore, she gives away 1/10 of a pizza.\n\nNow, we need to calculate how much pizza Sally has left. She started with 1/2 of a pizza, ate 1/8 of it, and shared 1/10 of the whole pizza. We need to subtract both the amount she ate and the amount she shared from the initial 1/2 pizza.\n\nFirst, let's convert 1/2 to a common denominator with 1/8 and 1/10 to make subtraction easier. The least common multiple of 2, 8, and 10 is 40. So, we convert each fraction:\n\n- 1/2 is equivalent to 20/40.\n- 1/8 is equivalent to 5/40.\n- 1/10 is equivalent to 4/40.\n\nNow, subtract the fractions:\n\n1.

In the context of real analysis, a function is said to be integrable if we can compute its Riemann integral over the specified interval. The Riemann integral is a way of assigning a number to the area under the curve of the function on that interval. This number is what we refer to as the integral of the function.\n\nNow, since \\( f \\) is a function from a vector space \\( V \\) to the real numbers \\(\\mathbb{R}\\), and it is integrable over \\([a, b]\\), the integral of \\( f \\) over this interval is defined as:\n\n\\[\n\\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx\n\\]\n\nThis integral is computed by taking the limit of sums of the form:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^n f(x_i^*) \\Delta x_i\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\Delta x_i\\) are small subintervals of \\([a, b]\\), and \\(x_i^*\\) are sample points in these subintervals. As the number of subintervals \\( n \\) increases and their width \\(\\Delta x_i\\) decreases, this sum approaches the integral.\n\nThe result of this integration process is a single real number, which represents the total \"accumulated value\" of the function \\( f \\) over the interval \\([a, b]\\). This is because the Riemann integral is specifically designed to produce a scalar value that quantifies the area under the curve of the function.\n\nTherefore, since the integral of \\( f \\) over \\([a, b]\\) is computed as a limit of sums of real numbers, the result is itself a real number. This aligns with the definition of a scalar in the context of real numbers, which is simply an element of \\(\\mathbb{R}\\).\n\nIn conclusion, the integral of an integrable function \\( f: V \\to \\mathbb{R} \\) over an interval \\([a, b]\\) is indeed a scalar in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\), as it results in a single real number that represents the accumulated value of the function over that interval.\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  f t\nargument\n  t\nhas type\n  \u211d : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  V : Type\napplication type mismatch\n  f t\nargument\n  t\nhas type\n  \u211d : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  V : Type\nunknown identifier 'begin'\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

The limit of a function \\( f(x) \\) as \\( x \\) approaches a certain value \\( a \\) is the value that \\( f(x) \\) gets closer to as \\( x \\) gets closer to \\( a \\). In this case, we want to find the limit of \\( f(x) = 3x + 2 \\) as \\( x \\) approaches 4.\n\nFor linear functions, which are functions of the form \\( f(x) = mx + b \\), finding the limit as \\( x \\) approaches a specific value is straightforward. This is because linear functions are continuous everywhere, meaning there are no jumps, holes, or asymptotes in their graphs. The value of the function at any point is simply the value it approaches as \\( x \\) gets closer to that point.\n\nTo find the limit of \\( f(x) = 3x + 2 \\) as \\( x \\) approaches 4, we can directly substitute \\( x = 4 \\) into the function. This is because, for continuous functions, the limit as \\( x \\) approaches a point is simply the function's value at that point.\n\nLet's calculate it:\n\n1. Substitute \\( x = 4 \\) into the function: \n   \\[\n   f(4) = 3(4) + 2\n   \\]\n\n2. Perform the multiplication:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 4 = 12\n   \\]\n\n3.

The key word here is \"equally,\" which means each friend should receive the same number of apples.\n\n2. **Setting Up the Division**: We need to divide the total number of apples, which is 20, by the number of friends, which is 5. Mathematically, this is expressed as \\( 20 \\div 5 \\).\n\n3. **Performing the Division**: When we divide 20 by 5, we are essentially asking, \"How many groups of 5 can we make out of 20?\" \n\n   - We start by seeing how many times 5 fits into 20. \n   - We know that 5 fits into 20 exactly 4 times because \\( 5 \\times 4 = 20 \\).\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since 5 fits into 20 exactly 4 times without any remainder, each friend will receive 4 apples.

Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, we are given the dimensions of the entire garden. The garden is a rectangle with a length of 8 meters and a width of 6 meters. To find the total area of the garden, we use the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is the product of its length and width.

The formula that connects these three quantities is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Mass} = \\text{Density} \\times \\text{Volume} \\]\n\nFirst, let's determine the volume of the cube. A cube is a three-dimensional shape with all sides of equal length. The formula for the volume of a cube is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Volume} = \\text{side length}^3 \\]\n\nIn this problem, the side length of the cube is given as 5 cm. So, we calculate the volume as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Volume} = 5 \\, \\text{cm} \\times 5 \\, \\text{cm} \\times 5 \\, \\text{cm} = 125 \\, \\text{cm}^3 \\]\n\nNext, we use the given density of the substance, which is 2 g/cm\u00b3. The density tells us how much mass is contained in a unit volume of the substance. In this case, it means that every cubic centimeter of the substance has a mass of 2 grams.\n\nNow, we can calculate the mass of the cube by multiplying its volume by the density:\n\n\\[ \\text{Mass} = 2 \\, \\text{g/cm}^3 \\times 125 \\, \\text{cm}^3 = 250 \\, \\text{g} \\]\n\nTherefore, the mass of the cube is 250 grams. This calculation shows that by knowing the side length of the cube and the density of the material, we can easily find the mass using the formula for mass.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

An integer is even if it can be expressed as \\( a = 2k \\) for some integer \\( k \\). This definition is crucial because it directly relates the integer to a multiple of 2.\n\nNow, let's consider the square of an even integer. If \\( a \\) is even, then by definition, \\( a = 2k \\) for some integer \\( k \\). To find \\( a^2 \\), we simply square both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ a^2 = (2k)^2. \\]\n\nWhen we expand this expression, we get:\n\n\\[ a^2 = 4k^2. \\]\n\nNotice that \\( 4k^2 \\) can be rewritten as \\( 2 \\times (2k^2) \\). Here, \\( 2k^2 \\) is clearly an integer because it is the product of integers \\( 2 \\) and \\( k^2 \\). Therefore, \\( a^2 = 4k^2 \\) is a multiple of 2, which means \\( a^2 \\) is even.\n\nThis reasoning shows that if \\( a \\) is even, then \\( a^2 \\) is also even because squaring an even number results in a number that is still a multiple of 2.

The mean, often referred to as the average, is calculated by adding up all the values in the data set and then dividing by the number of values. \n\nThe data set provided is: 12, 15, 11, 14, 13, 15, 12.\n\n1. Add all the values together:\n   \\[\n   12 + 15 + 11 + 14 + 13 + 15 + 12 = 92\n   \\]\n\n2. Count the number of values in the data set. There are 7 values.\n\n3.

The median is the middle value when the data set is ordered from smallest to largest. If there is an odd number of values, the median is the middle one. If there is an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values.\n\n1. First, order the data set from smallest to largest:\n   \\[\n   11, 12, 12, 13, 14, 15, 15\n   \\]\n\n2. Since there are 7 values (an odd number), the median is the middle value. The middle value is the 4th value in this ordered list.\n\n3. Identify the 4th value:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Median} = 13\n   \\]\n\nThus, the median of the data set is 13.\n\nIn summary, for the given data set of 7 values, the mean is approximately 13.14, and the median is 13.

We are given that the ratio of boys to girls is 3:2.\n\nFirst, let's understand what a ratio of 3:2 means. It tells us that for every 3 boys, there are 2 girls. This ratio can be thought of as a way to divide the total number of students into parts. Specifically, the total number of students can be divided into 3 parts for boys and 2 parts for girls, making a total of 3 + 2 = 5 equal parts.\n\nNow, if the total number of students is \"x\", we can divide \"x\" into these 5 equal parts. Each part will then represent the same number of students. To find out how many students are in each part, we divide the total number of students by the total number of parts:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of students in each part} = \\frac{x}{5} \\]\n\nSince the boys take up 3 parts, the number of boys in the classroom is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of boys} = 3 \\times \\frac{x}{5} = \\frac{3x}{5} \\]\n\nSimilarly, since the girls take up 2 parts, the number of girls in the classroom is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of girls} = 2 \\times \\frac{x}{5} = \\frac{2x}{5} \\]\n\nThus, we have expressed the number of boys and girls in terms of the total number of students \"x\".

A real vector space is a set equipped with two operations: vector addition and scalar multiplication, which satisfy certain axioms. One of these axioms is the distributive property of scalar multiplication over vector addition, which is exactly what we need to prove.\n\nThe expression \\( c \\cdot (\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{b}) \\) involves two operations: first, we add the vectors \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{b}\\), and then we multiply the resulting vector by the scalar \\(c\\). According to the definition of vector addition, \\(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{b}\\) is another vector in the same vector space \\(V\\).\n\nNow, let's consider the right-hand side of the equation, \\( c \\cdot \\mathbf{a} + c \\cdot \\mathbf{b} \\). Here, we first multiply each vector \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) by the scalar \\(c\\) separately, and then we add the resulting vectors.\n\nThe distributive property of scalar multiplication over vector addition in a vector space states that multiplying a sum of vectors by a scalar is the same as multiplying each vector by the scalar and then adding the results.

This means that in the second month, the profit will be $1000 - $200 = $800.\n\n3. **Pattern Recognition**: We can see that the profit forms an arithmetic sequence where each term decreases by $200 from the previous term.

Therefore, the original area of the garden is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Original Area} = 12 \\times 7 = 84 \\text{ square units} \\]\n\nThe perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding together twice the length and twice the width. Thus, the original perimeter is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Original Perimeter} = 2 \\times (12 + 7) = 2 \\times 19 = 38 \\text{ units} \\]\n\nNow, the gardener decides to extend the length by 5 units and reduce the width by 2 units. This means the new length of the garden will be:\n\n\\[ \\text{New Length} = 12 + 5 = 17 \\text{ units} \\]\n\nAnd the new width will be:\n\n\\[ \\text{New Width} = 7 - 2 = 5 \\text{ units} \\]\n\nWith these new dimensions, we can calculate the new area of the garden.

In the context of linear regression, a residual for a given observation is the difference between the observed value (yi) and the predicted value (y\u0302i) from the regression model. Mathematically, the residual for the i-th observation is given by (yi - y\u0302i).\n\nThe predicted value y\u0302i for each xi in a simple linear regression model is calculated using the equation y\u0302i = \u03b20 + \u03b21xi. Here, \u03b20 is the y-intercept, and \u03b21 is the slope of the regression line. The goal of linear regression is to find the values of \u03b20 and \u03b21 that minimize the sum of the squared residuals, which is a common method known as the least squares method.\n\nNow, let's consider the sum of the residuals for all observations:\n\nSum of residuals = \u03a3(yi - y\u0302i) for i = 1 to 10.\n\nSubstituting the expression for y\u0302i, we have:\n\nSum of residuals = \u03a3(yi - (\u03b20 + \u03b21xi)) for i = 1 to 10.\n\nThis can be rewritten as:\n\nSum of residuals = \u03a3(yi) - \u03a3(\u03b20 + \u03b21xi) for i = 1 to 10.\n\nBreaking it down further, we get:\n\nSum of residuals = \u03a3(yi) - \u03a3(\u03b20) - \u03a3(\u03b21xi) for i = 1 to 10.\n\nSince \u03b20 and \u03b21 are constants, we can factor them out of the summation:\n\nSum of residuals = \u03a3(yi) - 10\u03b20 - \u03b21\u03a3(xi).\n\nThe key insight here is that the least squares method, which is used to determine \u03b20 and \u03b21, ensures that the sum of the residuals is zero. This is because one of the conditions for the least squares estimates is that the sum of the residuals must be zero. This condition arises from the fact that the least squares method minimizes the sum of squared residuals, and one of the necessary conditions for this minimization is that the derivative of the sum of squared residuals with respect to \u03b20 is zero. This derivative condition leads directly to the requirement that the sum of the residuals is zero.\n\nTherefore, by the properties of the least squares method used in linear regression, we conclude that:\n\n\u03a3(yi - y\u0302i) = 0.\n\nThus, the sum of the residuals for all observations in a simple linear regression model is indeed zero.\nPrevious attempt failed with: type expected, got\n  (\u03b5 i : \u211d)\nexpected token\n'residual' has already been declared\napplication type mismatch\n  @residual i\nargument\n  i\nhas type\n  \u2115 : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  Type ?u.250 : Type (?u.250 + 1)\nPlease revise the proof.",

Now, consider the given right triangle. We know that the sum of the angles in any triangle is always 180 degrees. In this triangle, we have two angles that are each 45 degrees. Therefore, the third angle must be 90 degrees because 45 + 45 + 90 = 180 degrees. This confirms that the triangle is a right triangle.\n\nNext, let's focus on the two angles that are each 45 degrees. According to the theorem mentioned in the context, if a triangle has two equal angles, the sides opposite those angles are also equal. In our triangle, the two 45-degree angles are equal, so the sides opposite these angles must be equal as well.\n\nSince the two sides opposite the 45-degree angles are equal, the triangle satisfies the definition of an isosceles triangle, which requires at least two sides to be of equal length. Therefore, the right triangle with angles of 45 degrees, 45 degrees, and 90 degrees is indeed an isosceles triangle.\n\nIn summary, by recognizing the equal angles and applying the theorem that states equal angles in a triangle imply equal opposite sides, we conclude that the given right triangle is isosceles.",

Therefore, the area of the corn section is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Area of corn} = 35 \\times 25 = 875 \\text{ square units} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the area of the wheat section.

Thus, the area of the wheat section is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Area of wheat} = 30 \\times 20 = 600 \\text{ square units} \\]\n\nNow, to find the total area of the field used by Farmer Bob, we simply add the areas of the corn and wheat sections together:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total area} = \\text{Area of corn} + \\text{Area of wheat} = 875 + 600 = 1475 \\text{ square units} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total area of the rectangular field used by Farmer Bob is 1475 square units.

So, after this transformation, the side length of the square becomes `3x` inches.\n\nNext, the square undergoes a second transformation that reduces its size by half. Reducing the size by half means dividing the side length by 2. Therefore, the side length after this transformation becomes `(3x) / 2` inches.\n\nWe are given that after both transformations, the final side length of the square is 6 inches. So, we set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3x}{2} = 6\n\\]\n\nTo solve for `x`, we need to eliminate the fraction.

This is because the truth of the implication \"p implies q\" means that whenever p is true, q must also be true. Therefore, if q is not true, p cannot be true either, otherwise, it would contradict the original implication.\n\nLet's break down the proof into two parts: the forward implication and the reverse implication.\n\n### Forward Implication:\nWe want to show that if \"p implies q\" is true, then \"not q implies not p\" is also true.\n\n1. **Assume** that \"p implies q\" is true. This means that whenever p is true, q must also be true.\n2. **Assume** that \"not q\" is true. This means q is false.\n3. Since \"p implies q\" is true, and q is false, p cannot be true.

This means that whenever q is false, p must also be false.\n2. **Assume** that p is true. We need to show that q must also be true.\n3. If q were false, then by our assumption \"not q implies not p\", p would also have to be false. But this contradicts our assumption that p is true.\n4. Therefore, q cannot be false, which means q must be true.\n5. We have shown that if p is true, then q must also be true, which is exactly what \"p implies q\" states.\n\nBy proving both the forward and reverse implications, we have demonstrated the Rule of Transposition: \"p implies q\" if and only if \"not q implies not p\".

The integral \\(\\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx = 0\\) implies that the \"net area\" between the graph of \\( f \\) and the x-axis over the interval \\([a, b]\\) is zero. This means that the positive and negative areas cancel each other out perfectly.\n\nNow, consider the properties of continuous functions. A key property is the Intermediate Value Theorem, which states that if a function is continuous on a closed interval \\([a, b]\\) and takes on two values \\( f(a) \\) and \\( f(b) \\), then it must take on every value between \\( f(a) \\) and \\( f(b) \\) at some point within the interval.\n\nSuppose, for the sake of contradiction, that \\( f(x) \\neq 0 \\) for all \\( x \\) in \\([a, b]\\). This would mean that \\( f(x) \\) is either always positive or always negative throughout the interval. If \\( f(x) \\) were always positive, then the integral \\(\\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx\\) would be positive, as we would be summing positive values over a positive length interval. Similarly, if \\( f(x) \\) were always negative, the integral would be negative. In either case, the integral could not be zero, contradicting our initial condition.\n\nTherefore, the assumption that \\( f(x) \\neq 0 \\) for all \\( x \\) in \\([a, b]\\) must be false. This means there must be at least one point \\( c \\) in \\([a, b]\\) where \\( f(c) = 0\\).\n\nThus, we conclude that if the integral of a continuous function over an interval is zero, there must exist some point within that interval where the function itself is zero.\nPrevious attempt failed with: function expected at\n  Icc\nterm has type\n  ?m.386\nfunction expected at\n  Icc\nterm has type\n  ?m.386\nfunction expected at\n  Icc\nterm has type\n  x\u271d\nunsolved goals\nx\u271d : Sort u_1\nIcc : x\u271d\nf : \u211d \u2192 \u211d\na b : \u211d\nhab : a < b\nhf : ContinuousOn f (sorryAx (Set \u211d) true)\nh_int : \u222b (x : \u211d) in a..b, f x = 0\n\u22a2 \u2203 c \u2208 ?m.2720 f a b hab hf h_int c, f c = 0\nPlease revise the proof.",

We are given that there are 5 red balls in the jar. Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes is 5.\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of possible outcomes, which is the total number of balls in the jar. The jar contains 5 red balls, 3 blue balls, and 2 green balls. To find the total number of balls, we simply add these numbers together:\n\n5 (red balls) + 3 (blue balls) + 2 (green balls) = 10 balls in total.\n\nNow, we can calculate the probability of drawing a red ball by dividing the number of red balls by the total number of balls:\n\nProbability of drawing a red ball = Number of red balls / Total number of balls = 5 / 10.\n\nSimplifying this fraction gives us 1/2.\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing a red ball from the jar is 1/2, or 50%.

This involves comparing the sample means to the population means using the standard deviations provided.\n\nFirst, let's consider the real parts of the complex numbers. The population mean of the real parts is 5, and the sample mean is 4.8. The standard deviation of the real parts in the sample is 1, and the sample size is 30. We will use a t-test for this comparison because the sample size is relatively small, and we assume the population standard deviation is unknown.\n\nThe null hypothesis (\\(H_0\\)) is that the sample mean of the real parts is equal to the population mean, i.e., \\( \\mu = 5 \\). The alternative hypothesis (\\(H_a\\)) is that the sample mean is not equal to the population mean, i.e., \\( \\mu \\neq 5 \\).\n\nTo perform the t-test, we calculate the t-statistic using the formula:\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{\\bar{x} - \\mu}{s / \\sqrt{n}} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( \\bar{x} = 4.8 \\) is the sample mean,\n- \\( \\mu = 5 \\) is the population mean,\n- \\( s = 1 \\) is the sample standard deviation,\n- \\( n = 30 \\) is the sample size.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{4.8 - 5}{1 / \\sqrt{30}} = \\frac{-0.2}{1 / \\sqrt{30}} \\approx -1.095 \\]\n\nNext, we compare this t-statistic to the critical t-value from the t-distribution table for 29 degrees of freedom (since \\( n - 1 = 29 \\)) at the 5% significance level for a two-tailed test. The critical t-value is approximately \u00b12.045.\n\nSince the calculated t-statistic of -1.095 is within the range of -2.045 to 2.045, we fail to reject the null hypothesis for the real parts. This means there is no significant difference between the sample mean and the population mean for the real parts at the 5% significance level.\n\nNow, let's consider the imaginary parts. The population mean of the imaginary parts is 3, and the sample mean is 2.9. The standard deviation of the imaginary parts in the sample is 0.8.\n\nWe perform a similar t-test for the imaginary parts:\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{\\bar{y} - \\mu}{s / \\sqrt{n}} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( \\bar{y} = 2.9 \\) is the sample mean,\n- \\( \\mu = 3 \\) is the population mean,\n- \\( s = 0.8 \\) is the sample standard deviation,\n- \\( n = 30 \\) is the sample size.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{2.9 - 3}{0.8 / \\sqrt{30}} = \\frac{-0.1}{0.8 / \\sqrt{30}} \\approx -0.684 \\]\n\nAgain, we compare this t-statistic to the critical t-value of \u00b12.045. Since -0.684 is within the range of -2.045 to 2.045, we fail to reject the null hypothesis for the imaginary parts as well.\n\nIn conclusion, for both the real and imaginary parts, the sample means are not significantly different from the population means at the 5% level of significance. Therefore, the sample is not significantly different from the population.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  HasEquiv \u211d\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  HasEquiv \u211d\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nPlease revise the proof.",

This means the diameter of the sphere is equal to the smallest side of the parallelepiped, because the sphere must fit entirely within the parallelepiped and touch all its faces.\n\nLet's assume, without loss of generality, that \\( a \\leq b \\leq c \\). Therefore, the diameter of the sphere is \\( a \\), and the radius \\( r \\) of the sphere is half of the diameter:\n\n\\[ r = \\frac{a}{2}. \\]\n\nThe surface area \\( S \\) of a sphere is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ S = 4\\pi r^2. \\]\n\nSubstituting the expression for the radius, we have:\n\n\\[ S = 4\\pi \\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right)^2 = 4\\pi \\frac{a^2}{4} = \\pi a^2. \\]\n\nNow, we have expressions for both the volume \\( V \\) and the surface area \\( S \\):\n\n- Volume of the parallelepiped: \\( V = abc \\).\n- Surface area of the sphere: \\( S = \\pi a^2 \\).\n\nFinally, we find the ratio \\( V/S \\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{V}{S} = \\frac{abc}{\\pi a^2}. \\]\n\nSimplifying this expression, we cancel one \\( a \\) from the numerator and the denominator:\n\n\\[ \\frac{V}{S} = \\frac{bc}{\\pi a}. \\]\n\nThus, the value of \\( V/S \\) in terms of \\( a \\), \\( b \\), \\( c \\), and \\( \\pi \\) is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{bc}{\\pi a}. \\]\n\nThis result makes intuitive sense because the volume of the parallelepiped depends on all three dimensions, while the surface area of the sphere is determined by the smallest dimension, which is the diameter of the sphere.\nPrevious attempt failed with: ambiguous, possible interpretations \n  \u03c0 : \u2115 \u2192 \u2115\n  \n  \u03c0 : \u211d\nambiguous, possible interpretations \n  \u03c0 : \u2115 \u2192 \u2115\n  \n  \u03c0 : \u211d\nambiguous, possible interpretations \n  \u03c0 : \u2115 \u2192 \u2115\n  \n  \u03c0 : \u211d\nunsolved goals\na b c : \u211d\nV : \u211d := a * b * c\nS : \u211d := sorryAx \u211d true * a ^ 2\n\u22a2 a * b * c * a\u207b\u00b9 ^ 2 * (sorryAx \u211d true)\u207b\u00b9 = b * c * (sorryAx \u211d true)\u207b\u00b9\nPlease revise the proof.",

The formula for the area of a circle is given by:\n\n\\[ \\text{Area of a circle} = \\pi \\times r^2 \\]\n\nwhere \\( r \\) is the radius of the circle. In this case, the radius \\( r \\) is 4 units.

        "informal_proof": "# Informal Proof:\n\nTo prove that the Laplace transform of a continuous function is also continuous, let's first understand what the Laplace transform does. The Laplace transform, denoted as \\(\\laptrans{f}(s)\\), takes a function \\(f(t)\\) defined for \\(t \\geq 0\\) and transforms it into a function of a complex variable \\(s\\). The transform is given by the integral:\n\n\\[\n\\laptrans{f}(s) = \\int_0^{\\infty} f(t) e^{-st} \\, dt\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(s\\) is a complex number, typically written as \\(s = \\sigma + i\\omega\\).\n\nNow, let's consider the properties of the function \\(f(t)\\) and the integral involved in the Laplace transform:\n\n1. **Continuity of \\(f(t)\\):** We are given that \\(f(t)\\) is continuous for \\(t \\geq 0\\). This means that for any point \\(t_0\\) in the domain, the function values \\(f(t)\\) approach \\(f(t_0)\\) as \\(t\\) approaches \\(t_0\\).\n\n2. **Exponential Decay:** The term \\(e^{-st}\\) in the integral introduces an exponential decay factor. For the real part of \\(s\\), \\(\\sigma > 0\\), this decay ensures that the integral converges, as the exponential term diminishes the contribution of \\(f(t)\\) for large \\(t\\).\n\n3. **Continuity of the Integral:** The integral of a continuous function over a finite or infinite interval is continuous with respect to parameters that appear in the integrand. In our case, the parameter is \\(s\\). The continuity of the integral with respect to \\(s\\) follows from the Dominated Convergence Theorem, which allows us to interchange limits and integrals under certain conditions. Here, the exponential decay ensures that the integral is dominated by an integrable function, allowing us to apply this theorem.\n\n4. **Dependence on \\(s\\):** The Laplace transform \\(\\laptrans{f}(s)\\) depends continuously on \\(s\\) because small changes in \\(s\\) result in small changes in the value of the integral. This is due to the continuity of both \\(f(t)\\) and the exponential function \\(e^{-st}\\).\n\n5. **Conclusion:** Since the integral of a continuous function with respect to a parameter is continuous, and since the exponential decay ensures convergence, the Laplace transform \\(\\laptrans{f}(s)\\) is continuous with respect to \\(s\\).\n\nThus, we have shown that the Laplace transform of a continuous function is itself continuous. This conclusion relies on the properties of continuous functions, the nature of the exponential decay in the Laplace transform, and the application of the Dominated Convergence Theorem to ensure the continuity of the integral with respect to \\(s\\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: invalid field notation, type is not of the form (C ...) where C is a constant\n  set\nhas type\n  ?m.242 \u2192 ?m.243 PUnit.{?u.241 + 1}\ntype mismatch\n  -s * \u2191t\nhas type\n  \u2102 : outParam Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u211d : Type\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.measureSpace', and it does not have executable code\nunknown identifier 'continuous_of_continuous_on_of_isCompact'\nPlease revise the proof.",

This rule is often expressed in logical terms as: from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), we can deduce \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\).\n\nTo understand why this is true, let's break it down:\n\n1. **Understanding the Implication \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\):**\n   - The statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) means that whenever \\( P \\) is true, \\( Q \\) must also be true. If \\( P \\) happens, then \\( Q \\) follows.\n\n2. **Considering the Contrapositive \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\):**\n   - The contrapositive of an implication is a logically equivalent statement.

This completes the proof of the Rule of Transposition.\n\nIn summary, the Rule of Transposition is a fundamental logical principle that relies on the equivalence between an implication and its contrapositive.

Specifically, we are given two integers, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and we want to prove that if \\(a\\) is more than \\(b\\), then the difference \\(a - b\\) is greater than 0, and conversely, \\(b - a\\) is less than 0.\n\nLet's break this down step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Statement \\(a > b\\):** \n   - When we say \\(a\\) is more than \\(b\\), we are using the strict inequality \\(a > b\\). This means that \\(a\\) is not equal to \\(b\\) and is also not less than \\(b\\). In other words, \\(a\\) is strictly greater than \\(b\\).\n\n2. **Translating \\(a > b\\) to a Difference:**\n   - The statement \\(a > b\\) can be rewritten in terms of a difference: \\(a - b > 0\\). This is because if you subtract a smaller number (\\(b\\)) from a larger number (\\(a\\)), the result is a positive number. Thus, \\(a - b\\) being greater than 0 directly captures the idea that \\(a\\) is more than \\(b\\).\n\n3. **Considering the Reverse Difference \\(b - a\\):**\n   - Now, let's consider the reverse difference, \\(b - a\\). If \\(a > b\\), then naturally, \\(b\\) is less than \\(a\\). Subtracting a larger number (\\(a\\)) from a smaller number (\\(b\\)) results in a negative number. Therefore, \\(b - a < 0\\).\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - We have shown that if \\(a > b\\), then \\(a - b > 0\\) because subtracting a smaller number from a larger one yields a positive result. Similarly, \\(b - a < 0\\) because subtracting a larger number from a smaller one yields a negative result. These two statements are just different ways of expressing the same relationship between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\nIn summary, the problem is essentially about understanding the implications of the inequality \\(a > b\\) in terms of differences. The positive difference \\(a - b\\) and the negative difference \\(b - a\\) are two sides of the same coin, both reflecting the fact that \\(a\\) is indeed greater than \\(b\\).",

This is because the partial derivatives represent the rate of change of the function in the directions of the \\( x \\)-axis and \\( y \\)-axis, respectively. If both of these rates of change are zero, it suggests that the function is not increasing or decreasing in any small neighborhood around the point \\( (a, b) \\).\n\nTo understand why this implies a local extremum, consider the following reasoning:\n\n1. **Stationary Point**: The point \\( (a, b) \\) is a stationary point because the partial derivatives are zero. This means that, at least in the immediate vicinity of \\( (a, b) \\), the function does not have a linear increase or decrease in either the \\( x \\) or \\( y \\) direction.\n\n2. **Second Derivative Test**: In one dimension, we often use the second derivative test to determine the nature of a stationary point. Similarly, in two dimensions, we can use the second derivative test, which involves the Hessian matrix, to determine whether the stationary point is a local minimum, local maximum, or a saddle point.\n\n3. **Local Behavior**: If the Hessian matrix at \\( (a, b) \\) is positive definite, the function has a local minimum at \\( (a, b) \\). If it is negative definite, the function has a local maximum. If the Hessian is indefinite, the point is a saddle point, which is not a local extremum.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Given that the partial derivatives are zero, \\( (a, b) \\) is a candidate for a local extremum. The actual nature of the extremum (minimum, maximum, or saddle point) depends on the second derivatives, which are encapsulated in the Hessian matrix. However, the zero partial derivatives are a necessary condition for a local extremum.\n\nThus, the condition that both partial derivatives are zero at \\( (a, b) \\) suggests that \\( f \\) has a local extremum at that point, pending further analysis of the second derivatives to confirm the type of extremum.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unexpected token '\u2202'; expected term\nunexpected token '\u2202'; expected term\nexpected token\nPlease revise the proof.",

By definition, a negative number is any real number that is less than zero. So, both \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are less than zero.\n\nThe key to understanding why the product of two negative numbers is positive lies in the properties of real numbers and how they form a mathematical structure known as a ring. A ring is a set equipped with two operations, typically addition and multiplication, that satisfy certain properties. The set of real numbers, \\(\\R\\), forms a ring under these operations.\n\nOne important property of rings is how multiplication interacts with negatives. Specifically, in any ring, the product of two negative elements is equal to the product of their positive counterparts. This is captured by the theorem \"Product of Ring Negatives,\" which states that for any elements \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) in a ring, the product of their negatives, \\((-x) \\times (-y)\\), is equal to the product of the elements themselves, \\( x \\times y \\).\n\nApplying this to our negative numbers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), we can express them as \\( a = -x \\) and \\( b = -y \\), where \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are positive real numbers (since the negative of a negative number is positive). According to the theorem, the product \\( a \\times b = (-x) \\times (-y) \\) is equal to \\( x \\times y \\).\n\nSince \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are positive, their product \\( x \\times y \\) is also positive. Therefore, the product of the two negative numbers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) is positive.\n\nIn summary, the product of two negative numbers is positive because the structure of real numbers as a ring ensures that multiplying two negatives results in a positive, as demonstrated by the properties of ring multiplication.",

The garden has a length of 6 meters and a width of 4 meters. The area of a rectangle is found by multiplying its length by its width. Therefore, the area of the garden is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Area of the garden} = 6 \\times 4 = 24 \\text{ square meters} \\]\n\nNext, we need to consider the path that surrounds the garden. The path is 1 meter wide and runs around the entire perimeter of the garden. This means the path adds 1 meter to each side of the garden's length and width.\n\nTo find the dimensions of the entire structure (garden plus path), we add 2 meters to both the length and the width of the garden (1 meter on each side). Thus, the new dimensions are:\n\n- New length = 6 + 2 = 8 meters\n- New width = 4 + 2 = 6 meters\n\nNow, we calculate the area of the entire structure, which includes both the garden and the path. Again, using the formula for the area of a rectangle:\n\n\\[ \\text{Area of the entire structure} = 8 \\times 6 = 48 \\text{ square meters} \\]\n\nThe next step is to find the fraction of the total area that is occupied by the garden. We do this by dividing the area of the garden by the area of the entire structure:\n\n\\[ \\text{Fraction of area occupied by the garden} = \\frac{\\text{Area of the garden}}{\\text{Area of the entire structure}} = \\frac{24}{48} \\]\n\nSimplifying this fraction gives:\n\n\\[ \\frac{24}{48} = \\frac{1}{2} \\]\n\nTherefore, the garden occupies \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) or one-half of the total area of the new structure.

To find out how much money she has saved after 12 weeks, we multiply her weekly allowance by the number of weeks she saves:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total savings} = 5 \\text{ dollars/week} \\times 12 \\text{ weeks} = 60 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nAlice initially planned to buy a toy that costs $60, which is exactly the amount she saved. However, she finds the same toy on sale for $40. This means she can buy the toy for less than she originally expected.\n\nNow, let's calculate how much money Alice has left after purchasing the toy on sale. She spends $40 on the toy, so we subtract this amount from her total savings:\n\n\\[ \\text{Money left} = 60 \\text{ dollars} - 40 \\text{ dollars} = 20 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, after buying the toy on sale, Alice has $20 left. This is the amount of money she has remaining after her purchase.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unsolved goals\nh_total_savings : total_savings = 60\n\u22a2 60 - sale_toy_cost = 60 - 40\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "# Informal Proof:\n\nTo understand why the median of a set of numbers, when the set size \\( n \\) is even, is the average of the \\((n/2)\\)th and \\((n/2 + 1)\\)th numbers, let's first clarify what a median is. The median is a measure of central tendency that represents the middle value of a data set when the numbers are arranged in order. For an odd number of elements, the median is simply the middle number. However, for an even number of elements, there is no single middle number, so we take the average of the two middle numbers.\n\nLet's break this down step by step:\n\n1. **Arrange the Numbers**: First, we arrange the numbers in ascending order. This step is crucial because the median is defined based on the order of the numbers.\n\n2. **Identify the Middle Position**: For a set with an even number of elements \\( n \\), the middle of the set is not a single position but rather falls between two positions. Specifically, these positions are the \\((n/2)\\)th and \\((n/2 + 1)\\)th positions. This is because if you divide the set into two equal halves, the first half ends at the \\((n/2)\\)th position, and the second half starts at the \\((n/2 + 1)\\)th position.\n\n3. **Calculate the Median**: Since there is no single middle number, the median is defined as the average of the numbers at these two positions. This means you take the number at the \\((n/2)\\)th position and the number at the \\((n/2 + 1)\\)th position, add them together, and divide by 2. This average gives you a value that represents the center of the data set.\n\n4. **Why This Works**: The reason this method works is that it effectively balances the data set around a central value. By averaging the two middle numbers, you ensure that the median reflects the central tendency of the data, even when there is no single middle number.\n\nIn summary, for an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two central numbers because this method provides a balanced representation of the data's center. This approach is consistent with the definition of the median as the value that divides the data set into two equal halves.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  ?m.898 / ?m.899\nn : \u2115\nhn : n % 2 = 0\na : Fin n \u2192 \u2115\nh_sorted : List.Sorted (fun x x_1 => x \u2264 x_1) (List.ofFn a)\nsorted_list : List \u2115 := List.ofFn a\nmid1 : \u2115 := n / 2\nmid2 : \u2115 := mid1 + 1\n\u22a2 mid1 - 1 < n\ntype mismatch\n  h_mid1\nhas type\n  mid1 - 1 < n : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  mid1 - 1 < sorted_list.length : Prop\ntype mismatch\n  lt_succ_self mid1\nhas type\n  mid1 < mid1.succ : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  mid1 < n : Prop\ntype mismatch\n  h_mid2\nhas type\n  mid2 - 1 < n : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  mid2 - 1 < sorted_list.length : Prop\nunknown identifier 'mid1'\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  ?m.1110 / ?m.1111\nn : \u2115\nhn : n % 2 = 0\na : Fin n \u2192 \u2115\nh_sorted : List.Sorted (fun x x_1 => x \u2264 x_1) (List.ofFn a)\nsorted_list\u271d : List \u2115 := List.ofFn a\nmid1\u271d : \u2115 := n / 2\nmid2\u271d : \u2115 := mid1\u271d + 1\n\u22a2 sorryAx \u2115 true - 1 < n\nunknown identifier 'mid2'\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  ?n + ?m - ?m\nn : \u2115\nhn : n % 2 = 0\na : Fin n \u2192 \u2115\nh_sorted : List.Sorted (fun x x_1 => x \u2264 x_1) (List.ofFn a)\nsorted_list\u271d : List \u2115 := List.ofFn a\nmid1\u271d : \u2115 := n / 2\nmid2\u271d : \u2115 := mid1\u271d + 1\nh_mid1 : sorryAx \u2115 true - 1 < n\n\u22a2 sorryAx \u2115 true - 1 < n\nsimp made no progress\nPlease revise the proof.",

This is a linear second-order homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients.\n\nThe characteristic equation for this differential equation is obtained by assuming a solution of the form \\( y = e^{rx} \\), which gives us the characteristic equation:\n\n\\[ r^2 - 1 = 0. \\]\n\nSolving this, we find the roots \\( r = 1 \\) and \\( r = -1 \\). These roots indicate that the general solution of the differential equation is:\n\n\\[ y(x) = C_1 e^x + C_2 e^{-x}, \\]\n\nwhere \\( C_1 \\) and \\( C_2 \\) are constants to be determined by the initial conditions.\n\nNow, we apply the initial conditions to find these constants. First, using \\( y(0) = 1 \\):\n\n\\[ y(0) = C_1 e^0 + C_2 e^0 = C_1 + C_2 = 1. \\]\n\nNext, we use the condition \\( y'(0) = 0 \\). First, we differentiate the general solution:\n\n\\[ y'(x) = C_1 e^x - C_2 e^{-x}. \\]\n\nApplying the initial condition:\n\n\\[ y'(0) = C_1 e^0 - C_2 e^0 = C_1 - C_2 = 0. \\]\n\nNow we have a system of two equations:\n\n1. \\( C_1 + C_2 = 1 \\)\n2. \\( C_1 - C_2 = 0 \\)\n\nSolving this system, we add the two equations to eliminate \\( C_2 \\):\n\n\\[ 2C_1 = 1 \\Rightarrow C_1 = \\frac{1}{2}. \\]\n\nSubstituting \\( C_1 = \\frac{1}{2} \\) into the first equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2} + C_2 = 1 \\Rightarrow C_2 = \\frac{1}{2}. \\]\n\nThus, the particular solution satisfying the initial conditions is:\n\n\\[ y(x) = \\frac{1}{2} e^x + \\frac{1}{2} e^{-x}. \\]\n\nNow, we need to express this solution in the alternate coordinate system defined by the vectors \\( v_1 = (1,0) \\) and \\( v_2 = (0,1) \\). In this context, the solution \\( y(x) \\) can be seen as a linear combination of the basis functions \\( e^x \\) and \\( e^{-x} \\), which correspond to the basis vectors \\( v_1 \\) and \\( v_2 \\) in the new coordinate system.\n\nTherefore, the solution in the new coordinate system is simply the coefficients of \\( e^x \\) and \\( e^{-x} \\) in the expression for \\( y(x) \\), which are \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) and \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\), respectively. Thus, the solution in the new coordinate system is:\n\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2} \\right). \\]\n\nThis represents the same solution expressed in terms of the new basis vectors.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",
