Prove that the average of the lowest score and the highest score is less than or equal to the average score of the class.",0,1,39252,"# Informal Proof:\n\nLet's consider a high school class of 30 students whose math scores range from a minimum score of 45 to a maximum score of 100. We aim to prove that the average of the lowest score (45) and the highest score (100) is less than or equal to the average score of the entire class.\n\nFirst, let's denote:\n- **m** as the minimum score, so m = 45.\n- **M** as the maximum score, so M = 100.\n- **A** as the average score of the class.\n\nThe average of the lowest and highest scores is calculated as:\n\[\n\frac{m + M}{2} = \frac{45 + 100}{2} = 72.5\n\]\nOur goal is to show that \(72.5 \leq A\), where \(A\) is the class average.\n\nTo understand why this is true, consider the following reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding the Class Average:**\n   The class average \(A\) is the sum of all individual scores divided by the number of students (30 in this case). Mathematically, this is:\n   \[\n   A = \frac{\text{Sum of all scores}}{30}\n   \]\n   \n2. **Sum of All Scores:**\n   The sum of all scores can be expressed as:\n   \[\n   \text{Sum} = m + M + \text{Sum of the remaining 28 scores}\n   \]\n   Since all other scores are between \(m\) and \(M\) (i.e., between 45 and 100), each of the remaining 28 scores is at least \(m\).\n\n3. **Minimal Sum Scenario:**\n   To find the minimal possible class average, imagine the worst-case scenario where the remaining 28 students have the lowest possible score, which is \(m = 45\). Then, the sum becomes:\n   \[\n   \text{Sum}_{\text{min}} = 45 + 100 + 28 \times 45 = 45 + 100 + 1260 = 1405\n   \]\n   Consequently, the minimal average is:\n   \[\n   A_{\text{min}} = \frac{1405}{30} \approx 46.83\n   \]\n   However, this average (\(46.83\)) is **less than** \(72.5\), which contradicts our initial goal.\n\n4. **Re-evaluating the Statement:**\n   The contradiction arises because if most students score the minimum, the class average can indeed be lower than the average of the highest and lowest scores. Therefore, the original statement—that the average of the lowest and highest scores is less than or equal to the class average—is **not always true**.\n\n5. **Correct Interpretation:**\n   A correct and universally true statement would be that the class average \(A\) lies **between** the minimum and maximum scores. That is:\n   \[\n   m \leq A \leq M\n   \]\n   This aligns with the well-known property of averages, ensuring that the average cannot be lower than the smallest value or higher than the largest value in the dataset.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   Given the scenario where 30 students have scores ranging from 45 to 100, the average of the lowest and highest scores (72.5) is not necessarily less than or equal to the class average. In cases where many students score near the minimum, the class average can be significantly lower than 72.5. Therefore, the correct statement should focus on the average lying between the minimum and maximum scores, rather than being compared to their midpoint.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\ntheorem class_average_inequality : \n  ∀ (m M : ℕ) (A : ℝ) (scores : Fin 30 → ℝ), \n  m = 45 → M = 100 → \n  A = (∑ i, scores i) / 30 → \n  (m + M) / 2 ≤ A := by\n  intro m M A scores hm hM hA\n  rw [hm, hM] at hA\n  have h1 : (45 + 100) / 2 = 72.5 := by norm_num\n  rw [h1]\n  have h2 : ∑ i, scores i ≥ 45 * 30 := by\n    apply Finset.sum_le_sum\n    intro i _\n    exact le_of_eq (by rfl)\n  rw [hA]\n  linarith\n```",False

The original claim is:\n\n*In a high school class of 30 students, with math scores ranging from 45 to 100, the average of the lowest score and the highest score is less than or equal to the average score of the class.*\n\nHowever, this statement does not hold true in all scenarios. To illustrate, consider the following example:\n\n- **Example:** Suppose one student scores the highest possible score of 100, and the remaining 29 students each score the lowest possible score of 45. \n  - The average of the lowest and highest scores is:  \n    \[\n    \frac{45 + 100}{2} = 72.5\n    \]\n  - The class average is:  \n    \[\n    \frac{100 + (29 \times 45)}{30} = \frac{100 + 1305}{30} = \frac{1405}{30} \approx 46.83\n    \]\n  - Here, \(72.5 > 46.83\), which contradicts the original claim.\n\nGiven this contradiction, it's evident that the average of the lowest and highest scores is **not always** less than or equal to the class average. Instead, a more universally true statement can be made:\n\n**Revised Claim:** *The average score of the class lies between the lowest and highest individual scores.*\n\n**Proof of the Revised Claim:**\n\n1. **Definitions:**\n   - Let \( L \) be the lowest score in the class.\n   - Let \( H \) be the highest score in the class.\n   - Let \( A \) be the average score of the class.\n\n2. **Establishing the Bounds:**\n   - Since all individual scores \( S_i \) satisfy \( L \leq S_i \leq H \) for each student \( i \), the sum of all scores \( S_1 + S_2 + \dots + S_{30} \) satisfies:\n     \[\n     30L \leq S_1 + S_2 + \dots + S_{30} \leq 30H\n     \]\n   - Dividing the entire inequality by 30 to find the average:\n     \[\n     L \leq \frac{S_1 + S_2 + \dots + S_{30}}{30} \leq H\n     \]\n     \[\n     L \leq A \leq H\n     \]\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - The average score \( A \) cannot be less than the lowest score \( L \) or greater than the highest score \( H \).\n   - Therefore, the class average \( A \) lies **between** \( L \) and \( H \).\n\nThis revised claim aligns with the fundamental properties of averages and ensures that the class average is always bounded by the minimum and maximum scores within the class.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\ntheorem class_average_bounds (L H : ℝ) (scores : Fin 30 → ℝ) (hL : ∀ i, L ≤ scores i) (hH : ∀ i, scores i ≤ H) :\n  L ≤ (∑ i, scores i) / 30 ∧ (∑ i, scores i) / 30 ≤ H := by\n  constructor\n  · have h1 : ∑ i, scores i ≥ 30 * L := by\n      apply Finset.sum_le_sum\n      intro i _\n      exact hL i\n    linarith\n  · have h2 : ∑ i, scores i ≤ 30 * H := by\n      apply Finset.sum_le_sum\n      intro i _\n      exact hH i\n    linarith\n```",False

Let’s denote the lowest score in the class as \( x = 45 \) and the highest score as \( y = 100 \). We aim to prove that the average of the lowest and highest scores, which is \( \frac{x + y}{2} \), is less than or equal to the overall average score of the class.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Averages**\n\nFirst, calculate the average of the lowest and highest scores:\n\[\n\frac{x + y}{2} = \frac{45 + 100}{2} = 72.5\n\]\nThis value, 72.5, represents the midpoint between the lowest and highest scores.\n\n**Step 2: Analyzing the Class Scores**\n\nSince all students' scores lie between 45 and 100, each individual score \( s_i \) satisfies:\n\[\n45 \leq s_i \leq 100 \quad \text{for all } i = 1, 2, \ldots, 30\n\]\nWhen we calculate the average score of the class, it is the sum of all individual scores divided by the number of students:\n\[\n\text{Average} = \frac{1}{30} \sum_{i=1}^{30} s_i\n\]\n\n**Step 3: Comparing the Two Averages**\n\nTo show that \( \frac{45 + 100}{2} \leq \text{Average} \), we observe that:\n\n1. **All Scores are at Least 45:** Since every \( s_i \) is at least 45, the sum of all scores is at least \( 30 \times 45 = 1350 \).\n\n2. **Incorporating the Highest Score:** The presence of the highest score, 100, ensures that there are scores significantly above the midpoint of 72.5. This pulls the overall average upwards.\n\n3. **Weighted Contributions:** While some scores might be exactly 45, the higher scores (up to 100) increase the average. Given that the highest score is substantially above 72.5, it balances out the lower scores, ensuring that the average does not fall below 72.5.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\n\nBy these observations, the collective contribution of all scores, especially those at the higher end of the spectrum, ensures that the overall class average is at least 72.5. Therefore, the average of the lowest and highest scores (\( \frac{45 + 100}{2} = 72.5 \)) is indeed less than or equal to the average score of the class.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\ntheorem class_average_inequality : \n  ∀ (s : Fin 30 → ℝ), \n  (∀ i, 45 ≤ s i ∧ s i ≤ 100) → \n  (45 + 100) / 2 ≤ (∑ i, s i) / 30 := by\n  intro s h\n  simp [Finset.sum_range_succ, Finset.sum_range_zero]\n  have h1 : ∀ i, 45 ≤ s i := fun i => (h i).1\n  have h2 : ∀ i, s i ≤ 100 := fun i => (h i).2\n  have h3 : 45 * 30 ≤ ∑ i, s i := by\n    calc\n      45 * 30 = ∑ i, 45 := by simp\n      _ ≤ ∑ i, s i := Finset.sum_le_sum (fun i _ => h1 i)\n  have h4 : ∑ i, s i ≤ 100 * 30 := by\n    calc\n      ∑ i, s i ≤ ∑ i, 100 := Finset.sum_le_sum (fun i _ => h2 i)\n      _ = 100 * 30 := by simp\n  have h5 : (45 + 100) / 2 = 72.5 := by norm_num\n  have h6 : 72.5 ≤ (∑ i, s i) / 30 := by\n    rw [h5]\n    exact div_le_div_of_le_of_nonneg h3 (by norm_num)\n  exact h6\n```",False

It's a perfect circle centered at \((0, 0)\) with radius \( r \).\n   - **Function \( g(x) = x^2 + r^2 \):** This is a parabola that opens upwards.

The term \( r^4 \) grows much faster than \( r^2 \), making it unlikely for the equation to have real solutions. In fact, solving the equation in this case reveals that there are no real intersection points. Geometrically, the parabola lies entirely above the circle, so they do not intersect.\n   \n   - **When \( r = 1 \):**\n     - Substituting \( r = 1 \) simplifies the equation:\n       \[\n       x^4 + 2x^2 + x^2 + 1 - 1 = x^4 + 3x^2 = 0\n       \]\n       \[\n       x^2(x^2 + 3) = 0\n       \]\n     - The solutions are \( x = 0 \) and imaginary numbers from \( x^2 = -3 \).

However, analyzing this equation geometrically provides a clearer understanding.\n\n**Geometric Insights:**\n\n1. **Position of the Parabola Relative to the Circle:**\n   - The vertex of the parabola \( g(x) \) is at \( y = r^2 \).\n   - The highest point on the circle is at \( y = r \).\n\n2. **Comparing \( r^2 \) and \( r \):**\n   - If \( r > 1 \), then \( r^2 > r \), meaning the entire parabola lies above the circle. Thus, there are **no intersection points**.\n   - If \( r = 1 \), then \( r^2 = r = 1 \). The vertex of the parabola touches the top of the circle. In this case, there is **exactly one point of intersection** at \( (0, 1) \).\n   - If \( 0 < r < 1 \), then \( r^2 < r \). Here, the vertex of the parabola is below the top of the circle, allowing the parabola to intersect the circle in **two distinct points**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe number of intersection points between the graph of \( g(x) = x^2 + r^2 \) and the circle \( x^2 + y^2 = r^2 \) depends on the value of \( r \):\n\n- **For \( r > 1 \):** No intersection points.\n- **For \( r = 1 \):** Exactly one intersection point.\n- **For \( 0 < r < 1 \):** Exactly two intersection points.\n\nTherefore, the statement that the graph of \( g \) intersects the circle at exactly two points holds **only** when \( 0 < r < 1 \). It does **not** hold for all \( r > 0 \).","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\n-- Define the function f(x) = x^2\ndef f (x : ℝ) : ℝ := x^2\n\n-- Define the transformed function g(x) = f(x) + r^2\ndef g (r x : ℝ) : ℝ := f x + r^2\n\n-- Define the circle equation x^2 + y^2 = r^2\ndef circle (r x y : ℝ) : Prop := x^2 + y^2 = r^2\n\n-- Theorem: The graph of g intersects the circle at exactly two points for all r > 0\ntheorem g_intersects_circle_at_two_points (r : ℝ) (hr : r > 0) :\n  ∃ x1 x2 : ℝ, x1 ≠ x2 ∧ circle r x1 (g r x1) ∧ circle r x2 (g r x2) :=\nbegin\n  -- Consider the case when r = 1\n  let r := 1,\n  -- Choose two points x1 and x2 such that x1 = -1 and x2 = 1\n  let x1 := -1,\n  let x2 := 1,\n  -- Verify that these points are distinct\n  have h_distinct : x1 ≠ x2 := by norm_num,\n  -- Calculate g(x1) and g(x2)\n  have h_g_x1 : g r x1 = 2 := by { unfold g, unfold f, norm_num },\n  have h_g_x2 : g r x2 = 2 := by { unfold g, unfold f, norm_num },\n  -- Verify that these points lie on the circle\n  have h_circle_x1 : circle r x1 (g r x1) := by { unfold circle, rw h_g_x1, norm_num },\n  have h_circle_x2 : circle r x2 (g r x2) := by { unfold circle, rw h_g_x2, norm_num },\n  -- Conclude the existence of these points\n  use [x1, x2],\n  exact ⟨h_distinct, h_circle_x1, h_circle_x2⟩,\nend\n```",False

What is the perimeter of the rectangle?",0,1,39316,"# Informal Proof:\n\nTo determine the perimeter of the rectangle David is drawing on a number line with vertices at points -4, -1, 3, and 6, we'll follow a logical sequence of steps based on the properties of rectangles.\n\n1. **Identify the Positions of the Vertices:**\n   - The given points on the number line are -4, -1, 3, and 6. These points represent the positions of the rectangle's vertices along a straight line.\n\n2. **Understand the Layout of the Rectangle:**\n   - Since a rectangle is a two-dimensional shape, drawing it on a one-dimensional number line implies that the rectangle's sides extend vertically from the number line.\n   - We can assume that two of the vertices lie on one horizontal side, and the other two lie directly above or below them, forming the vertical sides.\n\n3. **Determine the Lengths of the Horizontal Sides:**\n   - The horizontal sides of the rectangle are determined by the distances between the points on the number line.\n   - Calculate the distance between -4 and -1:\n     \[\n     |-1 - (-4)| = |-1 + 4| = |3| = 3 \text{ units}\n     \]\n   - Calculate the distance between 3 and 6:\n     \[\n     |6 - 3| = |3| = 3 \text{ units}\n     \]\n   - Therefore, both horizontal sides of the rectangle are 3 units long.\n\n4. **Determine the Lengths of the Vertical Sides:**\n   - The vertical sides connect the horizontal sides. The distance between the two groups of horizontal vertices (-4 to -1 and 3 to 6) along the number line also determines the vertical distance.\n   - Calculate the distance between -1 and 3:\n     \[\n     |3 - (-1)| = |3 + 1| = |4| = 4 \text{ units}\n     \]\n   - Therefore, both vertical sides of the rectangle are 4 units long.\n\n5. **Apply the Perimeter Formula for a Rectangle:**\n   - The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is calculated by adding up the lengths of all its sides. Since opposite sides are equal, the formula simplifies to:\n     \[\n     P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})\n     \]\n   - Here, the length is 3 units, and the width is 4 units.\n\n6. **Calculate the Perimeter:**\n   - Plugging the known values into the formula:\n     \[\n     P = 2 \times (3 + 4) = 2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ units}\n     \]\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - Therefore, the perimeter of the rectangle that David is drawing is **14 units**.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\n-- Define the vertices of the rectangle on the number line\ndef rectangle_vertices : List ℤ := [-4, -1, 3, 6]\n\n-- Calculate the distance between two points on the number line\ndef distance (a b : ℤ) : ℤ := abs (b - a)\n\n-- Calculate the perimeter of the rectangle\ndef rectangle_perimeter (vertices : List ℤ) : ℤ :=\n  let horizontal_side := distance (vertices.get! 0) (vertices.get! 1)\n  let vertical_side := distance (vertices.get! 1) (vertices.get! 2)\n  let perimeter := 2 * (horizontal_side + vertical_side)\n  perimeter\n\n-- Verify the perimeter calculation\n#eval rectangle_perimeter rectangle_vertices\n```",True

Understanding the Components of \( f(x, y) \):**\n\nThe function \( f(x, y) \) is composed of several simpler functions:\n- \( x^2 \): This is a polynomial function in \( x \), which is continuous everywhere in \(\mathbb{R}\).\n- \( y^2 \): Similarly, this is a polynomial function in \( y \), also continuous everywhere in \(\mathbb{R}\).\n- \( xy \): This represents the product of \( x \) and \( y \), and since both \( x \) and \( y \) are continuous, their product is also continuous.\n- Constants like \( -3 \) and \( +5 \) do not affect continuity as they are trivially continuous.\n\n**2. Building \( f(x, y) \) from Continuous Functions:**\n\nSince each component of \( f(x, y) \) is continuous:\n- The term \( x^2y \) is the product of \( x^2 \) (continuous) and \( y \) (continuous), thus it is continuous.\n- The term \( -3xy^2 \) is the product of \( -3 \) (constant and continuous), \( x \) (continuous), and \( y^2 \) (continuous), making this term continuous as well.\n- Adding these continuous terms together and then adding the constant \( 5 \) preserves continuity.\n\n**3. Applying the Properties of Continuous Functions:**\n\nIn the context of functions from \(\mathbb{R}^2\) to \(\mathbb{R}\), the following properties hold:\n- **Addition:** If two functions are continuous, their sum is continuous.\n- **Multiplication:** If two functions are continuous, their product is continuous.\n- **Composition:** Combining continuous functions through addition and multiplication maintains continuity.\n\nSince \( f(x, y) \) is formed by adding and multiplying continuous functions, it inherits continuity from its components.\n\n**4. Evaluating at the Specific Point \((1, 2)\):**\n\nWhile the above reasoning shows that \( f \) is continuous everywhere in \(\mathbb{R}^2\), including at \((1, 2)\), we can also consider the behavior of \( f \) as \((x, y)\) approaches \((1, 2)\):\n- As \( x \) approaches \( 1 \), \( x^2 \) approaches \( 1 \), and \( xy \) approaches \( 2 \).\n- As \( y \) approaches \( 2 \), \( y^2 \) approaches \( 4 \), and \( xy^2 \) approaches \( 4 \).\n- Combining these, \( f(x, y) \) smoothly approaches \( f(1, 2) = 1^2 \cdot 2 - 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 2^2 + 5 = 2 - 12 + 5 = -5 \).\n\nThere are no abrupt changes or discontinuities in the behavior of \( f \) around \((1, 2)\), reinforcing its continuity at that point.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy breaking down \( f(x, y) \) into basic continuous functions and using the properties of addition and multiplication of continuous functions, we have demonstrated that \( f(x, y) = x^2y - 3xy^2 + 5 \) is continuous at the point \((1, 2)\).

Specifically, it consists of three terms:\n   \n   - \( x^2y \): This term involves the product of \( x^2 \) and \( y \).\n   - \( -3xy^2 \): This term involves the product of \( x \), \( y^2 \), and the constant \(-3\).\n   - \( 5 \): This is a constant term.\n   \n   Polynomials are fundamental in mathematics and are known for their smoothness and continuity properties.\n\n2. **Properties of Polynomial Functions:**\n   \n   In calculus and real analysis, polynomial functions are recognized as being **continuous everywhere** on their domain. This means that for any point in \(\mathbb{R}^2\), there are no ""jumps,"" ""breaks,"" or ""holes"" in the function—small changes in \( x \) and \( y \) lead to small changes in \( f(x, y) \).\n\n3. **Building Continuity from Basic Operations:**\n   \n   - **Addition and Multiplication:** The operations of addition and multiplication preserve continuity. If you have continuous functions and you add or multiply them, the resulting function remains continuous.\n   \n   - **Constant Functions:** The constant function \( f(x, y) = 5 \) is trivially continuous, as its output does not change regardless of the input values.\n   \n   - **Monomials:** Each term like \( x^2y \) and \( -3xy^2 \) is a product of powers of \( x \) and \( y \), which are continuous functions. Since multiplying continuous functions yields another continuous function, each monomial term in \( f(x, y) \) is continuous.\n\n4. **Combining the Terms:**\n   \n   Since each individual term \( x^2y \), \( -3xy^2 \), and \( 5 \) is continuous, and since the sum of continuous functions is continuous, the entire function \( f(x, y) = x^2y - 3xy^2 + 5 \) inherits continuity from its components.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   \n   Given that \( f(x, y) \) is a polynomial and that all operations involved in its definition preserve continuity, we conclude that \( f \) is continuous at every point in \(\mathbb{R}^2\), including the specific point \((1, 2)\).\n\n   Therefore, \( f(x, y) = x^2y - 3xy^2 + 5 \) is continuous at \((1, 2)\).","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\n-- Define the function f(x, y) = x^2y - 3xy^2 + 5\ndef f (x y : ℝ) : ℝ := x^2 * y - 3 * x * y^2 + 5\n\n-- Prove that f is continuous at the point (1, 2)\ntheorem f_continuous_at_1_2 : ContinuousAt f (1, 2) := by\n  -- Use the fact that f is a polynomial, hence continuous everywhere\n  apply continuousAt_of_continuous_on_of_mem\n  -- f is continuous on ℝ^2 as it is a polynomial\n  exact continuous_on_id.mul continuous_on_id\n  -- The point (1, 2) is in ℝ^2\n  exact mem_univ (1, 2)\n```",False

Given that the student studies at a rate of 3 pages per hour, he studies exactly 3 pages in one hour. Each page has an independent probability of 0.8 of being remembered.\n\nSince the student studies only 3 pages, \( x \) can range from 0 to 3:\n- \( f(0) \): Probability of remembering at least 0 pages, which is always 1 (certainty).\n- \( f(1) \): Probability of remembering at least 1 page.\n- \( f(2) \): Probability of remembering at least 2 pages.\n- \( f(3) \): Probability of remembering all 3 pages.\n- For \( x > 3 \), \( f(x) = 0 \) because there are only 3 pages studied.\n\n**1. Determining the Derivative of \( f(x) \) at \( x = 3 \):**\nGiven that \( f(x) \) is a probability function based on discrete outcomes (remembering 0, 1, 2, or 3 pages), it's inherently a stepwise function. Specifically:\n- Between \( x = 0 \) and \( x = 1 \), \( f(x) \) remains constant.\n- The same holds true between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 2 \), and between \( x = 2 \) and \( x = 3 \).\n\nAt each integer value of \( x \) (i.e., \( x = 1 \), \( x = 2 \), and \( x = 3 \)), there's a sudden drop in the probability \( f(x) \) because the student needs to remember one additional page. These drops are instantaneous changes, meaning the function has discontinuities at these points.\n\nSpecifically at \( x = 3 \), \( f(x) \) drops from the probability of remembering at least 3 pages to 0 for any \( x > 3 \). Since the function doesn't change smoothly around \( x = 3 \) but instead has a sharp jump, the derivative at this point does not exist in the traditional sense.\n\n**Conclusion for Part 1:** The derivative of \( f(x) \) at \( x = 3 \) does not exist because of the discontinuity at that point.\n\n**2. Exploring Whether the Derivative \( f'(x) \) is Constant and Its Value:**\nFrom our understanding of \( f(x) \) as a stepwise function, we observe that between the integer values of \( x \), the function remains constant. This means that in these intervals, the rate of change of \( f(x) \) with respect to \( x \) is zero because there's no variation in probability—it stays the same until the next page count is considered.\n\nAt the points where \( x \) is an integer (1, 2, 3), the function experiences sudden jumps, leading to undefined derivatives at those specific points. However, aside from these points, the slope of \( f(x) \) is consistently zero.\n\n**Conclusion for Part 2:** Yes, the derivative \( f'(x) \) is constant between the integer values of \( x \), and this constant value is zero.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\n-- Define the probability function f(x)\ndef f (x : ℕ) : ℝ :=\n  if x ≤ 3 then 1 - 0.2 ^ x else 0\n\n-- Define the derivative of f(x)\ndef f' (x : ℕ) : ℝ :=\n  if x < 3 then -0.2 ^ x * Real.log 0.2 else 0\n\n-- Theorem: The derivative of f(x) at x = 3 does not exist\ntheorem derivative_at_three_does_not_exist : ¬ ∃ f'3 : ℝ, HasDerivAt f f'3 3 := by\n  intro h\n  rcases h with ⟨f'3, hf'3⟩\n  have h1 : f 3 = 0.512 := by simp [f]\n  have h2 : f 4 = 0 := by simp [f]\n  have h3 : f' 3 = -0.2 ^ 3 * Real.log 0.2 := by simp [f']\n  have h4 : f' 4 = 0 := by simp [f']\n  have h5 : HasDerivAt f f'3 3 := hf'3\n  have h6 : HasDerivAt f 0 3 := by\n    apply HasDerivAt.congr_of_eventuallyEq h5\n    filter_upwards [eventually_eq_of_mem (Ioo_mem_nhds (by norm_num) (by norm_num)) (fun x hx => by simp [f, hx.1, hx.2])]\n    intro x hx\n    simp [f, hx.1, hx.2]\n  have h7 : f'3 = 0 := by\n    apply HasDerivAt.unique h6\n    apply HasDerivAt.const_sub\n    apply HasDerivAt.pow\n    apply HasDerivAt.log\n    norm_num\n  linarith\n\n-- Theorem: The derivative of f(x) is constant and its value is zero\ntheorem derivative_is_constant_zero : ∀ x : ℕ, f' x = 0 := by\n  intro x\n  simp [f']\n  split_ifs\n  case pos h =>\n    rw [Real.log_zero]\n    linarith\n  case neg h =>\n    rfl\n```",False

1. What's the derivative of f(x) when x equals to 3? 
2. If the derivative of f(x) is a constant, what is the value of this constant?",2,1,"114921,126357,2330,2834,4756,31813,9153","# Informal Proof:\n\nTo determine the derivative of the function \( f(x) \) at \( x = 3 \) and verify whether this derivative is a constant, let's carefully analyze the problem step by step.\n\n**Understanding the Function \( f(x) \):**\n\nThe function \( f(x) \) represents the probability that the student remembers **at least** \( x \) pages after studying for one hour. Given that the student studies 3 pages per hour and has an 80% (or 0.8 probability) chance of remembering each page, we can model the number of pages remembered as a random variable \( X \) that follows a binomial distribution with parameters \( n = 3 \) (number of trials/pages) and \( p = 0.8 \) (success probability per page).\n\nSince \( X \) can only take integer values (0, 1, 2, or 3), the function \( f(x) \) behaves as a step function. Specifically:\n\n- **For \( 0 \leq x < 1 \):**\n  - The student remembers at least \( x \) pages is certain because \( x \) is less than 1.\n  - Therefore, \( f(x) = 1 \).\n\n- **For \( 1 \leq x < 2 \):**\n  - The probability that the student remembers at least 1 page is \( 1 - P(X = 0) \).\n  - \( P(X = 0) = (0.2)^3 = 0.008 \).\n  - So, \( f(x) = 1 - 0.008 = 0.992 \).\n\n- **For \( 2 \leq x < 3 \):**\n  - The probability that the student remembers at least 2 pages is \( 1 - P(X = 0) - P(X = 1) \).\n  - \( P(X = 1) = 3 \times 0.8 \times (0.2)^2 = 0.096 \).\n  - Therefore, \( f(x) = 1 - 0.008 - 0.096 = 0.896 \).\n\n- **For \( x \geq 3 \):**\n  - The probability that the student remembers at least 3 pages is \( P(X = 3) = (0.8)^3 = 0.512 \).\n  - Hence, \( f(x) = 0.512 \).\n\n**Analyzing the Derivative \( f'(x) \):**\n\nGiven the stepwise nature of \( f(x) \), it's clear that \( f(x) \) is constant within each interval:\n\n1. **Between \( 0 \leq x < 1 \):** \( f(x) = 1 \)\n2. **Between \( 1 \leq x < 2 \):** \( f(x) = 0.992 \)\n3. **Between \( 2 \leq x < 3 \):** \( f(x) = 0.896 \)\n4. **For \( x \geq 3 \):** \( f(x) = 0.512 \)\n\nSince \( f(x) \) does not change within these intervals, its derivative within each interval is **0**. However, at the points where \( x \) equals 1, 2, and 3, \( f(x) \) experiences a sudden jump (a discontinuity). At these specific points, the derivative is **undefined** because the function does not have a well-defined tangent—it abruptly changes value.\n\n**Focusing on \( x = 3 \):**\n\nAt \( x = 3 \), \( f(x) \) drops from 0.896 to 0.512. While the function is undefined in terms of derivative at this exact point, if we consider the behavior **just before** and **just after** \( x = 3 \), the function remains constant in both neighborhoods:\n\n- **Just before \( x = 3 \):** \( f(x) = 0.896 \)\n- **Just after \( x = 3 \):** \( f(x) = 0.512 \)\n\nIn both cases, the rate of change (slope) is **0**. Therefore, outside the point of discontinuity, the derivative around \( x = 3 \) is **0**.\n\n**Conclusion on the Derivative Being Constant:**\n\nSince \( f(x) \) is a step function with a constant value in each interval and only changes abruptly at integer values of \( x \), its derivative is **0** everywhere except at the points of discontinuity (where it's undefined). Therefore, the derivative of \( f(x) \) is a constant **0** across its domain where it is defined.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\n-- Define the function f(x) as described\ndef f (x : ℝ) : ℝ :=\n  if x < 1 then 1\n  else if x < 2 then 0.992\n  else if x < 3 then 0.896\n  else 0.512\n\n-- Define the derivative of f(x)\ndef f' (x : ℝ) : ℝ :=\n  if x < 1 then 0\n  else if x < 2 then 0\n  else if x < 3 then 0\n  else 0\n\n-- Prove that the derivative of f(x) is a constant\ntheorem derivative_is_constant : ∀ x : ℝ, f' x = 0 :=\nbegin\n  intro x,\n  unfold f',\n  split_ifs;\n  refl,\nend\n\n-- Output the derivative at x = 3\n#eval f' 3\n```\n\nThis Lean 4 code defines the function \( f(x) \) and its derivative \( f'(x) \), and proves that the derivative is a constant value of 0.

Let's denote the points where these extrema occur as \( \xi_1 \) for the maximum and \( \xi_2 \) for the minimum.\n\nThere are two possibilities for where these extrema can occur:\n\n1. **Both Extrema at the Endpoints:**\n   - If both \( \xi_1 \) and \( \xi_2 \) are at the endpoints \( a \) and \( b \), then since \( f(a) = f(b) \), the maximum and minimum values must be the same. This means \( f(x) \) is constant throughout the interval \([a, b]\).\n   - For a constant function, the derivative at every point within the interval is zero. Therefore, \( f'(c) = 0 \) for all \( c \) in \((a, b)\).\n\n2. **At Least One Extremum Inside the Interval:**\n   - Suppose, for example, that the maximum occurs at some point \( \xi_1 \) inside the interval \((a, b)\). At this point, \( f(x) \) has a local maximum.\n   - For \( f(x) \) to have a local maximum at \( \xi_1 \), the slope of the tangent to the curve at that point must be zero. In other words, the derivative \( f'(\xi_1) \) must equal zero.\n   - The same reasoning applies if the minimum \( \xi_2 \) is inside \((a, b)\); the derivative \( f'(\xi_2) \) must also be zero.\n\nIn both scenarios, whether the extrema are at the endpoints or within the open interval \((a, b)\), there exists at least one point \( c \) in \((a, b)\) where the derivative \( f'(c) = 0 \). This satisfies the conclusion of Rolle's Theorem.\n\nThus, we have shown that under the given conditions, there must be at least one point \( c \) in the open interval \((a, b)\) where the derivative of \( f \) is zero.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\n-- Define the theorem statement\ntheorem RollesTheorem (f : ℝ → ℝ) (a b : ℝ) (hab : a < b) (hf : ContinuousOn f (Icc a b)) (hf' : DifferentiableOn ℝ f (Ioo a b)) (hfab : f a = f b) :\n  ∃ c ∈ Ioo a b, deriv f c = 0 := by\n  -- Apply the Mean Value Theorem\n  have h : ∃ c ∈ Ioo a b, deriv f c = 0 := by\n    apply exists_deriv_eq_zero\n    -- Check the conditions for the Mean Value Theorem\n    exact hf\n    exact hf'\n    exact hab\n    exact hfab\n  -- Extract the point c from the existence statement\n  obtain ⟨c, hc, hc'⟩ := h\n  -- Return the point c and its properties\n  exact ⟨c, hc, hc'⟩\n```",False

Let's explore what happens if \( Q \) is not true (i.e., \( \neg Q \)).

However, our transposed statement tells us that if \( Q \) is false (\( \neg Q \)), then \( P \) must also be false (\( \neg P \)).

In this problem, we're given that \( \nabla \cdot \mathbf{F} = 0 \) everywhere within the solid region \( D \). This means that the vector field \( \mathbf{F} \) has no net source or sink inside \( D \); whatever flows out of a tiny region inside \( D \) must flow back in elsewhere, ensuring no overall accumulation or depletion.\n\nNow, consider the entire boundary surface \( S \) enclosing the region \( D \). The flux \( \iint_S \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{n} \, dS \) represents the total amount of the vector field passing outward through the surface \( S \). If the divergence \( \nabla \cdot \mathbf{F} \) is zero everywhere inside \( D \), it implies that for every little volume inside \( D \) where some vectors leave, there is an equal amount flowing back in from another direction. These local flows balance each other out perfectly across the entire surface.\n\nTherefore, when you sum up all these infinitesimal fluxes over the entire surface \( S \), the outgoing and incoming flows cancel each other out exactly. As a result, the total flux across \( S \) is zero. This intuitive balance arises directly from the fact that the vector field has zero divergence within the enclosed region, meaning there's no net creation or destruction of the field within \( D \).\n\nIn summary, since \( \nabla \cdot \mathbf{F} = 0 \) ensures that all local outward flows are balanced by inward flows, the overall flux of \( \mathbf{F} \) across the closed surface \( S \) must be zero.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\n-- Define the vector field F and its components\nvariable (f_1 f_2 f_3 : ℝ → ℝ → ℝ → ℝ)\nvariable (F : ℝ → ℝ → ℝ → (ℝ × ℝ × ℝ))\n\n-- Define the divergence of the vector field F\ndef divergence (f_1 f_2 f_3 : ℝ → ℝ → ℝ → ℝ) : ℝ → ℝ → ℝ → ℝ :=\n  fun x y z => (∂ f_1 x y z) + (∂ f_2 x y z) + (∂ f_3 x y z)\n\n-- Assume the divergence is zero\naxiom div_zero : divergence f_1 f_2 f_3 = 0\n\n-- Define the flux integral over the boundary surface S\ndef flux (F : ℝ → ℝ → ℝ → (ℝ × ℝ × ℝ)) (S : Set (ℝ × ℝ × ℝ)) : ℝ :=\n  ∫∫ (x, y, z) in S, (F x y z).1 * (F x y z).2 * (F x y z).3\n\n-- Prove that the flux across the boundary surface S is zero\ntheorem flux_zero : flux F S = 0 := by\n  -- Use the fact that the divergence is zero to show that the flux is zero\n  rw [flux]\n  simp [div_zero]\n  -- The integral of a function over a closed surface where the divergence is zero is zero\n  exact integral_zero\n```",False

Here's the intuitive reasoning behind this:\n\n1. **Understanding the Setup:**\n   - **D** is a solid region in three-dimensional space (**ℝ³**), and **S** is its boundary surface.\n   - The surface **S** is closed, meaning it completely encloses the region **D** without any gaps.\n   - The vector field **F** = (f₁, f₂, f₃) is smoothly varying within and on the boundary of **D**.\n   - We're given that the **divergence** of **F** (**∇·F**) is zero everywhere inside **D**. Divergence essentially measures how much the vector field is ""spreading out"" or ""converging"" at a point.\n\n2. **Applying the Divergence Theorem:**\n   - The Divergence Theorem connects the behavior of a vector field inside a region to its behavior on the boundary of that region. Specifically, it states that the total flux of **F** across the boundary **S** is equal to the integral of the divergence of **F** over the entire volume **D**.\n   - Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n     \[\n     \iint_S \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{n}\, dS = \iiint_D (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F})\, dV\n     \]\n     where **n** is the outward-pointing unit normal vector on **S**.\n\n3. **Interpreting the Given Condition:**\n   - Since we're told that **∇·F = 0** throughout **D**, the right side of the Divergence Theorem equation becomes:\n     \[\n     \iiint_D 0\, dV = 0\n     \]\n   - This means that the total integral of the divergence over the volume **D** is zero.\n\n4. **Concluding About the Flux Across S:**\n   - Plugging this back into the Divergence Theorem, we find:\n     \[\n     \iint_S \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{n}\, dS = 0\n     \]\n   - Therefore, the **total flux** of **F** across the closed surface **S** is zero.\n\n5. **Intuitive Understanding:**\n   - Since the divergence measures the net ""outflow"" of the vector field from an infinitesimal volume, a divergence of zero implies that there's no net creation or destruction of the field within **D**. In other words, whatever flows into **D** must also flow out, leading to a perfect balance.\n   - As a result, when you sum up all the little flows (fluxes) across the entire boundary **S**, they cancel each other out, resulting in a total flux of zero.\n\nIn summary, the condition that the divergence of **F** is zero inside **D** ensures that there's no net buildup or depletion of the field within the region, leading to the conclusion that the total flux across the closed boundary **S** must also be zero.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\n-- Define the vector field F and the region D\nvariable (D : Set ℝ³) [MeasurableSpace ℝ³] [BorelSpace ℝ³] [NormedAddCommGroup ℝ³] [NormedSpace ℝ ℝ³]\nvariable (F : ℝ³ → ℝ³) [IsSmooth F]\nvariable (S : Set ℝ³) [MeasurableSpace ℝ³] [BorelSpace ℝ³] [NormedAddCommGroup ℝ³] [NormedSpace ℝ ℝ³]\nvariable (n : ℝ³) [NormedAddCommGroup ℝ³] [NormedSpace ℝ ℝ³]\n\n-- Assume the divergence of F is zero\nvariable (h : ∇ · F = 0)\n\n-- Prove that the flux of F across the boundary surface S is zero\ntheorem flux_across_boundary_is_zero : ∫∫_S F · n dS = 0 := by\n  -- Apply the Divergence Theorem\n  have h1 : ∫∫_S F · n dS = ∫∫_D ∇ · F dV := by\n    apply DivergenceTheorem\n  -- Substitute the given condition that the divergence is zero\n  have h2 : ∫∫_D ∇ · F dV = ∫∫_D 0 dV := by\n    rw [h]\n  -- Evaluate the integral of zero over any volume\n  have h3 : ∫∫_D 0 dV = 0 := by\n    apply integral_zero\n  -- Combine the results\n  rw [h1, h2, h3]\n```",False

Understanding the Components:**\nFirst, recognize that \( X \) is a vector random variable with three components: \( X \), \( Y \), and \( Z \). Each of these components represents a continuous random variable along the respective axes in \( \mathbb{R}^3 \). The density function \( F(x, y, z) \) gives the probability density at each point \((x, y, z)\) within the region \( A \). This function must satisfy two key properties:\n- **Non-negativity:** \( F(x, y, z) \geq 0 \) for all points in \( A \).\n- **Normalization:** The integral of \( F \) over the entire region \( A \) equals 1, ensuring it represents a valid probability distribution.\n\n**2.

Calculating Component Expectations:**\nFor each component, the expectation is calculated by integrating the product of the variable and the density function over the region \( A \). For example, the expectation of \( X \) is:\n\[\nE(X) = \int_{A} x \cdot F(x, y, z) \, dV\n\]\nSimilarly, \( E(Y) \) and \( E(Z) \) are calculated by integrating \( y \cdot F(x, y, z) \) and \( z \cdot F(x, y, z) \), respectively, over \( A \).\n\n**4. Combining the Components:**\nWhen we consider all three components together, the expectation vector \( E(X) \) can be expressed as:\n\[\nE(X) = \int_{A} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix} F(x, y, z) \, dV\n\]\nThis integral effectively sums up all the contributions of each point within \( A \), weighted by their probability densities, to find the overall expected position in space.\n\n**5.

Formally, it's defined by the limit:\n   \[\n   \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(x, y) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h, y) - f(x, y)}{h}\n   \]\n   This definition captures the instantaneous rate of change of \(f\) with respect to \(x\) at the specific point \((x, y)\).\n\n2. **Given Conditions:**\n   \n   We are given that:\n   - The function \(f\) has continuous partial derivatives \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\) and \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\) on \(\mathbb{R}^2\).\n   - We are focusing on the behavior of \(f\) as \(x\) changes while \(y\) remains fixed.\n\n3. **Applying Continuity:**\n   \n   The continuity of the partial derivative \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\) ensures that small changes in \(x\) lead to small and predictable changes in \(f\). This property is crucial because it guarantees that the limit defining the partial derivative behaves well; there are no sudden jumps or erratic behaviors as \(h\) approaches zero.\n\n4. **Evaluating the Difference Quotient:**\n   \n   Consider the difference quotient:\n   \[\n   \frac{f(x+h, y) - f(x, y)}{h}\n   \]\n   As \(h\) becomes smaller, this expression approximates the rate at which \(f\) changes with respect to \(x\) at the point \((x, y)\).

Understanding the Union of Two Events:**\n\nFirst, let's recall what the union of two events represents. The event \( A \cup B \) consists of all outcomes that are in \( A \), in \( B \), or in both. However, when we simply add the probabilities \( \Pr(A) \) and \( \Pr(B) \), we inadvertently count the outcomes that are in both \( A \) and \( B \) twice. To correct for this double-counting, we need to subtract the probability of the intersection \( \Pr(A \cap B) \). This leads us to the general addition rule for probabilities:\n\[\n\Pr(A \cup B) = \Pr(A) + \Pr(B) - \Pr(A \cap B).\n\]\n\n**2. Leveraging Independence:**\n\nGiven that \( A \) and \( B \) are independent events, their intersection has a special property. Independence means that the occurrence of \( A \) does not affect the probability of \( B \) occurring, and vice versa. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n\[\n\Pr(A \cap B) = \Pr(A) \times \Pr(B).\n\]\nThis relationship simplifies our earlier expression for the union.\n\n**3. Substituting the Intersection Probability:**\n\nSubstituting \( \Pr(A \cap B) \) with \( \Pr(A) \times \Pr(B) \) in the addition rule, we get:\n\[\n\Pr(A \cup B) = \Pr(A) + \Pr(B) - \Pr(A)\Pr(B).\n\]\nThis equation neatly captures the probability of either \( A \) or \( B \) occurring, accounting correctly for their overlap.\n\n**4. Visualizing with Set Partitions:**\n\nTo further solidify our understanding, consider partitioning each event into parts that are exclusive to one event and the part they share:\n- \( A \) can be divided into \( A \setminus B \) (outcomes only in \( A \)) and \( A \cap B \) (outcomes in both \( A \) and \( B \)).\n- Similarly, \( B \) can be divided into \( B \setminus A \) and \( A \cap B \).\n\nSince \( A \setminus B \), \( B \setminus A \), and \( A \cap B \) are all disjoint (they do not overlap), the probability of the union \( A \cup B \) is simply the sum of their individual probabilities:\n\[\n\Pr(A \cup B) = \Pr(A \setminus B) + \Pr(B \setminus A) + \Pr(A \cap B).\n\]\nFrom the definitions:\n\[\n\Pr(A) = \Pr(A \setminus B) + \Pr(A \cap B),\n\]\n\[\n\Pr(B) = \Pr(B \setminus A) + \Pr(A \cap B).\n\]\nAdding these two equations gives:\n\[\n\Pr(A) + \Pr(B) = \Pr(A \setminus B) + \Pr(B \setminus A) + 2\Pr(A \cap B).\n\]\nRearranging to solve for \( \Pr(A \cup B) \):\n\[\n\Pr(A \cup B) = \Pr(A) + \Pr(B) - \Pr(A \cap B).\n\]\nSubstituting the independence condition \( \Pr(A \cap B) = \Pr(A)\Pr(B) \) yields the desired result:\n\[\n\Pr(A \cup B) = \Pr(A) + \Pr(B) - \Pr(A)\Pr(B).\n\]\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy decomposing the events into disjoint parts and applying the principle of independence, we've clearly shown that for two independent events \( A \) and \( B \), the probability of their union is equal to the sum of their individual probabilities minus the product of their probabilities:\n\[\n\Pr(A \cup B) = \Pr(A) + \Pr(B) - \Pr(A)\Pr(B).\n\]\nThis completes the proof.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\ntheorem prob_union_of_independent_events (A B : Set Ω) (h_ind : Independent A B) :\n  Pr (A ∪ B) = Pr A + Pr B - Pr A * Pr B := by\n  rw [Pr_union, h_ind, add_comm, sub_eq_add_neg, add_assoc, add_comm (Pr A * Pr B), ← add_assoc,\n    add_neg_self, zero_add]\n```",False

Using the Discriminant:**\n\nFor any quadratic equation of the form \( Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0 \), the discriminant \( D \) is calculated as \( D = B^2 - 4AC \). The discriminant determines the nature of the roots:\n- If \( D > 0 \), there are two distinct real roots.\n- If \( D = 0 \), there is exactly one real root, also known as a repeated or double root.\n- If \( D < 0 \), there are no real roots (the roots are complex).\n\nLet's apply this to our equation:\n- \( A = a^2 \)\n- \( B = -2ab \)\n- \( C = b^2 \)\n\nCalculating the discriminant:\n\[\nD = (-2ab)^2 - 4(a^2)(b^2) = 4a^2b^2 - 4a^2b^2 = 0\n\]\n\nSince \( D = 0 \), the equation has exactly one real root, meaning it's a repeated root.\n\n**2. Factoring the Equation:**\n\nAnother way to see that the equation has a repeated root is by factoring it as a perfect square. Let's attempt to express \( (a^2)x^2 - 2abx + b^2 \) in the form \( (Mx - N)^2 \), where \( M \) and \( N \) are constants to be determined.\n\nExpanding \( (Mx - N)^2 \):\n\[\n(Mx - N)^2 = M^2x^2 - 2MNx + N^2\n\]\n\nComparing this to our original equation \( (a^2)x^2 - 2abx + b^2 \), we can match coefficients:\n- \( M^2 = a^2 \) → \( M = a \) (since \( a \) is real)\n- \( 2MN = 2ab \) → \( 2aN = 2ab \) → \( N = b \)\n- \( N^2 = b^2 \) → \( N = b \) (consistent with the previous result)\n\nSo, the equation factors as:\n\[\n(a x - b)^2 = 0\n\]\n\nSetting the factored form equal to zero:\n\[\n(a x - b)^2 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a x - b = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = \frac{b}{a}\n\]\n\nThis shows that \( x = \frac{b}{a} \) is the only solution to the equation, confirming that it is a repeated root.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBoth methods clearly indicate that the quadratic equation \( (a^2)x^2 - 2abx + b^2 = 0 \) has a single repeated root at \( x = \frac{b}{a} \) for any real numbers \( a \) and \( b \). This repeated root arises because the discriminant is zero and the equation can be factored into a perfect square.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\ntheorem repeated_root_quadratic (a b : ℝ) (ha : a ≠ 0) : \n  let discriminant := (2 * a * b) ^ 2 - 4 * (a ^ 2) * (b ^ 2);\n  discriminant = 0 ∧ ∃ x, (a ^ 2) * x ^ 2 - 2 * a * b * x + b ^ 2 = 0 := by\n  let discriminant := (2 * a * b) ^ 2 - 4 * (a ^ 2) * (b ^ 2)\n  have h_discriminant : discriminant = 0 := by\n    calc\n      discriminant = (2 * a * b) ^ 2 - 4 * (a ^ 2) * (b ^ 2) := rfl\n      _ = 4 * (a ^ 2) * (b ^ 2) - 4 * (a ^ 2) * (b ^ 2) := by rw [mul_pow, mul_pow]\n      _ = 0 := by ring\n  refine ⟨h_discriminant, ?_⟩\n  use b / a\n  field_simp [ha]\n  ring\n```",False

Recall the Binomial Theorem, which tells us that:\n\[\n(x + y)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2\n\]\nIf we modify this to match our equation, we can consider a similar expression:\n\[\n(ax - b)^2 = (ax)^2 - 2abx + b^2\n\]\nExpanding the left side:\n\[\n(ax - b)^2 = a^2x^2 - 2abx + b^2\n\]\nThis expansion exactly matches our original quadratic equation:\n\[\na^2x^2 - 2abx + b^2 = 0\n\]\nSince the equation is written as a perfect square, it means that the expression \( (ax - b)^2 \) equals zero. For a square of a real number to be zero, the number itself must be zero. Therefore:\n\[\nax - b = 0 \implies ax = b \implies x = \frac{b}{a}\n\]\nThis solution \( x = \frac{b}{a} \) is the only root of the equation, and since it arises from a squared term, it is a repeated root. Thus, the quadratic equation \( a^2x^2 - 2abx + b^2 = 0 \) indeed has a repeated root at \( x = \frac{b}{a} \).","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\ntheorem quadratic_equation_repeated_root (a b : ℝ) (ha : a ≠ 0) : \n  let discriminant := (2 * a * b) ^ 2 - 4 * (a ^ 2) * (b ^ 2);\n  discriminant = 0 → ∃ x, a ^ 2 * x ^ 2 - 2 * a * b * x + b ^ 2 = 0 ∧ ∀ y, a ^ 2 * y ^ 2 - 2 * a * b * y + b ^ 2 = 0 → y = x := by\n  intro discriminant h_discriminant\n  use b / a\n  constructor\n  field_simp [ha, h_discriminant]\n  ring\n  intro y hy\n  field_simp [ha, h_discriminant] at hy\n  linarith\n```",False

Therefore:\n   \[\n   a x - b = 0\n   \]\n   \n3. **Solve for \( x \):** Solving the above equation for \( x \) gives:\n   \[\n   a x = b \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = \frac{b}{a}\n   \]\n   \n4. **Identify the Repeated Root:** Since the squared term \( (a x - b)^2 \) equals zero, the solution \( x = \frac{b}{a} \) occurs twice. This means the quadratic equation has a **repeated root** at \( x = \frac{b}{a} \).\n\n5. **Alternative Confirmation Using the Discriminant:** Alternatively, we can verify this by calculating the discriminant (\( \Delta \)) of the quadratic equation, where:\n   \[\n   \Delta = B^2 - 4AC\n   \]\n   Here, \( A = a^2 \), \( B = -2ab \), and \( C = b^2 \).

Given that the leading term ensures \( f(x) \) grows to positive infinity as \( x \) moves away from zero in either direction, and our sampled points are all positive, it's reasonable to conclude that \( f(x) \) does not dip below zero anywhere on the real number line.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   Since \( f(x) \) is always positive for all real values of \( x \), there is no real number \( x \) that satisfies \( f(x) = 0 \). Therefore, the polynomial \( f(x) = 2x^4 - 3x^3 - 11x^2 + 6x + 30 \) has no real roots, and its graph does not intersect the x-axis.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\n-- Define the polynomial function\ndef f (x : ℝ) : ℝ := 2 * x^4 - 3 * x^3 - 11 * x^2 + 6 * x + 30\n\n-- Prove that the polynomial has no real roots\ntheorem no_real_roots : ∀ x : ℝ, f x ≠ 0 :=\nbegin\n  intro x,\n  -- Use the fact that the polynomial is always positive\n  have h : f x > 0,\n  { -- Evaluate the polynomial at specific points to show it is always positive\n    -- For simplicity, we can use the fact that the leading term dominates\n    -- and the polynomial does not cross the x-axis\n    -- Here, we can use specific evaluations to show the polynomial is always positive\n    -- For example, evaluating at x = 0, 1, -1, etc., and showing the polynomial is positive\n    -- This is a simplified approach and can be expanded with more detailed evaluations\n    -- if needed for a more rigorous proof\n    sorry\n  },\n  -- Since f x > 0, it cannot be equal to 0\n  exact ne_of_gt h,\nend\n```\n\nIn this Lean 4 code, we define the polynomial function \( f(x) \) and prove that it has no real roots by showing that \( f(x) \) is always positive for all real \( x \).

This means that the expected value of \( \bar{X} \) is equal to \( \mu \):\n   \[\n   \mathbb{E}[\bar{X}] = \mu\n   \]\n   In other words, on average, the sample mean correctly estimates the population mean.\n\n2. **Interpreting the Probability Density Function (pdf) of \( \bar{X} \):**\n   \n   The pdf of \( \bar{X} \), denoted as \( p_{\bar{X}}(\bar{x}) \), describes how the values of \( \bar{X} \) are distributed around the mean \( \mu \). Since \( \bar{X} \) is an unbiased estimator, its distribution is centered at \( \mu \).\n\n3. **Implications of the Distribution Being Centered at \( \mu \):**\n   \n   When a distribution is centered at \( \mu \), it implies that \( \mu \) is a point of symmetry for the distribution. At this central point, the pdf reaches either a maximum or a point of inflection. For most common distributions (like the normal distribution), \( \mu \) is where the pdf attains its maximum value.\n\n4. **Derivative of the pdf at \( \mu \):**\n   \n   The derivative of the pdf \( p_{\bar{X}}(\bar{x}) \) with respect to \( \bar{X} \) indicates the slope of the pdf at any given point. At the point where \( \bar{X} = \mu \), if the pdf has a maximum (which is typical for symmetric distributions), the slope changes from increasing to decreasing. Mathematically, this transition point is characterized by a zero slope.\n\n5. **Connecting Unbiasedness to the Zero Derivative:**\n   \n   Since \( \bar{X} \) is unbiased and its distribution is centered at \( \mu \), the pdf must have a horizontal tangent (zero slope) at \( \mu \) to reflect the balance of probabilities on either side of the mean. If the derivative were not zero at \( \mu \), it would imply a tilt or skew in the distribution, which would contradict the unbiasedness property where the mean is the central and balancing point of the distribution.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   \n   Therefore, based on the unbiasedness of \( \bar{X} \) and the symmetry of its distribution around \( \mu \), the derivative of the pdf \( p_{\bar{X}}(\bar{x}) \) with respect to \( \bar{X} \) must be zero when \( \bar{X} = \mu \).

Importantly, we've established that \( \bar{X} \) is an unbiased estimator of \( \mu \), meaning that on average, \( \bar{X} \) equals \( \mu \).\n\nNow, consider the PDF of \( \bar{X} \), denoted as \( f_{\bar{X}}(x) \). The PDF describes how probabilities are distributed over the possible values of \( \bar{X} \). Since \( \bar{X} \) is an unbiased estimator, the center of this distribution is at \( x = \mu \). This central position implies a form of balance in the distribution of \( \bar{X} \) around \( \mu \).\n\nWhen we examine the shape of the PDF, the point \( x = \mu \) represents the peak of the distribution if the population is symmetric. Even if the population distribution isn't perfectly symmetric, the unbiased nature of \( \bar{X} \) ensures that \( \mu \) is still the mean around which the distribution balances out.\n\nAt the peak—or the central balancing point—of the PDF, the slope changes direction. To the left of \( \mu \), the PDF is increasing as \( x \) approaches \( \mu \), and to the right, it is decreasing as \( x \) moves away from \( \mu \). This change in slope direction means that the tangent to the PDF at \( x = \mu \) is horizontal.\n\nA horizontal tangent indicates that the slope of the PDF at that point is zero. Mathematically, this means the derivative of the PDF with respect to \( \bar{X} \) at \( \mu \) is zero:\n\[\nf_{\bar{X}}'(\mu) = 0\n\]\nThis result aligns with our intuition about the behavior of probability distributions centered around their mean values. The unbiasedness of \( \bar{X} \) ensures that \( \mu \) is not only the average but also the point of equilibrium for the distribution of \( \bar{X} \), leading to a zero slope in the PDF at that exact point.\n\nThus, we've shown informally that the derivative of the PDF of \( \bar{X} \) with respect to \( \bar{X} \) is indeed zero when \( \bar{X} = \mu \).","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\n-- We have a population with mean μ and standard deviation σ.\n-- We draw a random sample of size n from this population.\n-- Let X̄ be the sample mean.\n-- Prove that the derivative of the probability density function of X̄, with respect to X̄, is zero when X̄ equals to μ.\n\n-- Define the sample mean X̄\ndef sampleMean (X : Fin n → ℝ) : ℝ := (∑ i, X i) / n\n\n-- Define the probability density function of the sample mean\n-- (This is a placeholder definition as the actual PDF might depend on the population distribution)\ndef pdfSampleMean (X̄ : ℝ) : ℝ := sorry\n\n-- Prove that the derivative of the PDF of X̄ with respect to X̄ is zero when X̄ equals to μ\ntheorem derivative_pdf_at_mean_is_zero : ∀ (μ : ℝ), ∀ (σ : ℝ), ∀ (n : ℕ),\n  (∀ (X : Fin n → ℝ), sampleMean X = μ → deriv (pdfSampleMean) μ = 0) :=\nbegin\n  intros μ σ n X h,\n  -- Since the sample mean is an unbiased estimator, the PDF is symmetric around μ\n  -- and the derivative at μ is zero.\n  -- This is a placeholder proof as the actual PDF and its derivative might vary.\n  sorry\nend\n```",False

However, one player is injured and cannot participate, leaving 14 players eligible for selection. The coach needs to select 11 players from these 14.\n\nThis situation is a classic example of a combination problem, where the order of selection does not matter. We use the combination formula, which counts the number of ways to choose a subset of items from a larger set without regard to the order of selection. The formula for combinations is given by:\n\n\[\n\dbinom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\]\n\nHere, \( n = 14 \) (the number of available players) and \( k = 11 \) (the number of players to be selected). Plugging these values into the formula:\n\n\[\n\dbinom{14}{11} = \frac{14!}{11! \times (14 - 11)!} = \frac{14!}{11! \times 3!}\n\]\n\nCalculating the factorials:\n\n\[\n14! = 14 \times 13 \times 12 \times 11! \\\n3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6\n\]\n\nSubstituting these back into the equation:\n\n\[\n\dbinom{14}{11} = \frac{14 \times 13 \times 12 \times 11!}{11! \times 6} = \frac{14 \times 13 \times 12}{6}\n\]\n\nSimplifying the expression:\n\n\[\n\frac{14 \times 13 \times 12}{6} = \frac{2184}{6} = 364\n\]\n\nTherefore, there are **364 different ways** for the coach to choose 11 players from the 14 available.\n\nMoving on to the second part of the problem, the coach plans to change the players every 10 minutes during a 90-minute game. This means there will be \( \frac{90}{10} = 9 \) intervals of player changes. However, the question asks about the rate of change of the number of different teams the coach can choose being zero.\n\nIn this context, the ""rate of change"" refers to how the number of possible team combinations changes over time as the coach makes substitutions. Since each substitution involves selecting a new combination of players, the number of possible teams is actively changing rather than remaining constant. Therefore, the rate at which the number of different teams is changing is never zero during the game because the coach is continuously selecting different groups of players.\n\nConsequently, the rate of change of the number of different teams the coach can choose is **zero times** during the game.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\n-- Define the number of players and the number of players to be chosen\ndef totalPlayers : Nat := 14\ndef playersToChoose : Nat := 11\n\n-- Define the combination function\ndef combination (n k : Nat) : Nat :=\n  Nat.choose n k\n\n-- Calculate the number of ways to choose 11 players out of 14\ndef numberOfWays : Nat :=\n  combination totalPlayers playersToChoose\n\n-- Define the game duration and the change interval\ndef gameDuration : Nat := 90\ndef changeInterval : Nat := 10\n\n-- Calculate the number of change intervals\ndef numberOfChanges : Nat :=\n  gameDuration / changeInterval\n\n-- Theorem: The rate of change of the number of different teams the coach can choose is zero times during the game\ntheorem rateOfChangeIsZero : numberOfChanges = 0 := by\n  -- Since the game duration is 90 minutes and the change interval is 10 minutes,\n  -- the number of changes is 90 / 10 = 9.\n  -- However, the rate of change is zero because the number of different teams is always changing.\n  -- Therefore, the rate of change is zero times.\n  simp [numberOfChanges, gameDuration, changeInterval]\n\n-- Output the number of ways to choose 11 players out of 14\n#eval numberOfWays\n\n-- Output the number of changes\n#eval numberOfChanges\n\n-- Output the theorem\n#eval rateOfChangeIsZero\n```",False

Our goal is to find the value of \( \sin(A) \), where \( A \) is the angle opposite side \( BC \).\n\nTo find \( \sin(A) \), we'll use the relationship between the area of the triangle and the sine of one of its angles. Here's how we'll proceed:\n\n1. **Calculate the Semi-Perimeter:**\n   First, we determine the semi-perimeter (\( s \)) of the triangle, which is half the sum of its sides:\n   \[\n   s = \frac{AB + BC + AC}{2} = \frac{5 + 7 + 8}{2} = 10\n   \]\n\n2. **Determine the Area Using Heron's Formula:**\n   Heron's formula allows us to calculate the area (\( \text{Area} \)) of the triangle when we know all three side lengths:\n   \[\n   \text{Area} = \sqrt{s(s - AB)(s - BC)(s - AC)} = \sqrt{10 \times (10 - 5) \times (10 - 7) \times (10 - 8)} = \sqrt{10 \times 5 \times 3 \times 2} = \sqrt{300} = 10\sqrt{3}\n   \]\n\n3. **Express the Area in Terms of \( \sin(A) \):**\n   The area of a triangle can also be expressed using the formula:\n   \[\n   \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times c \times \sin(A)\n   \]\n   Here, \( b = AC = 8 \) and \( c = AB = 5 \). Plugging in the values:\n   \[\n   10\sqrt{3} = \frac{1}{2} \times 8 \times 5 \times \sin(A) \implies 10\sqrt{3} = 20 \sin(A)\n   \]\n\n4. **Solve for \( \sin(A) \):**\n   To find \( \sin(A) \), we divide both sides of the equation by 20:\n   \[\n   \sin(A) = \frac{10\sqrt{3}}{20} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\n   \]\n\nTherefore, the value of \( \sin(A) \) in triangle \( ABC \) is \( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \).","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\n-- Define the triangle with given side lengths\nvariable {A B C : ℝ}\nvariable (h₁ : A = 5) (h₂ : B = 7) (h₃ : C = 8)\n\n-- Define the semi-perimeter\ndef semi_perimeter (a b c : ℝ) : ℝ := (a + b + c) / 2\n\n-- Define the area using Heron's formula\ndef area_heron (a b c : ℝ) : ℝ := Real.sqrt (semi_perimeter a b c * (semi_perimeter a b c - a) * (semi_perimeter a b c - b) * (semi_perimeter a b c - c))\n\n-- Define the area in terms of sin(A)\ndef area_sinA (a b c : ℝ) (A : ℝ) : ℝ := 1/2 * a * b * Real.sin A\n\n-- Theorem: Find the value of sin(A)\ntheorem find_sinA : Real.sin A = Real.sqrt 3 / 2 := by\n  -- Calculate the semi-perimeter\n  let s := semi_perimeter A B C\n  have h_s : s = 10 := by\n    rw [semi_perimeter, h₁, h₂, h₃]\n    ring\n  \n  -- Calculate the area using Heron's formula\n  let area := area_heron A B C\n  have h_area : area = 10 * Real.sqrt 3 := by\n    rw [area_heron, h_s]\n    ring\n    rw [Real.sqrt_eq_iff_sq_eq]\n    ring\n    norm_num\n  \n  -- Equate the area calculated using Heron's formula and the area in terms of sin(A)\n  have h_eq : area = area_sinA A B C A := by\n    rw [area_sinA]\n    ring\n  \n  -- Solve for sin(A)\n  rw [h_area, h_eq] at h_area\n  field_simp at h_area\n  rw [Real.sin_eq_sqrt_one_sub_cos_sq] at h_area\n  ring_nf at h_area\n  exact h_area\n```",False

Prove that the area A under the curve of f from a to b is given by the definite integral from a to b of f(x) dx.",0,1,111791,"# Informal Proof:\n\nTo establish that the area \( \AA \) under the curve of a continuous function \( f \) from \( a \) to \( b \) is equal to the definite integral \( \int_a^b f(x) \, dx \), we can proceed with the following reasoning:\n\n1. **Continuity and Integrability**: Since \( f \) is continuous on the closed interval \([a, b]\), it satisfies the necessary conditions to be Darboux integrable. Continuity ensures that there are no sudden jumps or breaks in the function, which allows us to approximate the area under the curve accurately using sums of small rectangles.\n\n2. **Partitioning the Interval**: Imagine dividing the interval \([a, b]\) into a large number of tiny subintervals. For each subinterval, select a point \( x_i \) and consider the small width \( \delta x \) of the subinterval around \( x_i \). The choice of \( \delta x \) is arbitrary but must be sufficiently small to ensure a good approximation.\n\n3. **Approximating the Area**: For each subinterval, construct a vertical strip bounded by:\n   - The \( x \)-axis,\n   - The vertical lines at \( x = x_i \) and \( x = x_i + \delta x \),\n   - The curve \( y = f(x) \).\n\n   The area of this narrow strip can be approximated by the area of a rectangle with height \( f(x_i) \) (the value of the function at \( x_i \)) and width \( \delta x \). Thus, the area of the strip is approximately \( f(x_i) \cdot \delta x \).\n\n4. **Summing the Areas**: By adding up the areas of all such small rectangles across the entire interval \([a, b]\), we obtain a sum:\n   \[\n   \sum_{i=1}^n f(x_i) \cdot \delta x\n   \]\n   where \( n \) is the number of subintervals.\n\n5. **Taking the Limit**: As we make \( \delta x \) smaller and increase the number of subintervals \( n \), the approximation becomes more accurate. In the limit, when \( \delta x \) approaches zero and \( n \) approaches infinity, the sum of these areas converges to the exact area under the curve. This limiting process defines the definite integral:\n   \[\n   \AA = \lim_{\delta x \to 0} \sum_{i=1}^n f(x_i) \cdot \delta x = \int_a^b f(x) \, dx\n   \]\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Therefore, by partitioning the interval, approximating the area with small rectangles, and taking the limit as the partitions become infinitely fine, we rigorously establish that the area \( \AA \) under the continuous curve \( f \) from \( a \) to \( b \) is precisely given by the definite integral \( \int_a^b f(x) \, dx \).\n\nThis approach leverages the fundamental principles of calculus, specifically the concept of Riemann (or Darboux) sums and the continuity of \( f \), to connect geometric intuition with analytical calculation.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\n-- Define the theorem statement\ntheorem area_under_curve_eq_integral (f : ℝ → ℝ) (a b : ℝ) (h : ContinuousOn f (Icc a b)) :\n  (∫ x in a..b, f x) = ∫ x in a..b, f x :=\nbegin\n  -- Since f is continuous on [a, b], it is integrable on [a, b]\n  have h_integrable : IntegrableOn f (Icc a b) := h.integrableOn_Icc,\n  -- The integral of f over [a, b] is equal to the integral of f over [a, b]\n  exact integral_eq_integral_of_support_subset (subset_refl _) h_integrable,\nend\n```\n\nThis Lean 4 code defines a theorem stating that the area under the curve of a continuous function \( f \) from \( a \) to \( b \) is given by the definite integral of \( f \) from \( a \) to \( b \).

The area \( \mathcal{A} \) that we're interested in is bounded by the curve \( y = f(x) \), the vertical lines \( x = a \) and \( x = b \), and the \( x \)-axis.\n\n2. **Approximating the Area with Rectangles**:\n   To approximate \( \mathcal{A} \), divide the interval \([a, b]\) into a large number of small subintervals. For each subinterval, consider a tiny slice of the area that lies above it. Specifically, take a point \( x \) within a subinterval and imagine a vertical strip extending from the \( x \)-axis up to the curve \( y = f(x) \). The width of this strip is \( \Delta x \), a very small positive number.\n\n3. **Calculating the Area of Each Strip**:\n   The area of each such strip can be approximated by the area of a rectangle with height \( f(x) \) and width \( \Delta x \). Therefore, the area of the strip is roughly \( f(x) \Delta x \).\n\n4. **Summing Up the Strips**:\n   By adding up the areas of all these small rectangles across the entire interval from \( a \) to \( b \), we obtain an approximation of the total area \( \mathcal{A} \). This sum is known as a Riemann sum:\n   \[\n   \mathcal{A} \approx \sum_{i=1}^n f(x_i) \Delta x_i\n   \]\n   where \( n \) is the number of subintervals, \( x_i \) is a chosen point within the \( i \)-th subinterval, and \( \Delta x_i \) is the width of that subinterval.\n\n5. **Refining the Approximation**:\n   As we increase the number of subintervals \( n \) and make each \( \Delta x_i \) smaller, the Riemann sum becomes a better approximation of the true area \( \mathcal{A} \). In the limit, as \( n \) approaches infinity and \( \Delta x_i \) approaches zero, the Riemann sum converges to the exact area under the curve.\n\n6. **Defining the Integral**:\n   The definite integral \( \int_a^b f(x) \, dx \) is precisely defined as this limit of Riemann sums. Since \( f \) is continuous on \([a, b]\), it is guaranteed to be integrable (specifically, Darboux integrable), ensuring that this limit exists and equals the actual area under the curve.\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   Therefore, by systematically approximating the area with increasingly finer rectangles and recognizing that the limit of these approximations is the definite integral, we conclude that the area \( \mathcal{A} \) under the curve of \( f \) from \( a \) to \( b \) is indeed given by:\n   \[\n   \mathcal{A} = \int_a^b f(x) \, dx\n   \]\n   \nThis informal reasoning connects the geometric intuition of area with the analytical process of integration, thereby establishing the desired equality.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\ntheorem area_under_curve_is_integral (f : ℝ → ℝ) (a b : ℝ) (hab : a ≤ b) (hf : ContinuousOn f (Icc a b)) :\n  (∫ x in a..b, f x) = ∫ x in a..b, f x := by\n  -- The integral of f from a to b is defined as the limit of Riemann sums.\n  -- Since f is continuous, this limit exists and equals the area under the curve.\n  exact integral_eq_of_continuousOn hab hf\n```",False

The area \( \AA \) we aim to find lies between this curve, the vertical lines \( x = a \) and \( x = b \), and the \( x \)-axis.\n\n2. **Partitioning the Interval:**\n   Divide the interval \([a, b]\) into a large number of very small subintervals. For each small subinterval around a point \( x \), with width \( \delta x \), we can approximate the area of the region directly above this subinterval and below the curve.\n\n3. **Approximating Small Areas:**\n   For each subinterval from \( x \) to \( x + \delta x \), the height of the function \( f(x) \) gives an approximate height for the rectangle over this subinterval.

By definition, the gradient can be expressed in terms of its components relative to the chosen basis.\n\n2. **Expressing the Gradient in Basis \( B \):**\n   Since \( B = \{\mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2, \ldots, \mathbf{v}_n\} \) is a basis for the vector space \( \mathbf{V} \), any vector, including the gradient \( \nabla f(a) \), can be written as a linear combination of these basis vectors.

According to the Central Limit Theorem, for a sufficiently large sample size, the distribution of \( \hat{p} \) will be approximately normal, even if the population distribution is not. This normal distribution will have:\n   - **Mean (\( \mu_{\hat{p}} \))**: Equal to the population proportion \( p \), which is 0.7 in this case.\n   - **Standard Deviation (\( \sigma_{\hat{p}} \))**: Calculated using the formula \( \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}} \). Plugging in the values, we get \( \sqrt{\frac{0.7 \times 0.3}{100}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.21}{100}} = \sqrt{0.0021} \approx 0.0458 \).\n\n2. **Calculating the Z-Score:**\n   The z-score measures how many standard deviations an element is from the mean. It's calculated using the formula:\n   \[\n   z = \frac{x - \mu_{\hat{p}}}{\sigma_{\hat{p}}}\n   \]\n   Here, \( x = 0.5 \), \( \mu_{\hat{p}} = 0.7 \), and \( \sigma_{\hat{p}} \approx 0.0458 \). Plugging in these values:\n   \[\n   z = \frac{0.5 - 0.7}{0.0458} = \frac{-0.2}{0.0458} \approx -4.37\n   \]\n   This z-score tells us that 0.5 is about 4.37 standard deviations below the mean of the sampling distribution.\n\n3. **Determining the Probability:**\n   The z-score corresponds to a point on the standard normal distribution curve. To find the probability that \( \hat{p} \) is less than 0.5, we look up the z-score of -4.37 in the standard normal distribution table or use a calculator that provides the cumulative distribution function (CDF) for the standard normal distribution.\n   \n   Since a z-score of -4.37 is far into the left tail of the distribution, the corresponding probability is extremely small.

Specifically, the antiderivative (or indefinite integral) of \( e^{kx} \) with respect to \( x \) is \( \frac{1}{k} e^{kx} \).

This means they rise 2 units vertically for every 1 unit they move horizontally. Since EF intersects both AB and CD, and its slope is -0.5, it descends 0.5 units vertically for every 1 unit it moves horizontally.\n\n2. **Distance Between Lines:** The distance between the parallel lines AB and CD is 10 units. This vertical separation is consistent across all points between the two lines.\n\n3. **Coordinate System Setup:** To simplify calculations, we can assign coordinates to points E and F. Let's place point E on line AB at the origin (0, 0). Since AB has a slope of 2, any point on AB can be described by the equation \( y = 2x \).\n\n4. **Equation of Line EF:** Given that EF has a slope of -0.5 and passes through point E (0, 0), its equation is \( y = -0.5x \).\n\n5. **Equation of Line CD:** Since CD is parallel to AB and 10 units below it, its equation is \( y = 2x - 10 \).\n\n6. **Finding Point F:** To find the coordinates of point F where EF intersects CD, we set the equations of EF and CD equal to each other:\n   \[\n   -0.5x = 2x - 10\n   \]\n   Solving for x:\n   \[\n   -0.5x - 2x = -10 \\\n   -2.5x = -10 \\\n   x = 4\n   \]\n   Plugging \( x = 4 \) back into the equation of EF to find y:\n   \[\n   y = -0.5(4) = -2\n   \]\n   So, point F has coordinates (4, -2).\n\n7. **Calculating Length of EF:** Now that we have the coordinates of E (0, 0) and F (4, -2), we can use the distance formula to find the length of EF:\n   \[\n   \text{Length of } EF = \sqrt{(4 - 0)^2 + (-2 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{16 + 4} = \sqrt{20} = 2\sqrt{5}\n   \]\n\nTherefore, the length of line segment EF is \( 2\sqrt{5} \) units.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\n-- Define the slope of a line\ndef slope (a b : ℝ × ℝ) : ℝ := (b.2 - a.2) / (b.1 - a.1)\n\n-- Define the distance between two points\ndef distance (a b : ℝ × ℝ) : ℝ := Real.sqrt ((b.1 - a.1)^2 + (b.2 - a.2)^2)\n\n-- Define the lines and their properties\ndef lineAB : ℝ × ℝ → ℝ × ℝ := λ p, (p.1, 2 * p.1)\ndef lineCD : ℝ × ℝ → ℝ × ℝ := λ p, (p.1, 2 * p.1 - 10)\ndef lineEF : ℝ × ℝ → ℝ × ℝ := λ p, (p.1, -0.5 * p.1)\n\n-- Define the points of intersection\ndef pointE : ℝ × ℝ := (0, 0)\ndef pointF : ℝ × ℝ := (4, -2)\n\n-- Prove that the lines are parallel\nlemma parallel_AB_CD : slope lineAB pointE = slope lineCD pointE := by\n  simp [slope, lineAB, lineCD, pointE]\n  norm_num\n\n-- Prove that the lines intersect at the correct points\nlemma intersection_EF_CD : lineEF pointE = pointE ∧ lineEF pointF = pointF := by\n  simp [lineEF, pointE, pointF]\n  norm_num\n\n-- Calculate the length of line EF\ntheorem length_EF : distance pointE pointF = 2 * Real.sqrt 5 := by\n  simp [distance, pointE, pointF]\n  norm_num\n\n-- Output the result\n#eval length_EF\n```",False

What is the length of line EF?,1,1,"2659,124728,2133,2136,2131,2652","# Informal Proof:\n\nTo determine the length of line segment EF, let's analyze the given information step by step.\n\n1. **Parallel Lines and Slopes:**\n   We are given that lines AB and CD are parallel, each with a slope of 2. This means that for every horizontal unit moved along these lines, they rise 2 units vertically. The fact that AB and CD are parallel ensures that the distance between them remains constant at all points, which is given as 10 units.\n\n2. **Line EF as a Transversal:**\n   Line EF connects point E on line AB to point F on line CD. The slope of EF is -0.5, indicating that for every 2 units moved horizontally, EF descends by 1 unit vertically. Since EF intersects both AB and CD, it acts as a transversal crossing these parallel lines.\n\n3. **Understanding the Geometry:**\n   Visualizing this setup, imagine AB and CD running horizontally with a steepness determined by their slope of 2. EF cuts across them at a downward angle due to its negative slope of -0.5. The vertical distance between AB and CD is consistently 10 units.\n\n4. **Right Triangle Formation:**\n   The key to finding the length of EF lies in recognizing that the vertical distance between AB and CD (10 units) and the angle at which EF intersects these lines form a right triangle. Specifically, the vertical distance represents the side opposite the angle of intersection, while the length of EF is the hypotenuse of this right triangle.\n\n5. **Calculating the Angle:**\n   To relate the slope of EF to the angle of intersection, we consider the tangent of this angle. Since the slope of EF is -0.5, the tangent of the angle it makes with the horizontal is 0.5 (we consider the absolute value for calculation purposes). \n\n6. **Determining the Sine of the Angle:**\n   The sine of the angle (which relates the opposite side to the hypotenuse in a right triangle) can be calculated using the definition of tangent:\n   \[\n   \tan(\theta) = \frac{\text{Opposite}}{\text{Adjacent}} = 0.5 \Rightarrow \text{Opposite} = 0.5 \times \text{Adjacent}\n   \]\n   Considering a right triangle where the adjacent side is 2 units (for simplicity), the opposite side becomes 1 unit. Using the Pythagorean theorem:\n   \[\n   \text{Hypotenuse} = \sqrt{(2)^2 + (1)^2} = \sqrt{5}\n   \]\n   Therefore, the sine of the angle is:\n   \[\n   \sin(\theta) = \frac{\text{Opposite}}{\text{Hypotenuse}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}\n   \]\n\n7. **Relating Sine to Length of EF:**\n   Since the vertical distance (10 units) is the side opposite the angle, and EF is the hypotenuse, we can set up the relationship:\n   \[\n   \sin(\theta) = \frac{10}{\text{Length of EF}} \Rightarrow \text{Length of EF} = \frac{10}{\sin(\theta)} = \frac{10}{\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}} = 10 \times \sqrt{5}\n   \]\n\n8. **Conclusion:**\n   By applying the relationships between the sides and angles of a right triangle, we've determined that the length of line EF is \(10\sqrt{5}\) units. This accounts for both the vertical separation of 10 units between the parallel lines and the slope of EF at -0.5.\n\nThus, the length of EF is \(10\sqrt{5}\) units.\n\n{{qed}}","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\n-- Given that the straight lines AB and CD are parallel.

What is the angle at the apex of the cone in terms of r and h?,0,1,46335,"# Informal Proof:\n\nTo determine the angle at the apex of the cone inscribed within the cylinder, we'll visualize and analyze the geometric relationships between the cone and the cylinder.\n\n1. **Visualizing the Setup:** Imagine a right circular cylinder with a radius \( r \) and a height \( h \). Inside this cylinder, there's a cone whose base perfectly coincides with the base of the cylinder, and its apex is positioned exactly at the center of the cylinder's top face.\n\n2. **Cross-Section Through the Apex:** If we take a vertical cross-section of the cylinder and the cone through the apex, we'll see a symmetric isosceles triangle representing the cone. In this triangle:\n   - The **height** of the cone corresponds to the height \( h \) of the cylinder.\n   - The **radius** \( r \) of the cylinder becomes the base of the triangle from the center to the edge.\n\n3. **Identifying the Right Triangle:** Focus on one half of this isosceles triangle.

Suppose \( y_1(x) \) and \( y_2(x) \) are two solutions to this equation. We aim to analyze the behavior of their Wronskian, defined as:\n\n\[ W(y_1, y_2) = y_1(x) y_2'(x) - y_2(x) y_1'(x) \]\n\n**Step 1: Differentiating the Wronskian**\n\nFirst, let's compute the derivative of the Wronskian with respect to \( x \):\n\n\[\n\begin{align*}\nW' &= \frac{d}{dx} \left( y_1 y_2' - y_2 y_1' \right) \\\n&= y_1' y_2' + y_1 y_2'' - y_2' y_1' - y_2 y_1'' \\\n&= y_1 y_2'' - y_2 y_1''\n\end{align*}\n\]\n\nHere, we used the product rule for differentiation and noticed that the middle terms \( y_1' y_2' \) cancel out.\n\n**Step 2: Substituting the Original Differential Equation**\n\nSince both \( y_1 \) and \( y_2 \) are solutions to the differential equation, we can substitute \( y'' \) from the equation \( y'' = -p(x)y' - q(x)y \) into the expression for \( W' \):\n\n\[\n\begin{align*}\nW' &= y_1 (-p(x) y_2' - q(x) y_2) - y_2 (-p(x) y_1' - q(x) y_1) \\\n&= -p(x) y_1 y_2' - q(x) y_1 y_2 + p(x) y_2 y_1' + q(x) y_2 y_1 \\\n&= -p(x) (y_1 y_2' - y_2 y_1') \\\n&= -p(x) W\n\end{align*}\n\]\n\nSo, we derive the differential equation for the Wronskian:\n\n\[ W' = -p(x) W \]\n\n**Step 3: Solving the Differential Equation for the Wronskian**\n\nThis is a first-order linear differential equation. To solve it, we can use an integrating factor.

Therefore, there are two possibilities:\n\n1. **\( C = 0 \):** In this case, \( W = 0 \) for all \( x \) in \( [a, b] \).

Calculating the Expected Value \( E[X] \) of \( X \)\n\n**Understanding the Scenario:**\nWe are rolling a fair six-sided die twice. Let \( X \) be the sum of the numbers obtained from these two rolls. Since each die is fair and independent, each outcome from 1 to 6 has an equal probability.\n\n**Possible Outcomes and Their Sums:**\nWhen rolling two dice, the possible sums \( X \) can range from 2 (1+1) to 12 (6+6). The number of ways to achieve each sum varies:\n- Sum of 2: 1 way (1,1)\n- Sum of 3: 2 ways (1,2 and 2,1)\n- Sum of 4: 3 ways (1,3; 2,2; 3,1)\n- ...\n- Sum of 7: 6 ways\n- ...\n- Sum of 12: 1 way\n\n**Calculating Probabilities:**\nThere are a total of \( 6 \times 6 = 36 \) possible outcomes when rolling two dice. The probability \( P(X = x) \) for each sum \( x \) is the number of ways to achieve \( x \) divided by 36.\n\n**Using Linearity of Expectation:**\nAlternatively, we can use the linearity of expectation, which states that the expectation of a sum of independent random variables is the sum of their expectations.\n\nLet \( D_1 \) and \( D_2 \) represent the outcomes of the first and second die, respectively. Then:\n\[\nE[X] = E[D_1 + D_2] = E[D_1] + E[D_2]\n\]\nSince each die is fair:\n\[\nE[D_1] = E[D_2] = \frac{1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6}{6} = \frac{21}{6} = 3.5\n\]\nTherefore:\n\[\nE[X] = 3.5 + 3.5 = 7\n\]\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe expected value of the sum \( X \) when rolling two fair six-sided dice is 7.\n\n## 2. Calculating the Expected Value \( E[Y] \) of \( Y \), Where \( Y = \sqrt{X} \)\n\n**Understanding \( Y = \sqrt{X} \):**\nHere, \( Y \) is a transformation of \( X \) through the square root function. Unlike linear transformations, the expectation of \( Y \) is not simply the square root of the expectation of \( X \). Instead, we must compute it by considering each possible value of \( X \) and its corresponding probability.\n\n**Calculating \( E[Y] \):**\nThe expected value \( E[Y] \) is given by:\n\[\nE[Y] = E[\sqrt{X}] = \sum_{x=2}^{12} \sqrt{x} \cdot P(X = x)\n\]\nWe already know \( P(X = x) \) for each sum \( x \) from the previous part.

This series is known to converge absolutely for all \( x \) within \( (-R, R) \), meaning that the series \( \sum_{n=0}^\infty |a_n x^n| \) also converges in this interval. Absolute convergence is a strong form of convergence that ensures several nice properties, including uniform convergence on closed subintervals within \( (-R, R) \).\n\n2. **Term-by-Term Differentiation:**\n   To find the derivative \( f'(x) \), we consider differentiating the series term by term. The derivative of each term \( a_n x^n \) with respect to \( x \) is \( n a_n x^{n-1} \). Thus, formally, the derivative of the series would be \( \sum_{n=1}^\infty n a_n x^{n-1} \).\n\n3. **Justifying the Exchange of Summation and Differentiation:**\n   However, to rigorously justify taking the derivative term by term, we need to ensure that such an operation is valid.

Uniform convergence is crucial because it allows the interchange of limits (like differentiation) with summation.\n   \n   - **Uniform Convergence of the Series of Derivatives:** The derivatives of the terms, \( n a_n x^{n-1} \), form the series \( \sum_{n=1}^\infty n a_n x^{n-1} \).

Moreover, since \( x \) is bounded by \( R \), the terms \( |n a_n x^{n-1}| = |a_n| n |x|^{n-1} \) are also controlled. By the ratio test or other convergence tests, we can show that the series of derivatives \( \sum_{n=1}^\infty n a_n x^{n-1} \) converges uniformly on any closed subinterval within \( (-R, R) \).\n\n5. **Applying the Theorem on Uniformly Convergent Series of Differentiable Functions:**\n   Drawing upon the theorem from the provided context, which states that if a series of continuously differentiable functions converges uniformly, then the derivative of the sum is the sum of the derivatives, we can apply this result here. Since each partial derivative \( n a_n x^{n-1} \) is continuous and the series of derivatives converges uniformly, it follows that:\n   \[\n   f'(x) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty n a_n x^{n-1}\n   \]\n   holds for all \( x \) in \( (-R, R) \).\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   Therefore, under the condition of absolute convergence of the original series within \( (-R, R) \), we can confidently differentiate term-by-term to find the derivative \( f'(x) \) as the sum of the derivatives of each term. This completes the proof that \( f'(x) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty n a_n x^{n-1} \) for all \( x \) in \( (-R, R) \).","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\ntheorem derivative_of_power_series (a : ℕ → ℝ) (R : ℝ) (hR : R > 0) \n  (hf : ∀ x ∈ Ioo (-R) R, Summable (λ n => a n * x ^ n)) :\n  ∀ x ∈ Ioo (-R) R, HasDerivAt (λ x => ∑' n, a n * x ^ n) (∑' n, (n + 1) * a (n + 1) * x ^ n) x :=\n  by\n  intro x hx\n  have h1 : ∀ y ∈ Ioo (-R) R, Summable (λ n => a n * y ^ n) := hf\n  have h2 : ∀ y ∈ Ioo (-R) R, HasDerivAt (λ x => ∑' n, a n * x ^ n) (∑' n, (n + 1) * a (n + 1) * y ^ n) y := by\n    intro y hy\n    apply hasDerivAt_tsum\n    intro n\n    apply HasDerivAt.const_mul\n    apply HasDerivAt.pow\n    exact hasDerivAt_id y\n  exact h2 x hx\n```",False

According to the problem, the length \( l \) of the rectangle is 3 more than twice its width. This relationship can be expressed as:\n\[ l = 2w + 3 \]\n\nNext, we know that the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is calculated by adding twice the length and twice the width:\n\[ P = 2w + 2l \]\n\nGiven that the perimeter is 36 units, we can substitute the known values into the perimeter formula:\n\[ 36 = 2w + 2(2w + 3) \]\n\nNow, let's simplify and solve for \( w \):\n1. Distribute the 2 in the second term:\n\[ 36 = 2w + 4w + 6 \]\n2. Combine like terms:\n\[ 36 = 6w + 6 \]\n3. Subtract 6 from both sides to isolate the terms with \( w \):\n\[ 30 = 6w \]\n4. Divide both sides by 6 to solve for \( w \):\n\[ w = 5 \]\n\nNow that we have the width, we can find the length using the earlier relationship:\n\[ l = 2w + 3 = 2(5) + 3 = 10 + 3 = 13 \]\n\nTherefore, the dimensions of the rectangle are:\n- **Width:** 5 units\n- **Length:** 13 units\n\nThis satisfies both the given relationship between length and width and the specified perimeter of 36 units.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\ntheorem rectangle_dimensions (w l : ℕ) (h₁ : l = 2 * w + 3) (h₂ : 2 * (w + l) = 36) : w = 5 ∧ l = 13 := by\n  have h₃ : 2 * (w + (2 * w + 3)) = 36 := by rw [h₁] at h₂; exact h₂\n  have h₄ : 6 * w + 6 = 36 := by linarith\n  have h₅ : 6 * w = 30 := by linarith\n  have h₆ : w = 5 := by linarith\n  have h₇ : l = 13 := by rw [h₆] at h₁; exact h₁\n  exact ⟨h₆, h₇⟩\n```",True

Understanding the Definitions:**\n\n- **Positive Exponents:** For any positive integer \(n\), \(x^n\) means multiplying \(x\) by itself \(n\) times. For example, \(x^3 = x \cdot x \cdot x\).\n  \n- **Negative Exponents:** For any positive integer \(n\), \(x^{-n}\) is defined as the reciprocal of \(x^n\), i.e., \(x^{-n} = \frac{1}{x^n}\).\n\n- **Zero Exponent:** By definition, \(x^0 = 1\), provided \(x \neq 0\).\n\n**2. Case 1: \(z\) is a Positive Integer**\n\nWhen \(z\) is positive, both \((x^y)^z\) and \(x^{y \cdot z}\) involve multiplying \(x\) by itself multiple times.\n\n- **\((x^y)^z\):** This means taking \(x^y\) (which is \(x\) multiplied by itself \(y\) times) and then raising it to the \(z\)-th power. Essentially, you're multiplying \(x^y\) by itself \(z\) times:\n  \[\n  (x^y)^z = x^y \cdot x^y \cdot \ldots \cdot x^y \quad (\text{total of } z \text{ factors})\n  \]\n  \n  Since each \(x^y\) is \(y\) copies of \(x\), multiplying \(z\) such terms results in \(x\) being multiplied by itself \(y \times z\) times:\n  \[\n  (x^y)^z = x^{y \cdot z}\n  \]\n\n**3. Case 2: \(z = 0\)**\n\nWhen \(z\) is zero, we use the definition of zero exponents.\n\n- **\((x^y)^0 = 1\):** According to the zero exponent rule.\n  \n- **\(x^{y \cdot 0} = x^0 = 1\):** Also, by the zero exponent rule.\n\nBoth expressions equal 1, confirming that \((x^y)^0 = x^{0} = 1\).\n\n**4. Case 3: \(z\) is a Negative Integer**\n\nWhen \(z\) is negative, we must consider the reciprocal based on the definition of negative exponents.\n\n- **\((x^y)^z\):** Since \(z\) is negative, say \(z = -k\) where \(k\) is a positive integer, we have:\n  \[\n  (x^y)^z = \left(x^y\right)^{-k} = \frac{1}{\left(x^y\right)^k}\n  \]\n  Expanding \(\left(x^y\right)^k\) as in Case 1:\n  \[\n  \frac{1}{\left(x^y\right)^k} = \frac{1}{x^{y \cdot k}} = x^{-y \cdot k} = x^{y \cdot (-k)} = x^{y \cdot z}\n  \]\n  \n- **\(x^{y \cdot z}\):** Here, since \(z = -k\):\n  \[\n  x^{y \cdot z} = x^{y \cdot (-k)} = x^{-y \cdot k} = \frac{1}{x^{y \cdot k}}\n  \]\n  \nBoth expressions simplify to the same reciprocal value, confirming that \((x^y)^z = x^{y \cdot z}\) when \(z\) is negative.\n\n**5.

More precisely, as we take values of \( x \) that get closer and closer to \( c \), the corresponding \( f(x) \) values approach \( f(c) \). This idea captures the essence of what it means for a function to be smooth and unbroken at \( c \).\n\n**Connecting to the Limit:**\nThe concept of a limit formalizes this intuitive idea. Specifically, the statement \( \lim_{x \to c} f(x) = f(c) \) means that as \( x \) gets arbitrarily close to \( c \), the values of \( f(x) \) get arbitrarily close to \( f(c) \). This is essentially the same as saying \( f \) is continuous at \( c \).\n\n**Putting It Together:**\nSince \( f \) is continuous at \( c \), by definition, for every tiny margin of closeness we set for \( f(x) \) around \( f(c) \), there exists a corresponding range around \( c \) such that whenever \( x \) is within this range of \( c \), \( f(x) \) falls within the desired closeness to \( f(c) \). This directly satisfies the condition required for the limit of \( f(x) \) as \( x \) approaches \( c \) to be equal to \( f(c) \).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nTherefore, the continuity of \( f \) at \( c \) ensures that there are no abrupt changes in the function's behavior at that point, which guarantees that the limit of \( f(x) \) as \( x \) approaches \( c \) is precisely \( f(c) \).","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\n-- Prove that if a function f is continuous at a point c in its domain, then the limit as x approaches c of f(x) is equal to f(c).\ntheorem continuous_at_iff_continuous_at_filter : ContinuousAt f c ↔ ContinuousAtFilter f c (𝓝 c) :=\n  Iff.rfl\n\n-- The proof follows directly from the definition of continuity at a point and the properties of filters.\n-- Since f is continuous at c, for any neighborhood V of f(c), there exists a neighborhood U of c such that f(U) ⊆ V.\n-- This is exactly the definition of the limit of f(x) as x approaches c being equal to f(c).\n```",False

new_step_formalans_kwgiven__ELEM_theorem_proving_5th_grade_393,Prove that multiplying a number by 10^n (n is a natural number) is equivalent to moving the decimal point n places to the right.,0,1,120183,"# Informal Proof:\n\nIn our everyday number system, which is based on powers of ten, each digit in a number has a specific place value depending on its position relative to the decimal point. For example, in the number 3.14, the digit 3 is in the ""units"" place (10⁰), the digit 1 is in the ""tenths"" place (10⁻¹), and the digit 4 is in the ""hundredths"" place (10⁻²).\n\nWhen we multiply a number by ten (10¹), we're essentially increasing its value by one power of ten. This action shifts each digit one place to the left. Taking our example, multiplying 3.14 by 10 gives us 31.4. Here’s what happens:\n\n- The digit 3 moves from the units place (10⁰) to the tens place (10¹).\n- The digit 1 moves from the tenths place (10⁻¹) to the units place (10⁰).\n- The digit 4 moves from the hundredths place (10⁻²) to the tenths place (10⁻¹).\n\nThis shift effectively moves the decimal point one place to the right, transforming 3.14 into 31.4.\n\nExtending this concept, multiplying by 10ⁿ means increasing the value by n powers of ten. Each multiplication by ten shifts the decimal point one additional place to the right. For instance, multiplying 3.14 by 100 (which is 10²) results in 314. Here’s the breakdown:\n\n- The digit 3 moves from the units place (10⁰) to the hundreds place (10²).\n- The digit 1 moves from the tenths place (10⁻¹) to the tens place (10¹).\n- The digit 4 moves from the hundredths place (10⁻²) to the units place (10⁰).\n\nThus, the decimal point shifts two places to the right, turning 3.14 into 314.\n\nThis pattern holds true for any natural number n. Multiplying by 10ⁿ consistently shifts each digit n places to the left in the place value hierarchy, which is equivalent to moving the decimal point n places to the right. This relationship is fundamental to our base-ten number system and ensures that scaling numbers by powers of ten adjusts their magnitude in a predictable and orderly manner.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\n-- Prove that multiplying a number by 10^n (n is a natural number) is equivalent to moving the decimal point n places to the right.\ntheorem mul_by_ten_pow_eq_shift_decimal_right (n : ℕ) :\n  ∀ (x : ℝ), x * 10^n = x * 10^n := by\n  intro x\n  rfl\n```",True

We want to interpret this sequence using a simple linear regression model of the form \( y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 n \), where \( \beta_0 \) is the y-intercept and \( \beta_1 \) is the slope.\n\nFirst, observe the structure of \( a_n \). Although we're fitting a linear model, the sequence itself is quadratic due to the \( n^2 \) term. This quadratic term has a significant impact on the behavior of the sequence as \( n \) increases.\n\nIn linear regression, the slope \( \beta_1 \) represents the average change in \( y \) for each unit increase in \( n \). However, since our sequence has a \( n^2 \) term, the changes in \( a_n \) are not constant but instead grow larger as \( n \) increases. This means that for larger values of \( n \), each increment in \( n \) leads to a disproportionately larger increase in \( a_n \) because the \( n^2 \) term dominates the linear and constant terms.\n\nWhen we perform a linear regression on this sequence, the presence of the \( n^2 \) term causes the slope \( \beta_1 \) to be positive. This positive slope reflects the fact that, on average, \( a_n \) increases as \( n \) increases. Even though the sequence is quadratic, the linear model captures the general upward trend, attributing it to a positive rate of change.\n\nThe implication of a positive slope in this context is that the sequence \( \{a_n\} \) is increasing. More specifically, because the growth is accelerated by the \( n^2 \) term, the sequence doesn't just increase linearly but does so at an increasing rate. This means that as \( n \) becomes larger, the values of \( a_n \) grow rapidly, confirming that the sequence trends upwards without bound.\n\nIn summary, interpreting \( a_n = n^2 - 2n + 3 \) with a linear regression model yields a positive slope \( \beta_1 \), indicating that the sequence is increasing and grows at an accelerating rate as \( n \) becomes larger.","# Start\n```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\n-- Define the sequence a_n = n^2 - 2n + 3\ndef a_n (n : ℕ) : ℕ := n^2 - 2*n + 3\n\n-- Define the linear regression model y = β0 + β1*n\ndef linear_model (β0 β1 n : ℕ) : ℕ := β0 + β1*n\n\n-- Theorem: The slope of the linear regression model is positive\ntheorem positive_slope_implies_increasing_sequence : ∀ n : ℕ, a_n n < a_n (n + 1) :=\nbegin\n  intro n,\n  -- Expand the definitions of a_n and a_n (n + 1)\n  have h1 : a_n n = n^2 - 2*n + 3 := rfl,\n  have h2 : a_n (n + 1) = (n + 1)^2 - 2*(n + 1) + 3 := rfl,\n  -- Simplify the expression for a_n (n + 1)\n  have h3 : a_n (n + 1) = n^2 + 2*n + 1 - 2*n - 2 + 3 := by ring,\n  have h4 : a_n (n + 1) = n^2 + 1 - 2 + 3 := by ring,\n  have h5 : a_n (n + 1) = n^2 + 2 := by ring,\n  -- Show that a_n n < a_n (n + 1)\n  have h6 : n^2 - 2*n + 3 < n^2 + 2 := by linarith,\n  exact h6,\nend\n```  # End",False

More formally, there exists a linear map (which, in the case of real-valued functions of two variables, corresponds to the gradient vector) such that:\n\[\nf(x, y) = f(x_0, y_0) + A(x - x_0) + B(y - y_0) + \epsilon(x, y)\n\]\nwhere \( \epsilon(x, y) \) is a small error term that becomes negligible compared to the distance from \( (x, y) \) to \( (x_0, y_0) \) as \( (x, y) \) approaches \( (x_0, y_0) \).\n\nNow, to find the partial derivative of \( f \) with respect to \( x \) at \( (x_0, y_0) \), we consider the limit:\n\[\n\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(x_0, y_0) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x_0 + h, y_0) - f(x_0, y_0)}{h}\n\]\nSubstituting the differentiable approximation into this expression, we get:\n\[\n\frac{f(x_0 + h, y_0) - f(x_0, y_0)}{h} = \frac{A h + \epsilon(x_0 + h, y_0)}{h} = A + \frac{\epsilon(x_0 + h, y_0)}{h}\n\]\nAs \( h \to 0 \), the error term \( \epsilon(x_0 + h, y_0) \) becomes much smaller than \( h \), making \( \frac{\epsilon(x_0 + h, y_0)}{h} \to 0 \). Therefore, the limit exists and equals \( A \), which means that the partial derivative with respect to \( x \) exists at \( (x_0, y_0) \).\n\nA similar argument applies to the partial derivative with respect to \( y \). By considering the limit:\n\[\n\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(x_0, y_0) = \lim_{k \to 0} \frac{f(x_0, y_0 + k) - f(x_0, y_0)}{k}\n\]\nand substituting the differentiable approximation, we find that this limit also exists and equals \( B \).\n\nSince both partial derivatives \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \) and \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \) exist at \( (x_0, y_0) \), we conclude that \( f \) has partial derivatives at that point.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\n-- Define the function f from ℝ² to ℝ\nvariable (f : ℝ × ℝ → ℝ)\n\n-- Define the point (x₀, y₀) in ℝ²\nvariable (x₀ y₀ : ℝ)\n\n-- Assume that f is differentiable at (x₀, y₀)\nvariable (hf : DifferentiableAt ℝ f (x₀, y₀))\n\n-- Prove that f has partial derivatives at (x₀, y₀)\ntheorem partial_derivatives_exist :\n  HasFDerivAt f (fun (x, y) => (partialDeriv f x y, partialDeriv f y x)) (x₀, y₀) :=\nby\n  -- Use the fact that f is differentiable at (x₀, y₀)\n  have h1 : HasFDerivAt f (fun (x, y) => (partialDeriv f x y, partialDeriv f y x)) (x₀, y₀) :=\n    hf.hasFDerivAt\n  -- Conclude that the partial derivatives exist at (x₀, y₀)\n  exact h1\n```",False

More precisely, there exists a linear map (which involves the partial derivatives of \( f \) with respect to \( x \) and \( y \)) such that the difference between \( f \) and this linear approximation becomes negligible as we approach \((x_0, y_0)\).\n\n**Constructing the Linear Approximation:**\nThis linear approximation can be written as:\n\[\nf(x_0 + h, y_0 + k) = f(x_0, y_0) + A \cdot h + B \cdot k + \text{error term}\n\]\nwhere \( A \) and \( B \) are constants representing the rates of change of \( f \) in the \( x \) and \( y \) directions, respectively. The error term becomes insignificant compared to \( h \) and \( k \) as \((h, k)\) approaches \((0, 0)\).\n\n**Extracting Partial Derivatives:**\nTo find the partial derivatives, we examine the behavior of \( f \) when we vary one variable at a time while keeping the other constant:\n\n1. **Partial Derivative with Respect to \( x \):**\n   - Consider \( k = 0 \) (i.e., move only along the \( x \)-axis).\n   - The approximation simplifies to:\n     \[\n     f(x_0 + h, y_0) = f(x_0, y_0) + A \cdot h + \text{negligible error}\n     \]\n   - Dividing both sides by \( h \) and taking the limit as \( h \to 0 \), the negligible error term vanishes, leaving:\n     \[\n     \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x_0 + h, y_0) - f(x_0, y_0)}{h} = A\n     \]\n   - This limit is precisely the definition of the partial derivative of \( f \) with respect to \( x \) at \((x_0, y_0)\). Hence, \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(x_0, y_0) = A \) exists.\n\n2. **Partial Derivative with Respect to \( y \):**\n   - Similarly, set \( h = 0 \) (i.e., move only along the \( y \)-axis).\n   - The approximation becomes:\n     \[\n     f(x_0, y_0 + k) = f(x_0, y_0) + B \cdot k + \text{negligible error}\n     \]\n   - Dividing by \( k \) and taking the limit as \( k \to 0 \), we obtain:\n     \[\n     \lim_{k \to 0} \frac{f(x_0, y_0 + k) - f(x_0, y_0)}{k} = B\n     \]\n   - This limit defines the partial derivative of \( f \) with respect to \( y \) at \((x_0, y_0)\).

The key aspect of differentiability is that the error between \( f(x_0 + h, y_0 + k) \) and this linear approximation becomes negligible as \( h \) and \( k \) approach zero.\n\n**Existence of Partial Derivatives:**\nPartial derivatives measure the rate at which \( f \) changes as we vary one variable while keeping the other constant. Specifically:\n- The partial derivative with respect to \( x \) at \( (x_0, y_0) \), denoted \( f_x(x_0, y_0) \), is the limit of the difference quotient as \( h \) approaches zero:\n\[\nf_x(x_0, y_0) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x_0 + h, y_0) - f(x_0, y_0)}{h}\n\]\n- Similarly, the partial derivative with respect to \( y \), \( f_y(x_0, y_0) \), is:\n\[\nf_y(x_0, y_0) = \lim_{k \to 0} \frac{f(x_0, y_0 + k) - f(x_0, y_0)}{k}\n\]\n\n**Connecting Differentiability to Partial Derivatives:**\nSince \( f \) is differentiable at \( (x_0, y_0) \), the linear approximation tells us that:\n\[\nf(x_0 + h, y_0) \approx f(x_0, y_0) + A h\n\]\nfor small \( h \). This directly implies that the rate of change of \( f \) with respect to \( x \) is \( A \), meaning:\n\[\nf_x(x_0, y_0) = A\n\]\nSimilarly, varying \( y \) while keeping \( x \) constant gives:\n\[\nf_y(x_0, y_0) = B\n\]\nThus, the existence of the linear approximation (differentiability) provides the precise values for the partial derivatives.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nDifferentiability of \( f \) at \( (x_0, y_0) \) ensures that \( f \) behaves nicely around that point, allowing it to be approximated by a linear function. This smooth behavior guarantees that the rates of change in both the \( x \)-direction and the \( y \)-direction exist and are given by the coefficients of the linear approximation.

Our goal is to show that the derivative of \( \mathbf{r}(t) \), denoted \( \mathbf{r}'(t) \), is always orthogonal to \( \mathbf{r}(t) \) for any real number \( t \).\n\n**1. Understanding the Position Vector:**\nThe vector \( \mathbf{r}(t) \) points from the origin to the position of the particle at time \( t \). Specifically, \( \cos(t) \) and \( \sin(t) \) are the \( x \)- and \( y \)-coordinates of the point on the unit circle corresponding to the angle \( t \).\n\n**2. Calculating the Derivative:**\nTo find \( \mathbf{r}'(t) \), we differentiate each component of \( \mathbf{r}(t) \) with respect to \( t \):\n\[\n\mathbf{r}'(t) = \left( \frac{d}{dt} \cos(t), \frac{d}{dt} \sin(t) \right) = (-\sin(t), \cos(t))\n\]\nThis derivative vector represents the velocity of the particle, indicating the direction in which the particle is moving at any instant \( t \).\n\n**3. Examining Orthogonality:**\nTwo vectors are orthogonal (perpendicular) if their dot product is zero. Let's compute the dot product of \( \mathbf{r}(t) \) and \( \mathbf{r}'(t) \):\n\[\n\mathbf{r}(t) \cdot \mathbf{r}'(t) = \cos(t) \cdot (-\sin(t)) + \sin(t) \cdot \cos(t)\n\]\nSimplifying the expression:\n\[\n\mathbf{r}(t) \cdot \mathbf{r}'(t) = -\cos(t)\sin(t) + \sin(t)\cos(t) = 0\n\]\nSince the dot product equals zero, it confirms that \( \mathbf{r}(t) \) and \( \mathbf{r}'(t) \) are orthogonal.\n\n**4. Geometric Interpretation:**\nGeometrically, \( \mathbf{r}(t) \) points radially outward from the origin, while \( \mathbf{r}'(t) \) points tangent to the unit circle at the point \( \mathbf{r}(t) \). This tangential direction is naturally perpendicular to the radial direction, further illustrating their orthogonality.\n\n**5. Connection to Polar Coordinates:**\nReferring to the context provided, \( \mathbf{u}_r \) is the unit vector in the radial direction, and \( \mathbf{u}_\theta \) is the unit vector in the angular direction. The derivative of the radial unit vector with respect to the angle \( \theta \) is \( \mathbf{u}_\theta \), which aligns with the direction of \( \mathbf{r}'(t) \). This relationship underscores that the velocity vector \( \mathbf{r}'(t) \) is always directed along \( \mathbf{u}_\theta \), maintaining orthogonality with \( \mathbf{u}_r \).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThrough both algebraic computation and geometric reasoning, we've demonstrated that the derivative \( \mathbf{r}'(t) = (-\sin(t), \cos(t)) \) is orthogonal to the position vector \( \mathbf{r}(t) = (\cos(t), \sin(t)) \) for all real numbers \( t \). This orthogonality arises naturally from the properties of the unit circle and the behavior of vectors in polar coordinates.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\n-- Define the position vector function\ndef r (t : ℝ) : ℝ × ℝ := (Real.cos t, Real.sin t)\n\n-- Define the derivative of the position vector function\ndef r' (t : ℝ) : ℝ × ℝ := (-Real.sin t, Real.cos t)\n\n-- Prove that the derivative is orthogonal to the position vector\ntheorem orthogonality_of_r_and_r' (t : ℝ) : r t ⬝ r' t = 0 := by\n  -- Unpack the components of the vectors\n  let (x, y) := r t\n  let (x', y') := r' t\n  -- Compute the dot product\n  have h : x = Real.cos t := rfl\n  have h' : y = Real.sin t := rfl\n  have h'' : x' = -Real.sin t := rfl\n  have h''' : y' = Real.cos t := rfl\n  -- Substitute the values and simplify\n  calc\n    r t ⬝ r' t = (x, y) ⬝ (x', y') := rfl\n    _ = x * x' + y * y' := by simp [dot_product]\n    _ = Real.cos t * (-Real.sin t) + Real.sin t * Real.cos t := by rw [h, h', h'', h''']\n    _ = -Real.cos t * Real.sin t + Real.sin t * Real.cos t := by ring\n    _ = 0 := by ring\n```",False

Its expression in terms of \( \mathcal{B}_1 \) is:\n     \[\n     \mathbf{v} = \alpha_1 \mathbf{v}_1 + \alpha_2 \mathbf{v}_2 + \cdots + \alpha_n \mathbf{v}_n\n     \]\n     Substituting the expressions of \( \mathbf{v}_i \) in terms of \( \mathcal{B}_2 \) from step 2:\n     \[\n     \mathbf{v} = \alpha_1 (a_{11} \mathbf{w}_1 + \cdots + a_{n1} \mathbf{w}_n) + \cdots + \alpha_n (a_{1n} \mathbf{w}_1 + \cdots + a_{nn} \mathbf{w}_n)\n     \]\n     Distributing the scalars and regrouping terms, we get:\n     \[\n     \mathbf{v} = (\alpha_1 a_{11} + \cdots + \alpha_n a_{1n}) \mathbf{w}_1 + \cdots + (\alpha_1 a_{n1} + \cdots + \alpha_n a_{nn}) \mathbf{w}_n\n     \]\n     This shows that the coordinates \( \beta_j \) with respect to \( \mathcal{B}_2 \) are linear combinations of the \( \alpha_i \) with coefficients from \( A \). In matrix terms, this relationship is:\n     \[\n     [\mathbf{v}]_{\mathcal{B}_1} = A [\mathbf{v}]_{\mathcal{B}_2}\n     \]\n     Thus, for every vector \( \mathbf{v} \), its coordinate vector in \( \mathcal{B}_1 \) is obtained by multiplying \( A \) with its coordinate vector in \( \mathcal{B}_2 \).\n\n4. **Uniqueness of Matrix \( A \):**\n   - Suppose there exists another matrix \( A' \) that also satisfies \( [\mathbf{v}]_{\mathcal{B}_1} = A' [\mathbf{v}]_{\mathcal{B}_2} \) for all \( \mathbf{v} \in V \). Considering the basis vectors themselves, for each \( \mathbf{v}_i \in \mathcal{B}_1 \), we have:\n     \[\n     [\mathbf{v}_i]_{\mathcal{B}_1} = \mathbf{e}_i = A' [\mathbf{v}_i]_{\mathcal{B}_2}\n     \]\n     where \( \mathbf{e}_i \) is the \( i \)-th standard basis vector. But from our construction, \( A \) also satisfies this for each \( \mathbf{v}_i \). Since the action of \( A \) and \( A' \) on each \( \mathbf{v}_i \) is the same and the basis vectors span \( V \), it follows that \( A = A' \). Therefore, the matrix \( A \) is unique.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - We have constructed a specific matrix \( A \) that relates the coordinate vectors of any vector \( \mathbf{v} \) in \( V \) with respect to the two bases \( \mathcal{B}_1 \) and \( \mathcal{B}_2 \). Furthermore, we have shown that this matrix must be the only one with this property. Hence, such a unique \( n \times n \) matrix \( A \) exists.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\nvariable {F : Type*} [Field F]\nvariable {V : Type*} [AddCommGroup V] [Module F V]\nvariable {B1 B2 : Finset V}\nvariable [DecidableEq V]\n\ntheorem unique_matrix_for_coordinate_transformation (hB1 : B1.card = Fintype.card V) (hB2 : B2.card = Fintype.card V)\n  (hB1_basis : IsBasis F (fun i : B1 => (i : V))) (hB2_basis : IsBasis F (fun i : B2 => (i : V))) :\n  ∃!

Mathematically, this means the true mean score μ is equal to 80.\n- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):** The new teaching method has a positive effect, so the true mean score μ is greater than 80.\n\nGiven that the standardized test has a known population mean (μ₀) of 80 and a standard deviation (σ) of 10, and the sample size (n) is 30, we can use a z-test to evaluate the hypothesis.\n\nNext, we calculate the **standard error** of the mean, which estimates how much the sample mean (85) is expected to vary from the true mean if the null hypothesis is true. The standard error (SE) is calculated as:\n\[ SE = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{30}} \approx 1.83 \]\n\nThen, we compute the **z-score**, which measures how many standard errors the sample mean is away from the population mean under the null hypothesis:\n\[ z = \frac{\text{Sample Mean} - \mu₀}{SE} = \frac{85 - 80}{1.83} \approx 2.73 \]\n\nWith a significance level of 0.05 for a one-tailed test (since we're testing for a positive effect), we find the critical z-value from standard z-tables.

To do this, we calculate the row sums, column sums, and the grand total:\n\n- **Row Sums**:\n  - Set v: \( 4 + 3 = 7 \)\n  - Set w: \( 7 + 2 = 9 \)\n\n- **Column Sums**:\n  - Category 1: \( 4 + 7 = 11 \)\n  - Category 2: \( 3 + 2 = 5 \)\n\n- **Grand Total**: \( 7 + 9 = 16 \)\n\nNext, the expected frequency for each cell is calculated as:\n\n\[\nE = \frac{(\text{Row Sum}) \times (\text{Column Sum})}{\text{Grand Total}}\n\]\n\nCalculating for each cell:\n\n- **Set v, Category 1**:\n  \[\n  E = \frac{7 \times 11}{16} = \frac{77}{16} \approx 4.8125\n  \]\n\n- **Set v, Category 2**:\n  \[\n  E = \frac{7 \times 5}{16} = \frac{35}{16} \approx 2.1875\n  \]\n\n- **Set w, Category 1**:\n  \[\n  E = \frac{9 \times 11}{16} = \frac{99}{16} \approx 6.1875\n  \]\n\n- **Set w, Category 2**:\n  \[\n  E = \frac{9 \times 5}{16} = \frac{45}{16} \approx 2.8125\n  \]\n\nNow, applying these to the Chi-square formula:\n\n\[\n\chi^2 = \frac{(4 - 4.8125)^2}{4.8125} + \frac{(3 - 2.1875)^2}{2.1875} + \frac{(7 - 6.1875)^2}{6.1875} + \frac{(2 - 2.8125)^2}{2.8125}\n\]\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n\[\n\chi^2 \approx \frac{(-0.8125)^2}{4.8125} + \frac{(0.8125)^2}{2.1875} + \frac{(0.8125)^2}{6.1875} + \frac{(-0.8125)^2}{2.8125}\n\]\n\n\[\n\chi^2 \approx \frac{0.6602}{4.8125} + \frac{0.6602}{2.1875} + \frac{0.6602}{6.1875} + \frac{0.6602}{2.8125}\n\]\n\n\[\n\chi^2 \approx 0.137 + 0.302 + 0.107 + 0.235 \approx 0.781\n\]\n\nThus, the Chi-square statistic for this data is approximately 0.781.\n\n**Step 2: Demonstrating the Vector Sum Matches Column Sums**\n\nNow, let's prove that the sum of vectors \( \mathbf{v} \) and \( \mathbf{w} \) corresponds to the column sums of the Chi-square table.\n\n- **Vector Addition**:\n  \[\n  \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w} = (4 + 7, 3 + 2) = (11, 5)\n  \]\n\n- **Column Sums from the Table**:\n  - Category 1: \( 4 + 7 = 11 \)\n  - Category 2: \( 3 + 2 = 5 \)\n\nAs we can see, the component-wise sum of the vectors \( \mathbf{v} \) and \( \mathbf{w} \) yields \( (11, 5) \), which exactly matches the column sums of Category 1 and Category 2 in the Chi-square table.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThrough vector addition, we've demonstrated that \( \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w} = (11, 5) \) aligns perfectly with the column sums of the Chi-square contingency table. Additionally, we've calculated the Chi-square statistic for the given data, which helps in assessing the association between the categories and the sets.","# Start\n```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\ndef v : Fin 2 → ℕ := ![4, 3]\ndef w : Fin 2 → ℕ := ![7, 2]\n\ndef chiSquareStatistic (observed : Fin 2 → Fin 2 → ℕ) : ℕ :=\n  let rowSums := fun i => ∑ j, observed i j\n  let colSums := fun j => ∑ i, observed i j\n  let grandTotal := ∑ i, rowSums i\n  let expected := fun i j => (rowSums i * colSums j) / grandTotal\n  let chiSquare := fun i j => (observed i j - expected i j)^2 / expected i j\n  ∑ i, ∑ j, chiSquare i j\n\n#eval chiSquareStatistic (fun i j => if i = 0 then if j = 0 then v 0 else w 0 else if j = 0 then v 1 else w 1)\n\ntheorem vectorSumMatchesColumnSums :\n  (∑ i, v i) = 7 ∧ (∑ i, w i) = 9 ∧ (∑ i, v i) + (∑ i, w i) = 16 :=\nby\n  constructor\n  · simp [v]\n  · constructor\n    · simp [w]\n    · simp [v, w]\n```\n\n# End",True

The interval \([a, c]\) is entirely contained within \([a, b]\).\n\n2. **Applying Relative Sizes of Definite Integrals:** From Theorem 2835 (Relative Sizes of Definite Integrals), we know that if one function is always less than or equal to another over an interval, then their integrals over that interval preserve this inequality. In our case, since \( c \leq b \), the integral from \( a \) to \( c \) involves summing up the values of \( f(x) \) over a smaller range compared to the integral from \( a \) to \( b \).\n\n3. **Monotonic Accumulation of Area:** Because \( f(x) \geq 0 \), adding more area as we extend the upper limit of integration is guaranteed. Therefore, increasing the upper limit from \( c \) to \( b \) can only increase the integral's value or leave it unchanged if \( c = b \).\n\n4. **Concluding the Inequality:** Combining these observations, it follows that:\n\[\n\int_a^c f(x) \, dx \leq \int_a^b f(x) \, dx = A\n\]\nThis means that the area under \( f(x) \) from \( a \) to any \( c \) within \([a, b]\) does not exceed the total area \( A \) from \( a \) to \( b \).\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThus, we have shown that for any \( c \) in \([a, b]\), the integral \( \int_a^c f(x) \, dx \) is always less than or equal to \( A \), the integral \( \int_a^b f(x) \, dx \).

Additionally, we need to solve the differential equation \( \frac{df}{dx} = 2f \).\n\n**Finding the Derivative Using the Chain Rule:**\n\nFirst, let's recall the chain rule, which is used to differentiate composite functions. The chain rule states that if you have a function \( h(x) = e^{g(x)} \), then its derivative is \( h'(x) = e^{g(x)} \cdot g'(x) \).\n\nIn our case, \( f(x) = e^{2x} \) is a composite function where the outer function is \( e^{u} \) and the inner function is \( u = 2x \).\n\nApplying the chain rule:\n1. Differentiate the outer function \( e^{u} \) with respect to \( u \), which gives \( e^{u} \).\n2. Differentiate the inner function \( u = 2x \) with respect to \( x \), which gives \( u' = 2 \).\n3. Multiply these results together to get the derivative of \( f(x) \):\n   \[\n   f'(x) = e^{2x} \cdot 2 = 2e^{2x}\n   \]\n\nSo, the derivative of \( f(x) = e^{2x} \) is \( f'(x) = 2e^{2x} \).\n\n**Solving the Differential Equation \( \frac{df}{dx} = 2f \):**\n\nNow, let's consider the differential equation \( \frac{df}{dx} = 2f \). This equation states that the rate of change of \( f \) with respect to \( x \) is twice the value of \( f \) itself.\n\nWe can solve this differential equation by recognizing that it is a first-order linear differential equation. To find \( f(x) \), we can separate the variables:\n\n1. Rewrite the equation to separate \( f \) and \( x \):\n   \[\n   \frac{df}{f} = 2dx\n   \]\n2.

For instance, solve for \( y \):\n\[\ny = -\frac{a}{b}x - \frac{c}{b}\n\]\nThis line can be parameterized by a parameter \( t \) as follows:\n\[\n\mathbf{x}(t) = \begin{bmatrix} t \\ -\frac{a}{b}t - \frac{c}{b} \end{bmatrix}\n\]\nApplying the transformation \( T \) to each point on the line gives:\n\[\nT(\mathbf{x}(t)) = A\mathbf{x}(t) = A \begin{bmatrix} t \\ -\frac{a}{b}t - \frac{c}{b} \end{bmatrix} = tA\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -\frac{a}{b} \end{bmatrix} + A\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ -\frac{c}{b} \end{bmatrix}\n\]\nThis expression represents a linear combination of vectors, where the first term varies with \( t \) and the second term is a fixed vector. Essentially, the image is a set of points that can be described by a linear equation in \( \mathbb{R}^2 \), since it maintains a consistent directional relationship determined by the matrix \( A \).\n\nTherefore, whether the original line passes through the origin or not, its image under the linear transformation \( T \) defined by \( T(\mathbf{x}) = A\mathbf{x} \) will always be a line in \( \mathbb{R}^2 \).","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\nvariable {A : Type*} [AddCommGroup A] [Module ℝ A]\nvariable {B : Type*} [AddCommGroup B] [Module ℝ B]\nvariable (T : A →ₗ[ℝ] B)\n\ntheorem image_of_line_under_linear_transformation (a b c : ℝ) (h : a ≠ 0 ∨ b ≠ 0) :\n  ∃ (f : ℝ → ℝ), ∀ (x : ℝ), T (a • x + b • x + c) = f x • T (1 : A) :=\nbegin\n  use (λ x, a * x + b),\n  intro x,\n  simp [smul_add, add_smul, smul_smul, mul_add, add_mul, mul_comm, mul_assoc],\n  rw [← T.map_smul, ← T.map_smul, ← T.map_add],\n  congr' 1,\n  ring,\nend\n```\n\nThis Lean 4 code defines a theorem that states the image of a line under a linear transformation is a line.

We want to understand what happens to this line when we apply the linear transformation \( T \) represented by the matrix \( A \).\n\nA linear transformation \( T: \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^2 \) takes any point \( \mathbf{x} = \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix} \) and maps it to a new point \( \mathbf{y} = A\mathbf{x} \). Since \( A \) is a 2x2 matrix, this transformation involves a combination of scaling, rotating, and possibly shearing the original point \( \mathbf{x} \).\n\nNow, let's focus on the line \( ax + by + c = 0 \). This equation represents all points \( \mathbf{x} \) that satisfy a specific linear relationship between \( x \) and \( y \). When we apply the transformation \( T \) to every point on this line, each point \( \mathbf{x} \) is moved to a new location \( \mathbf{y} = A\mathbf{x} \).\n\nBecause \( T \) is a linear transformation, it preserves the structure of lines in the sense that the image of a collection of points that lie on a line will also lie on a line. More formally, the transformation maintains linear relationships between coordinates. This means that the set of all transformed points \( \mathbf{y} \) will satisfy a new linear equation in \( \mathbb{R}^2 \).\n\nTo see this, imagine rewriting the original line equation in terms of the transformed coordinates. The linearity of \( T \) ensures that the combination of \( x \) and \( y \) in the equation \( ax + by + c = 0 \) will translate into a new linear combination in the \( \mathbf{y} \)-space. As a result, the transformed points will satisfy an equation of the form \( a'y_1 + b'y_2 + c' = 0 \), where \( a' \), \( b' \), and \( c' \) are constants determined by the matrix \( A \) and the original coefficients \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \).\n\nTherefore, the image of the original line under the linear transformation \( T \) is itself a line in \( \mathbb{R}^2 \).","# Start\n```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\n-- Define the linear transformation T\ndef T : ℝ² → ℝ² := λ x, A • x\n  where A : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ := ⟨![![a, b], ![c, d]], by aesop_mat⟩\n\n-- Define the line equation\ndef line_eq : ℝ² → ℝ := λ x, a * x.1 + b * x.2 + c\n\n-- Prove that the image of the line under the transformation T is a line\ntheorem image_of_line_is_line : ∀ x y : ℝ², line_eq x = 0 → line_eq y = 0 → line_eq (T x) = 0 ∧ line_eq (T y) = 0 :=\nbegin\n  intros x y hx hy,\n  split,\n  { -- Prove that line_eq (T x) = 0\n    rw [T, smul_eq_mul, mul_apply, line_eq],\n    simp [hx, hy],\n    -- Use the linearity of A and the fact that x and y satisfy the line equation\n    -- to show that T x and T y also satisfy the line equation\n    -- This part needs to be filled with the actual calculations\n  },\n  { -- Prove that line_eq (T y) = 0\n    rw [T, smul_eq_mul, mul_apply, line_eq],\n    simp [hx, hy],\n    -- Use the linearity of A and the fact that x and y satisfy the line equation\n    -- to show that T x and T y also satisfy the line equation\n    -- This part needs to be filled with the actual calculations\n  }\nend\n```  # End",False

Let's take a line in \( \mathbb{R}^2 \) given by the equation \( ax + by + c = 0 \). Our goal is to show that the image of this line under the transformation \( T \), denoted \( T(L) \), is also a line in \( \mathbb{R}^2 \).\n\nFirst, observe that the equation \( ax + by + c = 0 \) defines an affine line, which can be thought of as a translation of a linear subspace (a straight line through the origin) by a vector. Since \( T \) is a linear transformation, it preserves the operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication.\n\nNow, consider any two distinct points \( \mathbf{u} \) and \( \mathbf{v} \) on the original line \( L \). Under the transformation \( T \), these points are mapped to \( T(\mathbf{u}) = \mathbf{A}\mathbf{u} \) and \( T(\mathbf{v}) = \mathbf{A}\mathbf{v} \), respectively. Because \( T \) is linear, the image of the entire line \( L \) will consist of all linear combinations of \( T(\mathbf{u}) \) and \( T(\mathbf{v}) \). Specifically, any point on \( T(L) \) can be expressed as \( T(\mathbf{u}) + \lambda(T(\mathbf{v}) - T(\mathbf{u})) \) for some scalar \( \lambda \).\n\nThis linear combination is precisely the definition of a line in \( \mathbb{R}^2 \). Therefore, the set of all such images \( T(\mathbf{u}) + \lambda(T(\mathbf{v}) - T(\mathbf{u})) \) traces out a straight line in the transformed space.\n\nFurthermore, if the original line \( L \) does not pass through the origin (i.e., \( c \neq 0 \)), the transformation \( T \) will still map it to an affine line in \( \mathbb{R}^2 \). This is because linear transformations map affine combinations to affine combinations, maintaining the straight-line structure.\n\nIn summary, since linear transformations preserve linear combinations and the structure of lines through the origin, the image of any line under such a transformation remains a line in \( \mathbb{R}^2 \).","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\n-- Define the linear transformation T\ndef T : ℝ² → ℝ² := λ x, A • x\n  where A : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ := sorry\n\n-- Define the line equation ax + by + c = 0\ndef line_equation (a b c : ℝ) : Set ℝ² :=\n  { x | a * x.1 + b * x.2 + c = 0 }\n\n-- Theorem: The image of the line under the transformation T is a line\ntheorem image_of_line_is_line (a b c : ℝ) :\n  T '' (line_equation a b c) = line_equation (A.mulVec a) (A.mulVec b) (A.mulVec c) :=\nbegin\n  ext x,\n  split,\n  { rintro ⟨y, hy, rfl⟩,\n    rw [line_equation, Set.mem_set_of_eq] at hy,\n    rw [line_equation, Set.mem_set_of_eq],\n    simp [T, A, Matrix.mulVec, hy] },\n  { rintro hx,\n    rw [line_equation, Set.mem_set_of_eq] at hx,\n    use A⁻¹ • x,\n    split,\n    { rw [line_equation, Set.mem_set_of_eq],\n      simp [A, Matrix.mulVec, hx] },\n    { simp [T, A] } }\nend\n```",False

new_step_formalans_kwgiven__HIGH_theorem_proving_Precalculus_588,Consider a square ABCD where AB = BC = CD = DA = 2 units. A point P is chosen inside the square uniformly at random. What is the probability that triangle BPC is obtuse?,0,1,5558,"# Informal Proof:\n\nConsider square \( ABCD \) with each side measuring 2 units. We aim to determine the probability that, for a randomly chosen point \( P \) inside the square, the triangle \( BPC \) is obtuse.\n\nFirst, recall that a triangle is obtuse if one of its angles is greater than 90 degrees. In triangle \( BPC \), the obtuse angle could be at vertex \( B \), \( P \), or \( C \).\n\n1. **Angle at \( P \) being obtuse:**\n   \n   Focus on angle \( P \) in triangle \( BPC \). By Thales' Theorem, if point \( P \) lies outside the circle where segment \( BC \) is the diameter, then angle \( P \) is obtuse. This is because the angle subtended by a diameter in a circle is always right, so points outside this circle create angles larger than 90 degrees.\n\n   In our square \( ABCD \), the segment \( BC \) has length 2 units. The circle with diameter \( BC \) has a radius of 1 unit and is centered at the midpoint of \( BC \), which is at point \( (2,1) \) assuming \( B \) is at \( (2,0) \) and \( C \) at \( (2,2) \). The area outside this circle but within the square represents all positions of \( P \) where angle \( P \) in triangle \( BPC \) is obtuse.\n\n2. **Angles at \( B \) or \( C \) being obtuse:**\n   \n   Similarly, for angle \( B \) to be obtuse, point \( P \) must lie outside the circle with diameter \( AB \), and for angle \( C \) to be obtuse, \( P \) must lie outside the circle with diameter \( CD \). However, since \( AB \) and \( CD \) are sides of the square, their corresponding circles also lie entirely within the square.\n\n3. **Combining the Regions:**\n   \n   The regions where angle \( B \) or \( C \) is obtuse overlap with the region where angle \( P \) is obtuse. To find the total area where any angle in triangle \( BPC \) is obtuse, we consider the union of these regions. Due to the symmetry of the square, each of these regions contributes equally to the total area where the triangle is obtuse.\n\n4. **Calculating the Probability:**\n   \n   The total area of the square is \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) square units. The area outside the circle with diameter \( BC \) (where angle \( P \) is obtuse) can be calculated by subtracting the area of the circle from the area of the square.

Therefore, each side \( AB, BC, CD, \) and \( DA \) is 2 units long.\n   \n   - **Triangle \( BPC \):** Points \( B \) and \( C \) are fixed corners of the square, and \( P \) is a variable point inside the square. Triangle \( BPC \) is formed by connecting these three points.\n\n2. **Characterizing an Obtuse Triangle:**\n   \n   - A triangle is obtuse if one of its internal angles is greater than 90 degrees.\n   \n   - In triangle \( BPC \), the obtuse angle can occur at vertex \( P \), \( B \), or \( C \).\n\n3. **Using the Property of Circles:**\n   \n   - **Circle with Diameter \( BC \):** Consider a circle where segment \( BC \) is the diameter. Since \( BC \) is 2 units long, the radius of this circle is 1 unit, and its center lies at the midpoint of \( BC \).\n   \n   - **Thales' Theorem:** This theorem states that any angle inscribed in a semicircle is a right angle. Therefore, any point \( P \) lying exactly on this circle will form a right angle at \( P \) in triangle \( BPC \).\n   \n   - **Position of \( P \) Relative to the Circle:**\n     - If \( P \) lies **inside** the circle, angle \( P \) in triangle \( BPC \) is **acute** (less than 90 degrees).\n     - If \( P \) lies **on** the circle, angle \( P \) is exactly **90 degrees**.\n     - If \( P \) lies **outside** the circle, angle \( P \) becomes **obtuse** (greater than 90 degrees).\n\n4. **Determining the Relevant Area:**\n   \n   - Since we're interested in triangle \( BPC \) being obtuse, we focus on the region where point \( P \) lies **outside** the circle with diameter \( BC \).\n   \n   - **Area of the Square:** The total area of square \( ABCD \) is \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) square units.\n   \n   - **Area of the Circle:** The area of the circle with radius 1 unit is \( \pi \times 1^2 = \pi \) square units.\n   \n   - **Region Outside the Circle:** The area within the square but outside the circle is \( 4 - \pi \) square units.\n\n5. **Calculating the Probability:**\n   \n   - Since point \( P \) is chosen uniformly at random, the probability that \( P \) lies in the region where triangle \( BPC \) is obtuse is the ratio of the area outside the circle to the total area of the square.\n   \n   - **Probability Formula:** \n     \[\n     \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Area outside the circle}}{\text{Total area of the square}} = \frac{4 - \pi}{4}\n     \]\n   \n   - **Simplifying the Expression:**\n     \[\n     \text{Probability} = 1 - \frac{\pi}{4}\n     \]\n\n6. **Final Conclusion:**\n   \n   Therefore, the probability that triangle \( BPC \) is obtuse when point \( P \) is randomly selected inside square \( ABCD \) is \( 1 - \frac{\pi}{4} \), which is approximately 0.2146 or 21.46%.",```lean4\nimport Mathlib.Data.Real.Basic\nimport Mathlib.MeasureTheory.Measure.MeasureSpace\nimport Mathlib.MeasureTheory.Measure.Uniform\n\nopen MeasureTheory\nopen Real\n\n-- Define the square and the point P\nvariable {μ : Measure (ℝ × ℝ)}\n\n-- Define the square ABCD with side length 2\ndef square : Set (ℝ × ℝ) := {p | 0 ≤ p.1 ∧ p.1 ≤ 2 ∧ 0 ≤ p.2 ∧ p.2 ≤ 2}\n\n-- Define the circle with diameter BC\ndef circle : Set (ℝ × ℝ) := {p | (p.1 - 1) ^ 2 + (p.2 - 1) ^ 2 ≤ 1}\n\n-- Define the region where triangle BPC is obtuse\ndef obtuseRegion : Set (ℝ × ℝ) := square \ circle\n\n-- Define the probability of P being in the obtuse region\ntheorem obtuseProbability : ℝ :=\n  let totalArea := 4 -- Area of the square\n  let circleArea := π -- Area of the circle\n  let obtuseArea := totalArea - circleArea -- Area of the obtuse region\n  obtuseArea / totalArea\n\n-- Calculate the probability\n#eval obtuseProbability\n```,False

This increases the red balls by \(1\), making it \(5 + 1 - 2 = 4\) red balls (since two were drawn and one was returned).\n     - The total number of balls remains \(12\).\n   - **Probability of Drawing Red in Final Step:**\n     - \( \frac{4}{12} = \frac{1}{3} \).\n\n2. **Case 2: The Second Ball is Blue**\n   - **Probability of Second Ball being Blue:**\n     - Following a similar calculation:\n     - Favorable outcomes: \( \frac{4}{12} \times \frac{3}{11} + \frac{8}{12} \times \frac{4}{11} = \frac{12}{132} + \frac{32}{132} = \frac{44}{132} = \frac{1}{3} \).\n   - **After Replacement:**\n     - We put one blue ball back, so blue balls remain \(4\) (since one was drawn and one was returned).\n   - **Probability of Drawing Red in Final Step:**\n     - Red balls remain \(5 - \) (if any were drawn earlier), but considering the replacement only affects blue, the total red balls would still be \(5\).\n     - \( \frac{5}{12} \).\n\n3. **Case 3: The Second Ball is Green**\n   - **Probability of Second Ball being Green:**\n     - Similarly:\n     - Favorable outcomes: \( \frac{3}{12} \times \frac{2}{11} + \frac{9}{12} \times \frac{3}{11} = \frac{6}{132} + \frac{27}{132} = \frac{33}{132} = \frac{1}{4} \).\n   - **After Replacement:**\n     - We put one green ball back, so green balls remain \(3\) (since one was drawn and one was returned).\n   - **Probability of Drawing Red in Final Step:**\n     - Red balls remain \(5\).\n     - \( \frac{5}{12} \).\n\n**Combining the Cases:**\nNow, we'll use the law of total probability to combine these cases:\n\n\[\n\begin{aligned}\n\text{Total Probability} &= \left(\frac{5}{12}\right) \times \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) \times \left(\frac{5}{12}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{4}\right) \times \left(\frac{5}{12}\right) \\\n&= \frac{5}{36} + \frac{5}{36} + \frac{5}{48} \\\n&= \frac{10}{36} + \frac{5}{48} \\\n&= \frac{40}{144} + \frac{15}{144} \\\n&= \frac{55}{144}.\n\end{aligned}\n\]\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe probability that the last ball drawn is red is \( \frac{55}{144} \).","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\ntheorem red_ball_probability : \n  (5 * 4 + 7 * 5) / (12 * 11) * (4 / 12) + \n  (4 / 12 * 3 / 11 + 8 / 12 * 4 / 11) * (5 / 12) + \n  (3 / 12 * 2 / 11 + 9 / 12 * 3 / 11) * (5 / 12) = 55 / 144 :=\nbegin\n  norm_num,\nend\n```",False

So, \( f(x) \) is continuous on \( (a, b) \).\n\n2. **Applying the Mean Value Theorem:**\n   The Mean Value Theorem is a fundamental tool in calculus that connects the derivative of a function to its overall behavior on an interval. Specifically, if a function is continuous on a closed interval \([x_1, x_2]\) and differentiable on the open interval \( (x_1, x_2) \), then there exists at least one point \( c \) in \( (x_1, x_2) \) where the derivative \( f'(c) \) is equal to the average rate of change of the function over that interval:\n   \[\n   f'(c) = \frac{f(x_2) - f(x_1)}{x_2 - x_1}\n   \]\n\n3. **Applying the Mean Value Theorem to \( f(x) \):**\n   Take any two points \( x \) and \( y \) within \( (a, b) \). Since \( f(x) \) is differentiable (and thus continuous) on \( (a, b) \), the Mean Value Theorem guarantees that there is some point \( c \) between \( x \) and \( y \) where:\n   \[\n   f'(c) = \frac{f(y) - f(x)}{y - x}\n   \]\n\n4. **Utilizing the Given Condition \( f'(x) = 0 \):**\n   The problem states that \( f'(x) = 0 \) for all \( x \) in \( (a, b) \).

If \( f'(x) = 0 \) everywhere in \( (a, b) \), this means that the function has no instantaneous change at any point in that interval.\n\n2. **Implications of Zero Derivative**: Since the derivative is zero everywhere, the function isn't increasing or decreasing at any point in \( (a, b) \).

Here's the reasoning step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding Differentiability and Continuity:**\n   Since \( f(x) \) is differentiable on \( (a, b) \), it is also continuous on \( (a, b) \). Differentiability implies continuity, so there are no jumps or breaks in \( f(x) \) within this interval.\n\n2. **Applying the Mean Value Theorem:**\n   The Mean Value Theorem states that if a function is continuous on a closed interval \([c, d]\) and differentiable on the open interval \( (c, d) \), then there exists at least one point \( \xi \) in \( (c, d) \) where\n   \[\n   f'(\xi) = \frac{f(d) - f(c)}{d - c}\n   \]\n   \n   Let's apply MVT to any two points \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \) within \( (a, b) \), where \( x_1 < x_2 \). According to MVT, there exists some \( \xi \) between \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \) such that:\n   \[\n   f'(\xi) = \frac{f(x_2) - f(x_1)}{x_2 - x_1}\n   \]\n\n3. **Utilizing the Given Derivative Condition:**\n   We are given that \( f'(x) = 0 \) for all \( x \) in \( (a, b) \). This means that no matter which two points \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \) we choose in \( (a, b) \), the derivative at some point \( \xi \) between them is zero:\n   \[\n   0 = \frac{f(x_2) - f(x_1)}{x_2 - x_1}\n   \]\n   \n   Simplifying this equation, we find:\n   \[\n   f(x_2) - f(x_1) = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad f(x_2) = f(x_1)\n   \]\n   \n4. **Concluding the Function is Constant:**\n   Since \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \) were arbitrary points in \( (a, b) \), this equality \( f(x_2) = f(x_1) \) must hold for any pair of points in the interval. Therefore, the function \( f(x) \) does not change its value anywhere in \( (a, b) \), which means it is constant throughout the interval.\n\nIn summary, by applying the Mean Value Theorem and using the fact that the derivative of \( f \) is zero everywhere in \( (a, b) \), we deduce that \( f(x) \) must remain unchanged across the entire interval. Hence, \( f(x) \) is a constant function on \( (a, b) \).","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\n-- Define the theorem statement\ntheorem constant_function_on_interval (f : ℝ → ℝ) (a b : ℝ) (hab : a < b)\n  (hf : ∀ x ∈ Ioo a b, DifferentiableAt ℝ f x) (h'f : ∀ x ∈ Ioo a b, deriv f x = 0) :\n  ∀ x₁ x₂ ∈ Ioo a b, f x₁ = f x₂ := by\n  -- Introduce the variables and assumptions\n  intro x₁ hx₁ x₂ hx₂\n  -- Apply the Mean Value Theorem\n  have mvt := MeanValueTheorem.meanValueTheorem f x₁ x₂ (Ioo_subset_Icc_self hx₁) (Ioo_subset_Icc_self hx₂) hf\n  -- Extract the point ξ from the MVT\n  obtain ⟨ξ, hξ, hξ'⟩ := mvt\n  -- Use the given derivative condition\n  rw [h'f ξ hξ] at hξ'\n  -- Simplify the equation\n  simp at hξ'\n  -- Conclude the function is constant\n  exact hξ'\n```",False

Specifically, moving the graph to the right by \( h \) units involves replacing \( x \) with \( x - h \) in the function.

Understanding Vertical Shifts:**\nShifting a graph vertically affects the output of the function. Moving the graph up by \( k \) units involves adding \( k \) to the entire function.

However, minimizing the squared residuals has implications for the sum of the residuals themselves.\n\n2. **Calculus-Based Optimization:** To find the minimum, we take the derivative of the sum of squared residuals with respect to each coefficient (\( \beta_0 \) and \( \beta_1 \)) and set these derivatives to zero. These conditions are known as the ""normal equations.""\n\n3. **First Normal Equation:** When we take the derivative with respect to \( \beta_0 \) and set it to zero, we obtain the first normal equation: \( \sum_{i=1}^{10} (y_i - \beta_0 - \beta_1 x_i) = 0 \). This equation essentially states that the sum of the residuals multiplied by 1 (since the derivative with respect to \( \beta_0 \) treats \( \beta_0 \) as a constant term) must be zero for the residuals to be minimized.\n\n4. **Interpreting the Normal Equation:** The equation \( \sum_{i=1}^{10} (y_i - \beta_0 - \beta_1 x_i) = 0 \) can be rewritten as \( \sum_{i=1}^{10} e_i = 0 \), where \( e_i = y_i - \hat{y}_i \).

It is calculated using the formula:\n\n     \[\n     t = \frac{\bar{X}_1 - \bar{X}_2}{\sqrt{S_p^2 \left(\frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2}\right)}}\n     \]\n\n     where \( S_p^2 \) is the pooled variance, calculated as:\n\n     \[\n     S_p^2 = \frac{(n_1 - 1)S_1^2 + (n_2 - 1)S_2^2}{n_1 + n_2 - 2}\n     \]\n\n     Plugging in the numbers:\n     - Pooled variance:\n       \[\n       S_p^2 = \frac{(14 - 1)(4)^2 + (12 - 1)(5)^2}{14 + 12 - 2} = \frac{13 \times 16 + 11 \times 25}{24} = \frac{208 + 275}{24} = \frac{483}{24} \approx 20.125\n       \]\n     - Standard error:\n       \[\n       \sqrt{20.125 \left(\frac{1}{14} + \frac{1}{12}\right)} \approx \sqrt{20.125 \times 0.1595} \approx \sqrt{3.209} \approx 1.792\n       \]\n     - Test statistic:\n       \[\n       t = \frac{72 - 68}{1.792} \approx \frac{4}{1.792} \approx 2.236\n       \]\n\n6. **Determining Degrees of Freedom:**\n   - Degrees of freedom (df) for the pooled t-test is \( n_1 + n_2 - 2 = 14 + 12 - 2 = 24 \).\n\n7. **Finding the Critical t-Value or P-Value:**\n   - For a two-tailed test at the 0.05 significance level with 24 degrees of freedom, the critical t-values are approximately ±2.064.\n   - Alternatively, we can find the p-value associated with our calculated t-statistic of 2.236. Consulting a t-distribution table or using software, the p-value is roughly 0.035.\n\n8. **Making the Decision:**\n   - Since the calculated t-statistic (2.236) is greater than the critical value (2.064), and the p-value (0.035) is less than the significance level of 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis.\n\n9. **Conclusion:**\n   - There is statistically significant evidence at the 5% level to conclude that there is a difference in the mean scores of the two groups of students on the trigonometric problem.\n\nThis informal proof outlines the logical steps taken to perform a two-sample t-test, leading to the conclusion that the performance difference between the two groups is statistically significant.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\n-- Define the groups and their properties\ndef group1 : List Nat := [72, 70, 68, 71, 72, 69, 70, 71, 72, 68, 70, 71, 72, 69]\ndef group2 : List Nat := [68, 66, 65, 67, 68, 66, 67, 68, 69, 66, 67, 68]\n\n-- Define the mean and standard deviation functions\ndef mean (l : List Nat) : Float :=\n  let sum := l.foldl (· + ·) 0\n  let count := l.length\n  if count = 0 then 0 else (sum : Float) / (count : Float)\n\ndef stdDev (l : List Nat) : Float :=\n  let m := mean l\n  let variance := l.foldl (fun acc x => acc + (x - m)^2) 0\n  let count := l.length\n  if count = 0 then 0 else Real.sqrt (variance / (count : Float))\n\n-- Perform the t-test\ndef tTest (g1 g2 : List Nat) : Float :=\n  let m1 := mean g1\n  let m2 := mean g2\n  let s1 := stdDev g1\n  let s2 := stdDev g2\n  let n1 := g1.length\n  let n2 := g2.length\n  let sp := Real.sqrt ((n1 - 1) * s1^2 + (n2 - 1) * s2^2) / (n1 + n2 - 2)\n  let se := Real.sqrt (sp^2 * (1 / n1 + 1 / n2))\n  (m1 - m2) / se\n\n-- Calculate the t-statistic\ndef tStatistic := tTest group1 group2\n\n-- Output the t-statistic\n#eval tStatistic\n```",False

To prove that \( n \) is a multiple of 2, we can proceed as follows:\n\nSince \( n \) is a multiple of 4, by definition, there exists some integer \( k \) such that:\n\[\nn = 4k\n\]\nNotice that 4 itself is equal to \( 2 \times 2 \). Therefore, we can rewrite \( n \) as:\n\[\nn = 2 \times 2 \times k = 2 \times (2k)\n\]\nLet’s define \( m = 2k \). Since \( k \) is an integer, \( m \) is also an integer.

We'll perform hypothesis tests for each component to see if the sample means deviate significantly from the population means.\n\n**1. Understanding the Population and Sample:**\n- **Population Means:** The average real part is 5, and the average imaginary part is 3.\n- **Sample Statistics:** From 30 complex numbers, the sample mean of the real parts is 4.8 with a standard deviation of 1, and the sample mean of the imaginary parts is 2.9 with a standard deviation of 0.8.\n\n**2. Setting Up Hypotheses:**\nFor both the real and imaginary parts, we set up the following hypotheses:\n- **Null Hypothesis (H₀):** The sample mean is equal to the population mean.\n  - For real parts: H₀: μ_real = 5\n  - For imaginary parts: H₀: μ_imaginary = 3\n- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):** The sample mean is not equal to the population mean.\n  - For real parts: H₁: μ_real ≠ 5\n  - For imaginary parts: H₁: μ_imaginary ≠ 3\n\n**3. Choosing the Appropriate Test:**\nGiven that we have the sample means, standard deviations, and sample size, we can use the **t-test** for each component. The t-test is appropriate here because the sample size is relatively small (n = 30), and we assume that the population distribution is approximately normal.\n\n**4. Calculating the Test Statistics:**\nFor each part, the t-statistic is calculated as:\n\[ t = \frac{\text{Sample Mean} - \text{Population Mean}}{\text{(Sample Standard Deviation)} / \sqrt{n}} \]\n- **Real Parts:**\n  \[ t_{real} = \frac{4.8 - 5}{1 / \sqrt{30}} \approx \frac{-0.2}{0.1826} \approx -1.095 \]\n- **Imaginary Parts:**\n  \[ t_{imaginary} = \frac{2.9 - 3}{0.8 / \sqrt{30}} \approx \frac{-0.1}{0.1463} \approx -0.684 \]\n\n**5. Determining the Critical t-Value:**\nAt a 5% significance level and with 29 degrees of freedom (n - 1), the critical t-value for a two-tailed test is approximately ±2.045.\n\n**6. Comparing the Test Statistics to Critical Values:**\n- **Real Parts:** The calculated t-value of -1.095 is within the range of -2.045 to +2.045.\n- **Imaginary Parts:** The calculated t-value of -0.684 is also within the range of -2.045 to +2.045.\n\n**7.

This means there is no statistically significant difference between the sample means and the population means at the 5% level of significance.\n\n**8.

An inscribed sphere touches all six faces of the box. For the sphere to touch each pair of opposite faces, the distances from the center of the sphere to these faces must be equal in each dimension.\n\n2. **Determining the Sphere's Radius:**\n   \n   - **Along the Length \( a \):** The sphere touches both the front and back faces.

For a continuous function \( f(t) \) defined on the interval \([0, \infty)\), the Laplace transform \( F(s) \) is given by:\n\n\[\nF(s) = \mathcal{L}\{f(t)\} = \int_{0}^{\infty} f(t) e^{-st} \, dt\n\]\n\nOur goal is to show that \( F(s) \) is a continuous function of \( s \). To establish continuity, we need to demonstrate that for every point \( s_0 \) in the domain of \( s \), the limit of \( F(s) \) as \( s \) approaches \( s_0 \) is equal to \( F(s_0) \). In other words, we want to show:\n\n\[\n\lim_{s \to s_0} F(s) = F(s_0)\n\]\n\nLet's consider the difference between \( F(s) \) and \( F(s_0) \):\n\n\[\n|F(s) - F(s_0)| = \left| \int_{0}^{\infty} f(t) e^{-st} \, dt - \int_{0}^{\infty} f(t) e^{-s_0 t} \, dt \right|\n\]\n\nBy combining the integrals, this becomes:\n\n\[\n|F(s) - F(s_0)| = \left| \int_{0}^{\infty} f(t) \left( e^{-st} - e^{-s_0 t} \right) dt \right|\n\]\n\nUsing the property that the absolute value of an integral is less than or equal to the integral of the absolute value, we have:\n\n\[\n|F(s) - F(s_0)| \leq \int_{0}^{\infty} |f(t)| \cdot |e^{-st} - e^{-s_0 t}| \, dt\n\]\n\nSince \( f(t) \) is continuous on \([0, \infty)\) and the Laplace transform \( F(s) \) exists, we can assume that \( f(t) \) does not grow faster than an exponential function, ensuring the integral converges.\n\nNext, observe that the difference \( |e^{-st} - e^{-s_0 t}| \) can be controlled as \( s \) approaches \( s_0 \). Specifically, for sufficiently close values of \( s \) and \( s_0 \), the exponential functions \( e^{-st} \) and \( e^{-s_0 t} \) become increasingly similar. Mathematically, as \( s \to s_0 \), the term \( |e^{-st} - e^{-s_0 t}| \) tends to zero for each fixed \( t \).\n\nMoreover, because \( f(t) \) is continuous and the exponential functions are uniformly continuous over any bounded interval, the integrand \( |f(t)| \cdot |e^{-st} - e^{-s_0 t}| \) can be made uniformly small across the entire range of integration by choosing \( s \) sufficiently close to \( s_0 \).\n\nBy the Dominated Convergence Theorem, since \( |f(t)| \cdot |e^{-st} - e^{-s_0 t}| \) is dominated by an integrable function (for example, \( |f(t)| \cdot e^{-s_{\text{min}} t} \), where \( s_{\text{min}} \) is the minimum of \( s \) and \( s_0 \)), we can interchange the limit and the integral. This allows us to conclude that:\n\n\[\n\lim_{s \to s_0} |F(s) - F(s_0)| = 0\n\]\n\nTherefore, \( \lim_{s \to s_0} F(s) = F(s_0) \), which means that \( F(s) \) is continuous at \( s_0 \).

For a continuous function \( f(t) \) defined for all \( t \geq 0 \), the Laplace transform \( F(s) \) is given by:\n\n\[\nF(s) = \int_{0}^{\infty} f(t) e^{-st} \, dt\n\]\n\nHere, \( s \) is a complex number with a real part large enough to ensure the integral converges.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding Continuity of \( f(t) \) and the Exponential Function**\n\nSince \( f(t) \) is continuous for all \( t \geq 0 \), and the exponential function \( e^{-st} \) is smooth (infinitely differentiable) with respect to \( s \), the product \( f(t) e^{-st} \) behaves nicely. Specifically, for each fixed \( t \), the function \( e^{-st} \) changes smoothly as \( s \) varies, and multiplying by the continuous \( f(t) \) preserves this smoothness.\n\n**Step 2: Investigating Changes in \( s \) and Their Effect on \( F(s) \)**\n\nTo show that \( F(s) \) is continuous, we need to demonstrate that small changes in \( s \) lead to small changes in \( F(s) \). Suppose we have two points \( s \) and \( s_0 \) in the domain where the Laplace transform exists. We can look at the difference between their transforms:\n\n\[\n|F(s) - F(s_0)| = \left| \int_{0}^{\infty} f(t) \left( e^{-st} - e^{-s_0 t} \right) dt \right|\n\]\n\nUsing the properties of integrals and absolute values, this can be bounded by:\n\n\[\n|F(s) - F(s_0)| \leq \int_{0}^{\infty} |f(t)| \left| e^{-st} - e^{-s_0 t} \right| dt\n\]\n\n**Step 3: Ensuring the Integral Remains Small**\n\nBecause \( f(t) \) is continuous and, typically, of exponential order (meaning there exists some constant \( a \) such that \( |f(t)| \leq M e^{at} \) for some \( M \) and all \( t \)), the integral converges. Moreover, as \( s \) approaches \( s_0 \), the difference \( |e^{-st} - e^{-s_0 t}| \) becomes small for each fixed \( t \). Essentially, the exponential functions \( e^{-st} \) and \( e^{-s_0 t} \) become closer to each other as \( s \) gets closer to \( s_0 \).\n\n**Step 4: Applying Uniform Convergence**\n\nBecause the convergence of \( e^{-st} \) to \( e^{-s_0 t} \) is uniform over compact intervals of \( t \), and \( f(t) \) does not introduce any discontinuities or singularities, we can interchange the limit and the integral (a justification often provided by the Dominated Convergence Theorem). This interchange allows us to conclude that:\n\n\[\n\lim_{s \to s_0} F(s) = F(s_0)\n\]\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSince the difference \( |F(s) - F(s_0)| \) can be made arbitrarily small by taking \( s \) sufficiently close to \( s_0 \), we conclude that \( F(s) \) is continuous at every point \( s_0 \) where the Laplace transform exists. Therefore, the Laplace transform of a continuous function \( f(t) \) is itself a continuous function \( F(s) \).","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\n-- Define the Laplace transform of a function\ndef laplaceTransform (f : ℝ → ℂ) (s : ℂ) : ℂ :=\n  ∫ (t : ℝ) in set.Ioi 0, f t * exp (-s * t)\n\n-- Assume f is a continuous function\nvariable (f : ℝ → ℂ) (hf : Continuous f)\n\n-- Theorem: The Laplace transform of a continuous function is continuous\ntheorem laplace_transform_continuous : Continuous (laplaceTransform f) := by\n  -- Use the fact that the integral of a continuous function is continuous\n  apply continuous_of_continuous_on_of_isCompact\n  -- The set of integration is (0, ∞), which is an open set\n  exact isOpen_Ioi\n  -- The function inside the integral is continuous\n  exact continuous_on_const.mul (continuous_on_exp.comp (continuous_on_id.neg.mul continuous_on_const))\n  -- The set of integration is compact\n  exact isCompact_Ioi\n```",False

The Extreme Value Theorem tells us that a continuous function on a closed interval attains both its minimum and maximum values within that interval.

Given that \( f \) is differentiable, the existence of partial derivatives \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(a, b) = 0 \) and \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(a, b) = 0 \) suggests that \( (a, b) \) is a critical point. However, having zero partial derivatives alone does not guarantee that \( f \) has a local minimum or maximum at \( (a, b) \). \n\nTo establish that \( (a, b) \) is indeed a local extremum, we need to analyze how \( f \) behaves in all directions around this point. This involves considering changes in both the \( x \) and \( y \) directions simultaneously. One effective method is to use the second derivative test, which examines the second-order partial derivatives to determine the nature of the critical point.\n\nAssume that the second partial derivatives of \( f \) at \( (a, b) \) exist and are continuous. We then construct the Hessian matrix at \( (a, b) \):\n\n\[\nH = \begin{bmatrix}\n\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2}(a, b) & \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x \partial y}(a, b) \\\n\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y \partial x}(a, b) & \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y^2}(a, b)\n\end{bmatrix}\n\]\n\nThe determinant of the Hessian, \( D = \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2} \cdot \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y^2} - \left( \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x \partial y} \right)^2 \), plays a crucial role in determining the nature of the critical point:\n\n1. **If \( D > 0 \)** and \( \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2}(a, b) > 0 \), then \( f \) has a **local minimum** at \( (a, b) \).\n2. **If \( D > 0 \)** and \( \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2}(a, b) < 0 \), then \( f \) has a **local maximum** at \( (a, b) \).\n3. **If \( D < 0 \)**, the point \( (a, b) \) is a **saddle point**, and \( f \) does not have a local extremum there.\n4. **If \( D = 0 \)**, the test is inconclusive, and further analysis is required.\n\nIn the specific case where the second partial derivatives satisfy \( D > 0 \) and either \( \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2}(a, b) > 0 \) or \( \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2}(a, b) < 0 \), we can confidently assert that \( f \) has a local extremum at \( (a, b) \). This conclusion follows because the positive definiteness or negative definiteness of the Hessian matrix ensures that \( f \) curves upwards or downwards in all directions around \( (a, b) \), respectively, thereby creating a local minimum or maximum.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that merely having zero first partial derivatives \( \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(a, b) = 0 \text{ and } \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(a, b) = 0 \right) \) does not automatically imply the existence of a local extremum. Without additional information about the second-order behavior of \( f \) near \( (a, b) \), the critical point could also be a saddle point or another type of non-extremal critical point.\n\nIn summary, while zero partial derivatives are a necessary condition for a local extremum, they are not sufficient on their own.

The median is essentially the ""middle"" value of a dataset, providing a central point that divides the data into two equal halves. However, the method to find this middle point varies depending on whether the number of elements in the set is odd or even.\n\nLet's consider a set containing an even number of elements, specifically \( n \) numbers where \( n \) is even. To find the median in this case, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Arrange the Numbers in Order:** Start by organizing all \( n \) numbers in ascending order, from the smallest to the largest. This ordered arrangement is crucial because the median depends on the positions of the numbers relative to each other.\n\n2. **Identify the Middle Positions:** Since \( n \) is even, there isn't a single middle number. Instead, there are two central positions in the ordered list:\n   - The \(\frac{n}{2}\)th position.\n   - The \(\left(\frac{n}{2} + 1\right)\)th position.\n\n   For example, if there are 10 numbers, the middle positions would be the 5th and 6th numbers in the ordered list.\n\n3. **Calculate the Median:** With two central numbers identified, the median is not one of these numbers but rather the average of them. This means you add the values of the \(\frac{n}{2}\)th and \(\left(\frac{n}{2} + 1\right)\)th numbers and then divide the sum by 2.\n\n   Mathematically, this is represented as:\n   \[\n   \text{Median} = \frac{\text{Value at } \frac{n}{2}\text{th position} + \text{Value at } \left(\frac{n}{2} + 1\right)\text{th position}}{2}\n   \]\n\n**Why This Method Works:**\n- **Balanced Representation:** By averaging the two middle numbers, we ensure that the median accurately reflects the central tendency of the dataset, especially when there's no single middle value due to an even count of numbers.\n- **Equal Division:** This approach divides the dataset into two equal halves, with exactly \( \frac{n}{2} \) numbers below the median and \( \frac{n}{2} \) numbers above it, maintaining balance.\n\nIn conclusion, when dealing with an even number of elements, taking the average of the two central numbers provides a precise and balanced measure of the dataset's median.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\n-- Given a set of n numbers, where n is an even number, prove that the median of the set is the average of the (n/2)th and ((n/2)+1)th number when the numbers are arranged in ascending order.\ntheorem median_of_even_n (n : ℕ) (hn : n % 2 = 0) (a : Fin n → ℕ) (h_sorted : List.Sorted (· ≤ ·) (List.ofFn a)) :\n  let sorted_list := List.ofFn a;\n  let median := (sorted_list.get?

Continuing with an example, if \( n = 6 \), the third and fourth numbers are the central pair.\n\nTo find a median that accurately represents the middle of the dataset when \( n \) is even, we take the average of these two central numbers. This averaging ensures that the median lies exactly between them, effectively balancing the dataset into two equal parts.

Since these vectors form the standard basis in a two-dimensional space, expressing the solution in this coordinate system involves representing it as a linear combination of these basis vectors.\n\n   Therefore, the particular solution can be written as:\n   \[\n   y(x) = \frac{1}{2} e^{x} \cdot v_1 + \frac{1}{2} e^{-x} \cdot v_2\n   \]\n   \n   Breaking it down:\n   - The term \( \frac{1}{2} e^{x} \cdot v_1 \) represents the component of the solution in the direction of \( v_1 \).\n   - The term \( \frac{1}{2} e^{-x} \cdot v_2 \) represents the component of the solution in the direction of \( v_2 \).\n\n5. **Final Solution:**\n   \n   Combining these, the solution to the differential equation \( y'' - y = 0 \) with the given initial conditions, expressed in the alternate coordinate system, is:\n   \[\n   y(x) = \frac{1}{2} e^{x} \cdot (1, 0) + \frac{1}{2} e^{-x} \cdot (0, 1)\n   \]\n   \n   This succinctly captures the behavior of the solution in both directions defined by \( v_1 \) and \( v_2 \), showcasing how the exponential growth and decay components contribute to the overall solution.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\n-- Define the differential equation and initial conditions\nvariable (y : ℝ → ℝ)\nvariable (y' : ℝ → ℝ)\nvariable (y'' : ℝ → ℝ)\n\n-- Define the boundary conditions\nvariable (y_0 : y 0 = 1)\nvariable (y'_0 : y' 0 = 0)\n\n-- Define the differential equation\nvariable (diff_eq : ∀ x, y'' x - y x = 0)\n\n-- Define the alternate coordinate system\nvariable (v1 : ℝ × ℝ)\nvariable (v2 : ℝ × ℝ)\n\n-- Define the solution in the alternate coordinate system\nvariable (sol : ℝ → ℝ × ℝ)\n\n-- Define the basis vectors\nvariable (basis : v1 = (1, 0) ∧ v2 = (0, 1))\n\n-- Define the solution function\nvariable (sol_func : sol x = (1 / 2) * Real.exp x • v1 + (1 / 2) * Real.exp (-x) • v2)\n\n-- Prove the solution satisfies the differential equation and initial conditions\ntheorem solution_satisfies_diff_eq_and_init_cond : \n  ∀ x, (sol x).1 = y x ∧ (sol x).2 = y' x ∧ y'' x = y x := by\n  intro x\n  have h1 : (sol x).1 = y x := by\n    rw [sol_func]\n    simp [basis]\n    rw [Real.exp_zero]\n    ring\n  have h2 : (sol x).2 = y' x := by\n    rw [sol_func]\n    simp [basis]\n    rw [Real.exp_zero]\n    ring\n  have h3 : y'' x = y x := by\n    rw [diff_eq]\n    ring\n  exact ⟨h1, h2, h3⟩\n```",False
