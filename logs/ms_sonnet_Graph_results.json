Let's call the lowest score L (which is 45) and the highest score H (which is 100).\n2. The average of just these two extreme scores is (L + H)/2.\n3. Every other score in the class must be between L and H by definition.\n4. When we add these middle scores to calculate the class average, each one contributes a value that is less than H and greater than L.\n5. Therefore, these middle scores \"pull\" the overall average toward the middle of the range.\n\nTo see why this must be true, imagine if we replaced all the middle scores with the average of L and H. This would give us the same result as just averaging L and H. But since the middle scores are actually less than H, replacing them with (L + H)/2 would increase their values on average. This means the true class average with the actual middle scores must be less than or equal to (L + H)/2.\n\nThis follows from the same principle we see in the context about means of unequal numbers - specifically that for any two unequal real numbers, their mean lies between them. When we extend this to a set of numbers, the overall mean must lie within the range of all values.\n\nTherefore, the class average cannot be greater than the average of the minimum and maximum scores, which is what we needed to prove.",

Here's how we can think about it:\n\n1. Every root of a polynomial gives us a factor of (x - r), where r is the root. This is because if r is a root, then (x - r) divides the polynomial evenly.\n\n2. Since we have n+1 distinct roots, let's call them r\u2081, r\u2082, ..., r\u2099\u208a\u2081, each of these gives us a factor (x - r\u1d62).\n\n3. Therefore, our polynomial P(x) must be divisible by the product (x - r\u2081)(x - r\u2082)...(x - r\u2099\u208a\u2081).\n\n4. This product is itself a polynomial of degree n+1, because each factor (x - r\u1d62) contributes degree 1, and we have n+1 such factors.\n\n5. But here's the contradiction: P(x) is supposed to be of degree n, yet it's divisible by a polynomial of degree n+1. The only way this is possible is if P(x) is identically zero.\n\nThis is because:\n- A non-zero polynomial cannot be divisible by a polynomial of higher degree\n- The degree of a product of polynomials is the sum of their degrees\n- Therefore, if P(x) were not the zero polynomial, it would need to have degree at least n+1 to accommodate all these factors\n\nSince we know P(x) has degree n, the only possible conclusion is that P(x) must be the zero polynomial.\nPrevious attempt failed with: invalid field notation, function 'Multiset.card' does not have argument with type (Multiset ...) that can be used, it must be explicit or implicit with a unique name\ninvalid field notation, function 'Multiset.card' does not have argument with type (Multiset ...) that can be used, it must be explicit or implicit with a unique name\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  P.degree\nP : Polynomial \u2124\nn : \u2115\nhP : P.degree = \u2191n\nh : sorryAx \u2115 true = n + 1\n\u22a2 sorryAx \u2115 true \u2264 n\nfailed to synthesize\n  LinearOrder (Polynomial \u2124)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nPlease revise the proof.",

First, let's define our sets:\n   - Let's call the set of students who wore red on Monday set M (with 10 students)\n   - Let's call the set of students who wore red on Tuesday set T (with 15 students)\n\n2. The question asks for the total number of students who wore red on either day, which means we're looking for the union of sets M and T.\n\n3.

Or multiply each dimension by 2 and add them: (2 \u00d7 length) + (2 \u00d7 width)\n\nIn this case, we have:\n- Length = 10 feet\n- Width = 6 feet\n\nUsing either method:\n- Method 1: 10 + 10 + 6 + 6 = 32 feet\n- Method 2: (2 \u00d7 10) + (2 \u00d7 6) = 20 + 12 = 32 feet\n\nTherefore, John will need 32 feet of fencing to completely enclose his rectangular garden.\n\nThis answer makes sense because:\n1.

It's the probability of remembering at least x pages after studying 3 pages for one hour. This is a decreasing function because the probability of remembering more pages is always less than or equal to the probability of remembering fewer pages.\n\n2) For each page studied, there's an 0.8 probability of remembering it. Since the student studies 3 pages per hour, we need to consider how this relates to remembering x pages.\n\n3) This scenario follows a binomial probability distribution because:\n   - Each page has two possible outcomes (remembered or not)\n   - The probability is constant (0.8) for each page\n   - The pages are independent events\n\n4) When x = 3, f(x) represents the probability of remembering all 3 pages studied. The derivative at this point represents how quickly this probability is changing.\n\n5) The derivative of f(x) being constant means the probability function f(x) must be linear. This makes sense because:\n   - Between 0 and 3 pages, the probability decreases linearly\n   - Beyond 3 pages, the probability is 0 (can't remember more pages than studied)\n\n6) Given that the student studies 3 pages and each has 0.8 probability of being remembered, the expected number of pages remembered is 3 * 0.8 = 2.4 pages.\n\n7) Therefore, the function f(x) must be a straight line from f(0) = 1 to f(2.4) = 0.5 to f(3) = 0, making it a linear function with a constant negative slope.\n\n8) The slope (derivative) would be -1/3, because:\n   - The function drops from 1 to 0 over a span of 3 pages\n   - This gives us a constant rate of change of -1/3\n\nTherefore, the derivative of f(x) when x = 3 is -1/3, and this is also the constant value of the derivative for all x between 0 and 3.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  f x\nx : \u211d\nhx : x \u2264 3\nh1 : f x = 1 - 0.8 * x / 3\n\u22a2 deriv f x = -0.8 / 3\nunsolved goals\nh : deriv f 3 = -0.8 / 3\n\u22a2 False\nPlease revise the proof.",

This is actually Rolle's Theorem, and here's how we can understand it intuitively:\n\nFirst, let's think about what we know:\n- We have a function f(x) that's continuous over [a,b]\n- The function is differentiable over (a,b)\n- The function starts and ends at the same height (f(a) = f(b))\n\nThe proof works by considering what must happen between points a and b. Since the function starts and ends at the same height, there are only two possible scenarios:\n\n1. Either the function stays completely flat (constant) between a and b\n2. Or the function must go up and down (or down and up) to get back to the same height\n\nIn the first case (if the function is constant), we know from the derivative of a constant function that f'(x) = 0 everywhere in (a,b), so we can pick any point c in (a,b) and we're done.\n\nIn the second case, the function must have at least one highest point (maximum) or lowest point (minimum) somewhere between a and b. This is guaranteed by the fact that f is continuous on a closed interval [a,b], so it must attain its maximum and minimum values (by the Extreme Value Theorem).\n\nIf this maximum or minimum occurs at some point c inside (a,b), then at this point the derivative must be zero. This is because:\n- At a maximum, the function can't be increasing or decreasing (otherwise it wouldn't be a maximum)\n- At a minimum, the function can't be increasing or decreasing (otherwise it wouldn't be a minimum)\n- Since the function is differentiable at c, the derivative must exist and equal zero at these turning points\n\nTherefore, in either case, we can find at least one point c in (a,b) where f'(c) = 0.\n\nThis proof relies on the fundamental connection between the behavior of a continuous function and its derivative at extreme points, combined with the fact that a function returning to its starting height must either be constant or have at least one extreme point in between.\nPrevious attempt failed with: function expected at\n  Ioo\nterm has type\n  ?m.95\nfunction expected at\n  Ioo\nterm has type\n  ?m.95\nfunction expected at\n  Ioo\nterm has type\n  x\u271d\nunsolved goals\nx\u271d : Sort u_1\nIoo : x\u271d\nf : \u211d \u2192 \u211d\na b : \u211d\nhab : a < b\nh : f a = f b\nhf : \u2200 x \u2208 ?m.2565 f a b hab h x, DifferentiableAt \u211d f x\n\u22a2 \u2203 c \u2208 ?m.2564 f a b hab h hf c, deriv f c = 0\nPlease revise the proof.",

However, it's easier to first find the slope of the line and then use that to construct the equation.\n\nTo find the slope, we can use the fact that it represents the rate of change between any two points on the line. Looking at our points (2,3) and (4,7):\n- The change in y is: 7 - 3 = 4\n- The change in x is: 4 - 2 = 2\n- Therefore, the slope is 4/2 = 2\n\nThis means that for every horizontal unit we move, we go up 2 vertical units.\n\nNow that we have the slope, we can use either point to find the complete equation. The line must pass through (2,3), so we can plug this point and the slope into the point-slope form of a line:\ny - 3 = 2(x - 2)\n\nThis equation tells us that from the point (2,3), any other point on the line differs by a factor of 2 times the horizontal distance.\n\nWe can verify this works by checking that (4,7) satisfies our equation:\n- When x = 4, we get y - 3 = 2(4 - 2) = 2(2) = 4\n- Therefore y = 7, which matches our second point\n\nThis equation can be rewritten in the standard form by expanding:\ny - 3 = 2x - 4\ny = 2x - 1\n\nTherefore, the equation of the line passing through (2,3) and (4,7) is y = 2x - 1.\n\nThe reasoning is complete because we've:\n1.

First, let's understand what we're given. We have a vector field F whose divergence (\u2207 \u00b7 F) is zero everywhere in the region D. This means that at every point in the region, the \"spreading out\" or \"concentration\" of the vector field is zero - there are no sources or sinks.\n\n2. The divergence theorem tells us that for any smooth vector field, the flux across a closed surface equals the total divergence throughout the volume enclosed by that surface. Mathematically, this means:\n\n   \u222b\u222b_S F \u00b7 n dS = \u222b\u222b\u222b_D (\u2207 \u00b7 F) dV\n\n3. In our case, we know that \u2207 \u00b7 F = 0 everywhere in D. This is crucial because it means that when we integrate the divergence over the entire volume D, we're integrating zero everywhere.\n\n4. When we integrate zero over any region, no matter how large or what shape it is, we get zero as the result. Therefore:\n\n   \u222b\u222b\u222b_D (\u2207 \u00b7 F) dV = 0\n\n5. Combining this with the divergence theorem from step 2, we can conclude that:\n\n   \u222b\u222b_S F \u00b7 n dS = 0\n\nThe intuitive meaning is that if a vector field has zero divergence everywhere (meaning it's \"incompressible\"), then whatever flow enters the region through the boundary surface must exactly equal the flow that exits - there can be no net flux across the boundary.\n\nThis result is similar to the theorem about the total vector area of a closed surface being zero, as both deal with integration over closed surfaces and both result in zero.

This is a fundamental principle from probability theory.\n\nIn our 3D case, we have a vector field F(x,y,z) that serves as the probability density function over a solid region A. Each point (x,y,z) in A has an associated density value given by F(x,y,z), which represents the relative likelihood of the random variable X taking on values near that point.\n\nThe expected value needs to account for:\n1. Every possible point in the region A\n2. The density value at each point\n3. The actual value at each point\n\nWhen we use a triple integral \u222b\u222b\u222b_A F(x,y,z) dV, we are precisely:\n- Covering every point in the solid region A (that's what the triple integral does)\n- Multiplying each point's coordinates by its density value F(x,y,z)\n- Adding up (integrating) all these products over the entire region\n\nThis is exactly what the definition of expectation calls for - we're multiplying each possible outcome by its probability (density) and summing over all possibilities. The only difference is that instead of a single integral, we need three integrals because we're working in three-dimensional space.\n\nThe volume element dV represents an infinitesimal volume around each point, which is analogous to the dx term in the one-dimensional case. Just as the one-dimensional expectation integrates over all possible values on a line, this triple integral integrates over all possible points in our solid region.\n\nTherefore, E(X) = \u222b\u222b\u222b_A F(x,y,z) dV is the natural extension of the one-dimensional expectation formula to three dimensions, capturing the expected value of our random variable X over the given region A.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unexpected token '\u222b'; expected ',' or 'in'\nPlease revise the proof.",

To find x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation.\n\nLooking at the equation, we have terms with x on both sides (5x and 3x). To simplify this, we should first get all terms with x on one side and all other numbers on the other side. The natural approach is to subtract 3x from both sides of the equation to get all x terms on the left.\n\nWhen we do this, the left side becomes 2x + 2 (because 5x - 3x = 2x), and the right side becomes 6.\n\nNow we have 2x + 2 = 6.

The key idea is to break this down into components and use the basic properties of real numbers.\n\nFirst, let's understand what we're trying to prove. When we multiply a scalar c by the sum of two vectors (v + w), this should give us the same result as if we multiplied c by each vector separately and then added the results.\n\nHere's how we can think about this:\n\n1. When we have two vectors v and w in R^n, each vector has n components. Let's call them v\u2081, v\u2082, ..., v\u2099 and w\u2081, w\u2082, ..., w\u2099.\n\n2. When we add vectors v and w, we add their corresponding components. So (v + w) gives us a vector whose components are (v\u2081 + w\u2081), (v\u2082 + w\u2082), and so on.\n\n3. When we multiply a vector by a scalar c, we multiply each component by c.\n\n4. So, on the left side of our equation, c*(v + w) means we're multiplying c by each component of (v + w). This gives us:\n   - In the first component: c(v\u2081 + w\u2081)\n   - In the second component: c(v\u2082 + w\u2082)\n   And so on...\n\n5. On the right side, c*v + c*w means:\n   - First multiply c by each component of v: (cv\u2081, cv\u2082, ...)\n   - Then multiply c by each component of w: (cw\u2081, cw\u2082, ...)\n   - Then add these results: (cv\u2081 + cw\u2081, cv\u2082 + cw\u2082, ...)\n\n6. The equality holds because in each component, we're using the distributive property of real numbers: c(v\u1d62 + w\u1d62) = cv\u1d62 + cw\u1d62\n\nSince this equality holds for each component, and vectors are equal if and only if all their corresponding components are equal, the vectors c*(v + w) and c*v + c*w must be equal.\n\nThis proof relies on two fundamental ideas:\n- The component-wise nature of vector operations\n- The distributive property of real numbers\nPrevious attempt failed with: unsolved goals\ncase h\nn : \u2115\nv w : Fin n \u2192 \u211d\nc : \u211d\ni : Fin n\n\u22a2 c * (v i + w i) = c * v i + c * w i\nPlease revise the proof.",

In other words, the length is 1.5 times the width.\n\n2. We're given that the width is 120 feet. Since we know the ratio relationship between length and width, we can find the length by multiplying the width by the ratio factor.\n\n3.

The key insight is to adapt the definition of the derivative to vector-valued functions and show that A naturally emerges as the linear transformation that best approximates f near any point.\n\nThe main steps in the reasoning are:\n\n1) First, recall that the derivative at a point, when it exists, is the linear transformation that best approximates the function near that point. In other words, it's the limit of the difference quotient as we approach the point.\n\n2) For our function f(x) = Ax, let's consider what happens when we look at the difference quotient at any point x with an increment h:\n\n   [f(x + h) - f(x)] / ||h||\n\n3) When we expand this using the definition of f:\n   - f(x + h) = A(x + h) = Ax + Ah\n   - f(x) = Ax\n   So the numerator becomes (Ax + Ah - Ax) = Ah\n\n4) Therefore, our difference quotient is simply:\n   Ah / ||h||\n\n5) The crucial observation is that this is already a linear transformation (namely A) applied to h/||h||. There's no need to take a limit because the expression is already exactly A, regardless of how small h becomes.\n\n6) This means that A itself is the derivative of f at every point x, because:\n   - It's a linear transformation\n   - It exactly represents how f changes in any direction\n   - There's no approximation involved - the linear transformation A perfectly describes the function's behavior\n\nThis proves that the derivative of f(x) = Ax is simply A at every point x in R^2, which is what we wanted to show.\n\nThe beauty of this proof is that it shows how linear transformations are their own derivatives - they are already the best linear approximation of themselves because they are linear to begin with.\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  A.mulVec x.1\nargument\n  x.1\nhas type\n  \u211d : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  Fin 2 \u2192 \u211d : Type\napplication type mismatch\n  A.mulVec x.2\nargument\n  x.2\nhas type\n  \u211d : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  Fin 2 \u2192 \u211d : Type\nPlease revise the proof.",

This allows us to connect this problem to what we know about derivatives of single-variable functions.\n\nHere's the logical flow:\n\n1. First, let's understand what we're looking at. The left side of the equation is a limit of a difference quotient where we're only varying x (by adding h) while keeping y fixed. This is exactly how we define derivatives for single-variable functions.\n\n2. Meanwhile, the right side (\u2202f/\u2202x) is defined as the partial derivative with respect to x, which by definition is found by treating y as a constant and differentiating with respect to x.\n\n3. When we fix y and look at how f changes along the x-direction, we're essentially looking at a slice of the function parallel to the x-axis. Along this slice, f behaves just like a single-variable function.\n\n4. Since we're given that the partial derivatives exist and are continuous on \u211d\u00b2, we know that for any fixed y:\n   - The function is well-behaved along the x-direction\n   - The limit we're looking at exists\n   - The function is differentiable with respect to x\n\n5. The difference quotient [f(x+h, y) - f(x,y)]/h represents the average rate of change of f over a small interval h in the x-direction, while keeping y constant.\n\n6. As h approaches 0, this average rate of change approaches the instantaneous rate of change at the point (x,y), which is precisely what \u2202f/\u2202x represents at that point.\n\n7. The continuity of the partial derivatives ensures that this limit process is well-behaved and that the limit actually equals the partial derivative.\n\nTherefore, the limit of the difference quotient as h approaches 0 must equal the partial derivative \u2202f/\u2202x at the point (x,y), because they are fundamentally describing the same thing: the instantaneous rate of change of f in the x-direction at a point where y is held constant.\n\nThis result is essentially a restatement of the definition of the partial derivative, viewed through the lens of limits, and confirms that the partial derivative \u2202f/\u2202x behaves just like an ordinary derivative when we restrict our attention to changes in x alone.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unexpected token '\u2202'; expected term\nunexpected token '\u2202'; expected term\nunexpected token '('; expected ':' or ']'\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

This makes sense intuitively since conjugation only changes the sign of the imaginary part, which doesn't affect the distance from the origin (the magnitude).\n\nHere's the reasoning step by step:\n\n1. First, recall that for any complex number z, its conjugate z\u0304 has the same magnitude as z. That is, |z\u0304| = |z|.\n   This is because if z = a + bi, then z\u0304 = a - bi, and both have magnitude \u221a(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2).\n\n2. Therefore, when we multiply |z|\u00b7|z\u0304|, we are actually multiplying |z| by itself:\n   |z|\u00b7|z\u0304| = |z|\u00b7|z|\n\n3. By definition, multiplying a number by itself gives us its square:\n   |z|\u00b7|z| = |z|\u00b2\n\n4. Thus, we can conclude that |z|\u00b7|z\u0304| = |z|\u00b2\n\nThis proof is quite straightforward once we recognize that conjugation preserves magnitude. The result follows directly from this fundamental property of complex conjugates and the definition of magnitude.\n\nThe proof also aligns with our geometric intuition about complex numbers: since conjugation merely reflects a complex number across the real axis, it doesn't change the number's distance from the origin (its magnitude). Therefore, multiplying these equal magnitudes gives us the square of the original magnitude.\nPrevious attempt failed with: invalid field 'conj', the environment does not contain 'Complex.conj'\n  z\nhas type\n  \u2102\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  Complex.abs ((starRingEnd \u2102) ?z)\nz : \u2102\n\u22a2 Complex.abs z * Complex.abs (sorryAx \u2102 true) = Complex.abs z ^ 2\nPlease revise the proof.",

In this case:\n\nWe have a right triangle ABC where:\n- Angle ABC is 90 degrees (given)\n- Side AB is 6 cm (given)\n- Side BC is 8 cm (given)\n- Side AC is the hypotenuse (since it's opposite to the right angle)\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, we can say that:\nAC\u00b2 = AB\u00b2 + BC\u00b2\n\nWe can solve this by:\n1.

This proof has two parts since ordinal multiplication is not commutative - we need to show both that x * 1 = x and 1 * x = x.\n\nFor x * 1:\nThe idea is straightforward. When we multiply an ordinal x by 1, we're essentially adding x to itself 0 times and then adding x one more time. This is because 1 is defined as the successor of 0. When we add x zero times, we get 0, and then when we add x one more time, we simply get x. Therefore x * 1 = x.\n\nFor 1 * x:\nThis part requires transfinite induction because we need to show it works for all possible ordinal numbers x. Here's how it works:\n\n1. First, we show it's true for zero: 1 * 0 = 0 by the definition of ordinal multiplication.\n\n2. For any ordinal number x where we assume 1 * x = x (our inductive hypothesis), we can show that 1 * (x+1) = (1 * x) + 1 = x + 1. This covers all successor ordinals.\n\n3. For limit ordinals (ordinals that aren't zero and aren't successors), if we assume the equation works for all smaller ordinals, then it must work for the limit ordinal too. This is because multiplication at a limit ordinal is defined as the union of the products of all smaller ordinals.\n\nThe combination of these three cases - zero case, successor case, and limit case - shows that 1 * x = x holds for all ordinal numbers x.\n\nTherefore, multiplication by 1 (from either direction) always returns the original number, just as our intuition from regular arithmetic would suggest.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'induction' failed, major premise type is not an inductive type \n  Quot Setoid.r\ncase h\nx : Ordinal.{u_1}\nIH : \u2200 k < x, k * 1 = k\n\u22a2 x * 1 = x\nPlease revise the proof.",

We know that:\n1. The area of a circle is A(r) = \u03c0r\u00b2\n2. The circumference of a circle is C(r) = 2\u03c0r\n3. We need to find dA/dr and show it relates to the circumference\n\nTo find the rate of change of area with respect to radius, we can imagine what happens when we increase the radius by a tiny amount. When we do this, the circle grows by adding a very thin band around its edge. This thin band is essentially like unwrapping the circumference and giving it a small width.\n\nThe derivative dA/dr represents how quickly the area changes as we make small changes to the radius. When we calculate this derivative:\n\nStarting with A(r) = \u03c0r\u00b2, and using basic differentiation rules, we get:\ndA/dr = 2\u03c0r\n\nNow here's the key insight: this expression 2\u03c0r is exactly the circumference of the circle! \n\nSo what we've found is that at any given radius r:\ndA/dr = C(r)\n\nThis makes intuitive sense because when you increase the radius by a small amount, the new area added is approximately equal to the circumference multiplied by that small change in radius. The circumference represents the \"edge\" where new area is being added as the circle grows.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the rate of change of the area with respect to the radius is not just proportional to the circumference - it's exactly equal to it.

Since we have 4 and 2 as denominators, we can use 4 as our common denominator (since 4 is already a multiple of 2).\n\nTo convert 1/2 to an equivalent fraction with denominator 4, we multiply both top and bottom by 2, getting 2/4.

Here's the reasoning:\n\nFirst, since we're given that a \u2260 0, and we're dealing with exponents, we can be more specific: a must be positive (a > 0) because negative numbers can cause issues with real-valued exponents. This allows us to safely apply logarithms to both sides of the equation.\n\nIf we start with a^x = a^y, we can take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides. The natural logarithm is a one-to-one function, so if two expressions are equal, their logarithms must also be equal.\n\nWhen we take ln of both sides, we can use the logarithm property that ln(a^n) = n\u00b7ln(a) for any positive base a and any real exponent n. Applying this to both sides of our equation will give us:\n\nx\u00b7ln(a) = y\u00b7ln(a)\n\nNow, since a \u2260 0 and a > 0, we know that ln(a) \u2260 0 (because ln(a) is only zero when a = 1, and ln(a) is defined and non-zero for all other positive values of a).\n\nTherefore, we can divide both sides by ln(a) (since it's non-zero), which gives us:\nx = y\n\nThis completes our reasoning, showing that if a^x = a^y and a \u2260 0, then x must equal y.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'pow_bit0_neg'\nunknown identifier 'pow_bit0_neg'\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase inr\na : \u211d\nh : a \u2260 0\nx y : \u211d\nh_eq : a ^ x = a ^ y\nh_neg : \u00aca > 0\na_lt_zero : a < 0\nthis\u271d : a ^ x < 0\nthis : a ^ y < 0\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\napplication type mismatch\n  log_injOn_pos h_pos h_eq\nargument\n  h_eq\nhas type\n  a ^ x = a ^ y : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  ?m.1597 \u2208 Set.Ioi 0 : Prop\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, pattern is a metavariable\n  ?m.1597\nfrom equation\n  ?m.1597 = a\na : \u211d\nh : a \u2260 0\nx y : \u211d\nh_eq : a ^ x = a ^ y\nh_pos : a > 0\n\u22a2 x = y\nPlease revise the proof.",

Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. We start with the differential equation dy/dx = ky\n\n2. To solve this, we can separate the variables by moving all terms with y to one side and all terms with x to the other side:\n   - Divide both sides by y (assuming y \u2260 0) to get:\n   - (1/y)dy = k dx\n\n3. Now we can integrate both sides:\n   - On the left side, we know that the integral of 1/y with respect to y is ln|y|\n   - On the right side, we integrate k dx which gives us kx + C\u2081 (where C\u2081 is some constant)\n   - So we have: ln|y| = kx + C\u2081\n\n4. To solve for y, we can apply the exponential function (e^x) to both sides:\n   - Since e^(ln|y|) = y (for y > 0), and e^(kx + C\u2081) = e^(kx) \u00b7 e^(C\u2081)\n   - We get: y = e^(kx) \u00b7 e^(C\u2081)\n\n5. We can simplify this by letting C = e^(C\u2081), where C is a new constant:\n   - This gives us our final solution: y = Ce^(kx)\n\n6. We can verify this is correct by differentiating y = Ce^(kx):\n   - dy/dx = Cke^(kx) = k(Ce^(kx)) = ky\n   - This confirms our solution satisfies the original differential equation\n\nThis solution represents all possible functions that satisfy the given differential equation, where C can be any non-zero constant.

We need to find the tangent line at any point (t, f(t))\n\nThe key insight is that for a parametric curve, the tangent line's slope at any point can be found by taking the ratio of the derivatives of the y-component to the x-component.\n\nIn our case:\n- The x-component of \u03b3(t) is just t, so its derivative is 1\n- The y-component is f(t), and its derivative with respect to t is f'(t)\n- We're given that f'(t) = f(t)\n\nTherefore, at any point (t, f(t)), the slope of the tangent line is f'(t)/1 = f(t).\n\nNow, to get the equation of the tangent line, we can use the point-slope form of a line. We know:\n- A point on the line: (t, f(t))\n- The slope: f(t)\n\nUsing point-slope form, we can write:\ny - f(t) = f(t)(x - t)\n\nRearranging this gives us:\ny = f(t)(x - t) + f(t)\n\nThis matches exactly what we needed to prove.

A quadratic equation has a repeated root when its discriminant equals zero, or equivalently, when the equation can be written as a perfect square trinomial.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. Looking at the given quadratic equation (a\u00b2)x\u00b2 - 2abx + b\u00b2, we can notice a pattern. The coefficients seem to be related:\n   - The coefficient of x\u00b2 is a\u00b2\n   - The coefficient of x is -2ab\n   - The constant term is b\u00b2\n\n2. This pattern strongly suggests that this might be a perfect square trinomial in the form (px - q)\u00b2, which always has a repeated root.\n\n3. If we expand (ax - b)\u00b2, we would get:\n   - a\u00b2x\u00b2 - 2abx + b\u00b2\n\n4. This is exactly the same as our original equation!\n\n5. Therefore, our original quadratic equation (a\u00b2)x\u00b2 - 2abx + b\u00b2 can be rewritten as (ax - b)\u00b2.\n\n6. Since this is a perfect square trinomial, it can only equal zero when ax - b = 0, which means x = b/a (when a \u2260 0).\n\n7. This single solution occurs twice (is repeated), which is what we needed to prove.\n\nThe key insight is recognizing that the coefficients form a perfect square pattern. This means the equation has a repeated root by its very structure, regardless of what real numbers a and b are (as long as a \u2260 0).\n\nTherefore, we have proven that the quadratic equation (a\u00b2)x\u00b2 - 2abx + b\u00b2 = 0 has a repeated root for any real numbers a and b (with a \u2260 0).\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. First, let's understand what happens near x = 2:\n   - When x is slightly less than 2, x\u00b2 is slightly less than 4\n   - When x is slightly more than 2, x\u00b2 is slightly more than 4\n   - As x gets closer and closer to 2, x\u00b2 gets closer and closer to 4\n\n2. To see why this happens, consider how squaring works:\n   - If we change x by a small amount from 2, say to 2 + h (where h is small)\n   - Then x\u00b2 = (2 + h)\u00b2 = 4 + 4h + h\u00b2\n   - When h is very small, h\u00b2 becomes even smaller (negligible)\n   - So the difference from 4 is mainly controlled by the term 4h\n   - As h gets closer to 0, 4h also gets closer to 0\n\n3. This means:\n   - For any small margin of error we want around 4\n   - We can find a small enough neighborhood around 2\n   - Such that all x values in this neighborhood will give x\u00b2 values within our desired margin of error around 4\n\n4. The function has no jumps or breaks at x = 2:\n   - The graph of x\u00b2 is smooth\n   - There are no sudden jumps as we approach x = 2\n   - The value we get by actually plugging in x = 2 matches the value we approach as x gets closer to 2\n\nTherefore, f(x) = x\u00b2 satisfies the intuitive definition of continuity at x = 2: small changes in x near 2 result in small changes in f(x) near 4, and there are no breaks or jumps in the function at this point.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  HDiv (Set \u2115) \u2115 ?m.6379\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\ntype mismatch\n  \u03b5 / 2\nhas type\n  ?m.6379 : outParam (Type ?u.4004)\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u03b5 \u2208 Filter.map (fun x => x ^ 2) (\ud835\udcdd 2) : Prop\nPlease revise the proof.",

In other words, we want to divide the segment into two equal parts, so the distances from the midpoint to each endpoint should be equal.\n\nLooking at the more general formula for dividing a line segment in the ratio m:n (from the context), we can see that when we want equal parts, m = n = 1.

Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to find the antiderivative (primitive) of x^2. From the Primitive of Power theorem given in the context, we know that for any power n \u2260 -1, the antiderivative of x^n is x^(n+1)/(n+1) plus a constant.\n\n2. In our case, n = 2, so:\n   - The antiderivative of x^2 is x^3/3 + C\n\n3. To evaluate the definite integral from 0 to 1, we:\n   - Evaluate the antiderivative at the upper limit (x = 1)\n   - Subtract the evaluation at the lower limit (x = 0)\n   - The arbitrary constant C cancels out in this subtraction\n\n4. At x = 1:\n   - (1)^3/3 = 1/3\n\n5. At x = 0:\n   - (0)^3/3 = 0\n\n6.

Here's how we can think about it:\n\nFirst, we know that X(t) is the fundamental solution matrix of the system dx/dt = Ax. This means that each column of X(t) is a solution to the system, and X(0) = I (the identity matrix). The matrix X(t) essentially tells us how any initial condition evolves over time under this differential equation.\n\nWhen we take the Laplace transform of the differential equation dx/dt = Ax, we're converting it from the time domain to the s-domain. A key property of the Laplace transform is that the transform of a derivative equals s times the transform of the function minus the initial value.\n\nSo, when we apply the Laplace transform to both sides of dX/dt = AX, we get:\n\n- The left side becomes sL{X(t)} - X(0)\n- The right side becomes AL{X(t)}\n\nSince X(0) = I, we can write:\nsL{X(t)} - I = AL{X(t)}\n\nThis is a matrix equation that we can solve for L{X(t)}. When we rearrange terms, we get:\n(sI - A)L{X(t)} = I\n\nThe matrix (sI - A) is invertible for appropriate values of s, and when we multiply both sides by its inverse, we get exactly what we want to prove: L{X(t)} = (sI - A)^(-1)\n\nThe reason this makes sense intuitively is that the Laplace transform converts our differential equation into an algebraic equation, and the inverse of (sI - A) captures all the information about how solutions evolve over time in a single matrix expression.\n\nThis result is particularly powerful because it gives us a direct way to compute the fundamental solution matrix using Laplace transforms, which can be easier than solving the differential equation directly in some cases.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  OfNat (Matrix n n \u211d) 1\nnumerals are polymorphic in Lean, but the numeral `1` cannot be used in a context where the expected type is\n  Matrix n n \u211d\ndue to the absence of the instance above\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  Inv (Matrix n n \u211d)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

First, by the Central Limit Theorem, for a sufficiently large sample size n, the sampling distribution of X\u0304 follows a normal distribution, regardless of the underlying population distribution.\n\n2. Second, as shown in the context, X\u0304 is an unbiased estimator of \u03bc, meaning the expected value of X\u0304 equals \u03bc.\n\n3. Third, a normal distribution is symmetric around its mean, and its probability density function (PDF) reaches its maximum value at the mean.\n\nGiven these properties, here's why the derivative of the PDF of X\u0304 must be zero at \u03bc:\n\nThe PDF of a normal distribution has a bell shape, with its peak centered at the mean. Since X\u0304 is normally distributed with mean \u03bc, its PDF will be of the form:\n\nf(X\u0304) = (1/\u221a(2\u03c0\u03c3\u00b2/n)) * e^(-(X\u0304-\u03bc)\u00b2/(2\u03c3\u00b2/n))\n\nAt the point where X\u0304 = \u03bc, we are exactly at the peak of this bell curve. This point represents the maximum value of the PDF. In calculus, we know that at any maximum point of a smooth function, the derivative must be zero.\n\nTherefore, when we take the derivative of the PDF with respect to X\u0304 and evaluate it at X\u0304 = \u03bc, we must get zero, as this point represents the transition from increasing to decreasing values of the PDF.\n\nThis makes intuitive sense because:\n- For values less than \u03bc, the PDF is increasing (positive derivative)\n- For values greater than \u03bc, the PDF is decreasing (negative derivative)\n- At \u03bc exactly, we have the turning point where the derivative changes sign, making it zero\n\nThis result is a direct consequence of the symmetry of the normal distribution and the fact that the sample mean is an unbiased estimator of the population mean.",

Since this value never changes:\n- The rate of change is always 0\n- This is true at every 10-minute interval\n- In 90 minutes, there are 9 intervals (90/10 = 9)\n\nTherefore, the rate of change will be 0 exactly 9 times during the game - at minutes 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, and 90.\n\nThe first part can be calculated as:\nC(14,11) = 14!/(11!(14-11)!) = 14!/(11!3!) = 364\n\nAnd the second part gives us 9 instances where the rate of change is 0.\n\nThis solution follows from the basic principles of combinations and the fact that a constant function has a derivative (rate of change) of zero everywhere.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  gameDuration / changeInterval\nh : gameDuration / changeInterval = 9\n\u22a2 numberOfIntervals = 9\nPlease revise the proof.",

The area we want to find is bounded by:\n   - The curve f(x) above\n   - The x-axis below\n   - The vertical lines x = a and x = b on the sides\n\n2. The key insight is that we can approximate this area by dividing it into thin vertical strips:\n   - Take any point x in [a,b]\n   - Consider a tiny width \u0394x\n   - Each strip forms a nearly rectangular shape\n   - The height of this strip is f(x)\n   - The approximate area of each strip is f(x)\u0394x\n\n3. As we make these strips thinner and thinner (\u0394x approaches 0):\n   - The approximation becomes more and more accurate\n   - The sum of all these tiny strip areas approaches the true area\n   - This is exactly what the definite integral represents\n\n4. The continuity of f is important because:\n   - It ensures there are no \"jumps\" in the curve\n   - The approximation by rectangles becomes arbitrarily accurate as strips get thinner\n   - The limit of the sum exists and equals the definite integral\n\n5. We can make this precise by showing:\n   - For any error margin \u03b5 > 0\n   - We can choose strips thin enough\n   - So that the difference between the true area and our approximation is less than \u03b5\n   - This means the area must equal the integral exactly\n\n6.

Since the definite integral \u222b[a to b] f(x)dx has all these same properties and gives the same value as our area approximation in the limit, they must be equal.\n\nTherefore, the area A under the curve must equal the definite integral \u222b[a to b] f(x)dx.\n\nThis proof relies on the fundamental connection between geometric area and the limiting process of Riemann sums that defines the definite integral.

        "informal_proof": "# Informal Proof:\n\nThis proof follows naturally from the definition of variance and its relationship to expectation. Let me explain the reasoning step by step:\n\nFirst, let's understand what we're trying to prove. We need to show that E((X - \u03bc)\u00b2) = \u03c3\u00b2, where \u03bc is the expected value of X and \u03c3\u00b2 is the variance of X. This is actually a fundamental definition of variance itself.\n\nThe key insight is that Var(X) and E((X - \u03bc)\u00b2) are actually the same thing. Here's why:\n\nBy definition, the variance of a random variable X is the expected value of the squared deviation from its mean. In other words, variance is precisely defined as E((X - \u03bc)\u00b2), where \u03bc = E(X).\n\nSo when we're given that Var(X) = \u03c3\u00b2, we're actually already given that E((X - \u03bc)\u00b2) = \u03c3\u00b2. These are equivalent statements - they're just different ways of writing the same mathematical concept.\n\nWe can also understand this intuitively:\n1. The term (X - \u03bc) represents how far each possible value of X deviates from the mean\n2. Squaring this term ((X - \u03bc)\u00b2) makes all deviations positive and gives more weight to larger deviations\n3. Taking the expectation E((X - \u03bc)\u00b2) gives us the average squared deviation\n4. This average squared deviation is precisely what we define as variance\n\nTherefore, the statement E((X - \u03bc)\u00b2) = \u03c3\u00b2 is true by definition, given that Var(X) = \u03c3\u00b2. This is one of the fundamental ways that variance is defined in probability theory, and it holds true regardless of the specific probability distribution of X.\n\nThe proof is essentially complete by recognizing that we're being asked to prove something that is true by definition - the variance of a random variable is equal to the expected value of its squared deviations from the mean.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'E'\n'sq' has already been declared\nfailed to synthesize\n  HSub (\u211d \u2192 \u211d) \u211d ?m.1511\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nThe rfl tactic failed.

We're given that this ratio is k, meaning AB/DE = BC/EF = AC/DF = k.\n\nHere's how we can think about this:\n\nFirst, recall that the area of a triangle can be calculated using the formula (base \u00d7 height)/2. For any triangle, we can choose any side as the base, and the height would be the perpendicular distance from the opposite vertex to that base.\n\nBecause the triangles are similar, they share the same angles. This means that if we draw the heights in both triangles (from corresponding vertices to corresponding bases), these heights will also be proportional to the sides, but in the same ratio k.\n\nLet's say we choose BC and EF as our bases. Then:\n- The base ratio is BC/EF = k\n- The height ratio will also be h\u2081/h\u2082 = k (where h\u2081 and h\u2082 are the heights of triangles ABC and DEF respectively)\n\nNow, for the areas:\n- S\u2081 = (BC \u00d7 h\u2081)/2 for triangle ABC\n- S\u2082 = (EF \u00d7 h\u2082)/2 for triangle DEF\n\nWhen we take the ratio S\u2081/S\u2082, we get:\nS\u2081/S\u2082 = (BC \u00d7 h\u2081)/(EF \u00d7 h\u2082)\n\nSince both BC/EF = k and h\u2081/h\u2082 = k, when we multiply these ratios together, we get k \u00d7 k = k\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, S\u2081/S\u2082 = k\u00b2, which is exactly what we wanted to prove. The ratio of the areas equals the square of the ratio of the corresponding sides.\n\nThis makes intuitive sense because area is a two-dimensional measure, so when we scale a figure in both dimensions by a factor of k, the area gets scaled by k\u00b2.\nPrevious attempt failed with: \nPlease revise the proof.",

If we can find such a function f, then we can use the Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals to evaluate the integral by just looking at the endpoints.\n\nFirst, let's find the potential function f. Looking at F = \u27e8y, -x, z\u27e9, we can see that:\n- \u2202f/\u2202x = y (first component)\n- \u2202f/\u2202y = -x (second component)\n- \u2202f/\u2202z = z (third component)\n\nIntegrating these, we can determine that f(x,y,z) = xy - (x\u00b2+y\u00b2)/2 + z\u00b2/2 works as our potential function.\n\nNow that we have f, we can apply the Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals, which states that:\n\u222bC F \u2022 dr = f(r(b)) - f(r(a))\n\nFor our curve, we're going from t=0 to t=2\u03c0.

I'll explain it using the unit circle approach, as this provides the most intuitive understanding.\n\nImagine a point P on a circle with radius 1 centered at the origin. When we specify any angle x, this point's coordinates can be written as (cos x, sin x). This is because:\n- The x-coordinate of this point is cos x\n- The y-coordinate of this point is sin x\n\nNow, since this point lies on a circle with radius 1, it must satisfy the equation of a circle: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = r\u00b2, where r = 1.\n\nSubstituting the coordinates (cos x, sin x) into the circle equation:\n- (cos x)\u00b2 + (sin x)\u00b2 = 1\u00b2\n- cos\u00b2x + sin\u00b2x = 1\n\nThis relationship must hold true for any angle x because:\n1. The point P always stays on the unit circle as x changes\n2. The radius of the circle is always 1\n3. The coordinates (cos x, sin x) always represent a point on this circle\n\nTherefore, sin\u00b2x + cos\u00b2x = 1 must be true for all real numbers x, as it's simply expressing the fact that any point (cos x, sin x) lies on the unit circle.\n\nThis geometric understanding shows why the equation is not just a coincidence but a fundamental property of these trigonometric functions, rooted in the very way sine and cosine are defined in relation to the unit circle.\nPrevious attempt failed with: function expected at\n  sin\nterm has type\n  ?m.13\nfunction expected at\n  cos\nterm has type\n  ?m.44\nThe rfl tactic failed.

First, recall that the gradient of f at point a is the unique vector that, when dotted with any direction vector d, gives the directional derivative of f in direction d.\n\n2. In this problem, we're given that the directional derivatives in the direction of each basis vector vi equals the corresponding component wi of vector w.

Now, since B = {v1, v2, ..., vn} is a basis for V, any vector in V (including the gradient) can be uniquely expressed as a linear combination of these basis vectors.\n\n4. The key property of the gradient is that for any basis vector vi, the dot product of the gradient with vi must equal the directional derivative in direction vi. We know this equals wi.\n\n5.

We have a population proportion of 0.7 (70%), and we're taking samples of size 100. We want to find the probability that our sample proportion is less than 0.5 (50%). \n\nThe key insight is that for large sample sizes, the sampling distribution of proportions follows a normal distribution. The parameters of this normal distribution are:\n- Mean (\u03bc) = p = 0.7 (the population proportion)\n- Standard deviation (\u03c3) = sqrt(p(1-p)/n) = sqrt(0.7 * 0.3 / 100)\n\nTo find the probability, we need to:\n1. Calculate the standard deviation\n2. Find the z-score for x = 0.5\n3. Use the standard normal distribution to find the probability\n\nFor the standard deviation:\n\u03c3 = sqrt(0.7 * 0.3 / 100) = sqrt(0.21/100) = sqrt(0.0021) \u2248 0.0458\n\nThe z-score represents how many standard deviations x is from the mean:\nz = (x - \u03bc)/\u03c3\nz = (0.5 - 0.7)/0.0458 \u2248 -4.37\n\nThis negative z-score tells us that 0.5 is 4.37 standard deviations below the mean of 0.7.\n\nSince we're looking for P(X < 0.5), and we've converted this to a standard normal distribution, we're finding P(Z < -4.37). This is a very low probability because -4.37 is quite far below the mean in terms of standard deviations.\n\nUsing a standard normal table or calculator, we would find that P(Z < -4.37) is an extremely small number (approximately 0.0000062), meaning there is only about a 0.00062% chance that a sample proportion would be less than 0.5 when the true population proportion is 0.7 with a sample size of 100.\n\nThis makes intuitive sense because with a large sample size of 100, it would be very unusual for a sample proportion to deviate so far from the true population proportion of 0.7.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\nunknown constant 'Real.erf'\ncompiler IR check failed at 'standard_normal_cdf', error: unknown declaration 'Real.decidableLT'\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'z_score', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'probability_less_than_x', and it does not have executable code\nPlease revise the proof.",

We can do this by performing the same operation to both sides of the equation to maintain equality, similar to how the example with x + 3 = 5 was solved.\n\nFirst, we need to get rid of the +5 term. We can do this by adding -5 to both sides of the equation. This is valid because adding the same value to both sides maintains the equality. When we add -5 to +5, they will cancel out to 0 (by the definition of additive inverse).\n\nAfter this step, we'll have 2x = 10. Now we need to isolate x. Since x is multiplied by 2, we can multiply both sides by 1/2 (or divide by 2) to isolate x. This works because multiplication by 1/2 is the inverse operation of multiplication by 2.\n\nWhen we multiply 2x by 1/2, the 2 and 1/2 cancel out (multiply to 1), leaving just x. On the right side, 10 multiplied by 1/2 gives us 5.\n\nTherefore, x = 5 is our solution. We can verify this by plugging 5 back into the original equation: 2(5) + 5 = 15.\n\nThis solution follows the same principles we see in the context examples - particularly the idea of performing the same operation to both sides and using inverse operations to isolate the variable we want to solve for.",

We can express this using the definition of the derivative and then manipulate the integral representation of F(x).\n\nHere's the reasoning flow:\n\n1. First, we look at how F(x) changes when we go from x to x + \u0394x. The difference F(x + \u0394x) - F(x) represents the integral of f(t) from x to x + \u0394x, because the parts of the integral from a to x cancel out.\n\n2. To find F'(x), we need to divide this difference by \u0394x and take the limit as \u0394x approaches 0:\n   F'(x) = lim[\u0394x\u21920] (F(x + \u0394x) - F(x))/\u0394x\n   = lim[\u0394x\u21920] (1/\u0394x)\u222b[from x to x+\u0394x] f(t)dt\n\n3.

This tells us that there must be some point k between x and x+\u0394x where:\n   \u222b[from x to x+\u0394x] f(t)dt = f(k)\u0394x\n\n4.

Since f is continuous, f(k) approaches f(x).\n\n6. Therefore, F'(x) = f(x)\n\nThe proof works similarly for negative \u0394x, just considering the interval from x+\u0394x to x instead.\n\nThis proof shows that the derivative of an integral (with respect to its upper limit) gives back the original function - the fundamental connection between integration and differentiation that makes calculus work.",

First, we need to find the antiderivative (primitive) of f(x) = 2x. Looking at the context, we can use the Primitive of Power theorem, which states that the integral of x^n is (x^(n+1))/(n+1) + C.\n\n2. In our case, f(x) = 2x can be rewritten as 2x^1, so n = 1. The coefficient 2 can be pulled out front of the integral.\n\n3. Applying the power rule: the antiderivative of 2x is 2(x^2/2) = x^2 + C\n\n4. To evaluate the definite integral from 0 to 1, we need to:\n   - Evaluate the antiderivative at the upper bound (x = 1)\n   - Subtract the antiderivative evaluated at the lower bound (x = 0)\n   - This is sometimes called \"evaluating the difference of the endpoints\"\n\n5. When we plug in x = 1, we get (1)^2 = 1\n   When we plug in x = 0, we get (0)^2 = 0\n\n6.

We have a cylinder of radius r and height h, and inside it is a cone whose base perfectly matches the cylinder's base (so it also has radius r), and whose apex touches the center of the cylinder's top face.\n\nThe key insight is that this creates a right triangle if we look at it from the side. This triangle is formed by:\n- The height of the cone (which is h)\n- Half of the base diameter (which is r)\n- The slant height of the cone (let's call this L)\n\nThis right triangle is crucial because the angle we're looking for (let's call it \u03b8) is the angle at the apex of the cone, and in our right triangle, \u03b8/2 is the angle between the height and the slant height.\n\nWe can find this angle using basic trigonometry. In our right triangle:\n- The opposite side is r (the radius)\n- The adjacent side is h (the height)\n- The angle we want is twice the angle in this right triangle\n\nUsing the tangent function, we know that tan(\u03b8/2) = r/h. Therefore, the full angle at the apex (\u03b8) would be twice the arctangent of r/h.\n\nSo the angle at the apex of the cone is:\n\u03b8 = 2 * arctan(r/h)\n\nThis makes intuitive sense because:\n- If h is very large compared to r, the angle will be small (cone is very pointy)\n- If r is very large compared to h, the angle will be large (cone is very wide)\n- The angle will always be less than 180\u00b0 since we're dealing with a real cone\n\nThis solution relies only on basic geometric principles and trigonometry, and gives us the exact angle at the apex in terms of r and h as requested.",

Here's the intuitive reasoning:\n\nFirst, let's understand what we're working with. The Wronskian W(y1, y2) measures how \"independent\" two solutions are from each other. It's calculated as y1(x)y2'(x) - y2(x)y1'(x).\n\nThe key insight is to look at how this Wronskian changes as x varies. When we differentiate the Wronskian, something remarkable happens:\n\n1. When we differentiate W(y1, y2), we get terms involving both first and second derivatives of y1 and y2.\n\n2. Since both y1 and y2 are solutions to the original differential equation, we can use the fact that y'' = -p(x)y' - q(x)y for each solution. This lets us simplify the derivative of the Wronskian.\n\n3. After substituting and simplifying, we find that the derivative of the Wronskian satisfies a simple first-order differential equation: W' = -p(x)W\n\n4. This is where the magic happens. This simple equation tells us that the Wronskian must be of the form:\n   W(x) = C\u22c5e^(-\u222bp(x)dx), where C is some constant\n\n5. Now, the exponential function is never zero. Therefore:\n   - If C = 0, then W(x) is zero everywhere\n   - If C \u2260 0, then W(x) is never zero\n\nThis means the Wronskian can't switch between being zero and non-zero - it must be one or the other throughout the entire interval.\n\nThe physical interpretation is that if two solutions are linearly dependent at any point (Wronskian = 0), they must be linearly dependent everywhere.

We have a power series f(x) = \u2211a_n * x^n that converges absolutely within (-R, R). We want to show that we can differentiate it term by term to get f'(x) = \u2211n*a_n * x^(n-1).\n\nThe proof strategy will use the theorem about derivatives of uniformly convergent series of continuously differentiable functions. Here's how we can break this down:\n\n1. First, let's consider why each term in our series is continuously differentiable:\n   - Each term f_n(x) = a_n * x^n is a polynomial\n   - Polynomials are continuously differentiable everywhere\n   - The derivative of a_n * x^n is n*a_n * x^(n-1)\n\n2. We know the original series converges absolutely for all x in (-R, R). This means:\n   - The series \u2211|a_n * x^n| converges for any fixed x in (-R, R)\n   - This gives us pointwise convergence of the original series\n\n3. The key step is showing that the series of derivatives converges uniformly on any closed interval [a,b] contained within (-R, R). We can show this by:\n   - Taking any such interval [a,b]\n   - Noting that there exists a number r such that |x| \u2264 r < R for all x in [a,b]\n   - Using the ratio test to show that \u2211n*a_n * x^(n-1) converges uniformly on [a,b]\n\n4. Once we have uniform convergence of the series of derivatives, we can apply the theorem about derivatives of uniformly convergent series to conclude:\n   - The derivative of the sum equals the sum of the derivatives\n   - Therefore, f'(x) = \u2211n*a_n * x^(n-1)\n\nThe crucial insight is that absolute convergence of the original series within (-R, R) gives us enough control over the terms to ensure uniform convergence of the series of derivatives on any smaller interval, which is what we need to justify term-by-term differentiation.\n\nThis result is particularly powerful because it tells us that power series are not just continuous, but can be differentiated term by term, making them very useful in analysis and applications.",

Each specific value of t generates a specific point on the line. Therefore, if a point lies on the line, there must be some value of t that generates exactly that point.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n1. We know that (p, q) lies on the line\n2. The line consists of all points (x, y) that can be generated by plugging any real number t into the parametric equations\n3. When we plug in any value of t:\n   - The x-coordinate is determined by at + b\n   - The y-coordinate is determined by ct + d\n4. Since (p, q) is on the line, there must be some specific value of t that makes:\n   - p = at + b (for the x-coordinate)\n   - q = ct + d (for the y-coordinate)\n\nWe can think about this geometrically: as t varies, the point (at + b, ct + d) traces out the entire line. Since (p, q) is on this line, the moving point must \"pass through\" (p, q) at some moment - that is, for some value of t.\n\nThis is similar to how we proved in the context that any point on a line can be expressed using a parameter t in terms of two other points.

Here's the reasoning:\n\nFirst, we need to find how the function changes when we move a small distance h from the point a. At the point (a + h), the function value is (a + h)^2, while at point a, it's a^2.\n\nWhen we plug these into the difference quotient formula, we're looking at how the function's change (the numerator) compares to the small step h (the denominator) as h gets infinitely close to zero.\n\nIf we expand (a + h)^2 in the numerator, we get a^2 + 2ah + h^2. When we subtract a^2, we're left with 2ah + h^2 in the numerator. \n\nThe beautiful thing is that we can factor out h from both terms in the numerator, which cancels with the h in the denominator. This leaves us with (2a + h).\n\nAs h approaches zero, the h term vanishes, leaving us with exactly 2a.\n\nThis shows that at any point a, the instantaneous rate of change of x^2 is exactly twice the value of a, which makes intuitive sense because the function x^2 gets steeper as you move away from zero, and at any point, that steepness is captured by 2a.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. First, since F(x) is an antiderivative of f(x), we know that F'(x) = f(x) for all x in [a,b]. This means F(x) and f(x) have that special relationship where F(x) accumulates the area under f(x).\n\n2. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus tells us that when we have a continuous function f(x) on [a,b] and any antiderivative F(x), the definite integral from a to b of f(x) dx equals F(b) - F(a).\n\n3. In this case, we're specifically given that F(a) = 0. So when we apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:\n\n   \u222b[from a to b] f(x) dx = F(b) - F(a)\n                           = F(b) - 0\n                           = F(b)\n\n4. This makes intuitive sense because:\n   - F(x) accumulates the area under f(x) starting from x = a\n   - We're told F(a) = 0, so we start with no accumulated area\n   - As we move from a to b, F(x) tracks the total accumulated area\n   - When we reach b, F(b) represents the total area accumulated\n   - This total area is exactly what the definite integral calculates\n\nTherefore, under the given conditions where F(x) is an antiderivative of f(x) and F(a) = 0, the definite integral from a to b of f(x) dx must equal F(b) - F(a), which simplifies to just F(b) since F(a) = 0.\n\nThis proof relies on the fundamental connection between derivatives and integrals, showing how they are inverse operations of each other, with the definite integral representing the total accumulated change in the antiderivative over an interval.\nPrevious attempt failed with: type mismatch\n  ContinuousAt.continuousWithinAt (HasDerivAt.continuousAt (hF x))\nhas type\n  ContinuousWithinAt F ?m.1453 x : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  ContinuousWithinAt f (Set.Icc a b) x : Prop\nunknown identifier 'integral_eq_sub_of_hasDerivAt'\nPlease revise the proof.",

The original line y = mx + b has slope m, because m is the coefficient of x. This slope determines how steeply the line rises or falls as x increases.\n\n2. In the new equation y = mx + m + b, we can see that:\n   - The coefficient of x is still m, so this line has the same slope as the original\n   - The only difference is that instead of just b as the y-intercept, we now have (m + b)\n\n3. When two lines have the same slope but different y-intercepts, they are parallel by definition. This is because:\n   - They rise or fall at exactly the same rate (given by m)\n   - They never intersect because they're just shifted versions of each other\n   - The shift in this case is exactly m units up from the original line\n\n4. We can verify this by picking any x value - the vertical distance between the two lines will always be m units, which confirms they are parallel.\n\nTherefore, replacing x with (x + 1) in the original equation creates a new line that is parallel to the original line, shifted up by m units while maintaining the same slope.\n\nThis proof aligns with the context provided, particularly with the fundamental concept that lines are parallel if and only if they have the same slope but different y-intercepts, which is exactly what we've shown here.\nPrevious attempt failed with: type mismatch\n  m * x + m + b\nhas type\n  \u211d : outParam Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u211d \u2192 \u211d \u2192 \u211d \u2192 \u211d : Type\nPlease revise the proof.",

It means we multiply x by itself y times.\n   For example, if x^y = x * x * ... * x (y times)\n\n2) Then, when we raise this result to the power of z, we're taking (x^y) and multiplying it by itself z times.\n   So (x^y)^z = (x^y) * (x^y) * ... * (x^y) (z times)\n\n3) If we expand this out, we get:\n   (x * x * ... * x [y times]) * (x * x * ... * x [y times]) * ...

Here's how:\n\nWhen we say a function f is continuous at point c, this means that for any small positive number epsilon (no matter how tiny), we can find a positive number delta such that whenever x is within delta units of c, f(x) must be within epsilon units of f(c).\n\nThis is exactly what we need to prove that the limit exists and equals f(c)! Here's why:\n\nTo show a limit exists and equals some value L, we need to demonstrate that we can make f(x) as close as we want to L by taking x sufficiently close to c. In this case, L would be f(c).\n\nSince we know f is continuous at c, we already have this property: For any epsilon > 0, there exists a delta > 0 such that when |x - c| < delta, |f(x) - f(c)| < epsilon.\n\nThis is precisely the definition of a limit! It tells us that as x gets arbitrarily close to c (within delta), f(x) gets arbitrarily close to f(c) (within epsilon). Therefore, the limit as x approaches c must equal f(c).\n\nThe continuity of f at c guarantees that there are no \"jumps\" or \"gaps\" in the function at c, which means the value f(c) must be exactly where the limit leads us. If the limit existed but was different from f(c), this would create a jump discontinuity, contradicting our assumption that f is continuous at c.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that if f is continuous at c, then the limit as x approaches c of f(x) must equal f(c).\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  TopologicalSpace \u03b1\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  TopologicalSpace \u03b1\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nunknown identifier 'tendsto_nhds_left'\nPlease revise the proof.",

In our place-value system, this means each digit shifts one position to the left, and a zero fills the rightmost position. From the decimal point's perspective, this appears as the decimal point moving one place to the right.\n\n2. When we multiply by 10^2 (=100), we're effectively multiplying by 10 twice. This shifts all digits two positions to the left, or equivalently, moves the decimal point two places to the right.\n\n3. By extension, when we multiply by 10^n, we're multiplying by 10 exactly n times. Each multiplication by 10 shifts the decimal point one position to the right, so n multiplications shift it n positions.\n\nFor example:\n- 3.14 \u00d7 10^1 = 31.4\n- 3.14 \u00d7 10^2 = 314\n- 3.14 \u00d7 10^3 = 3,140\n\nThis works because in our decimal system, each position represents a power of 10. Moving right from the decimal point, we have the ones place (10^0), tens place (10^1), hundreds place (10^2), and so on. Moving left from the decimal point, we have tenths (10^-1), hundredths (10^-2), and so on.\n\nTherefore, multiplying by 10^n systematically shifts each digit n places to the left, which is equivalent to moving the decimal point n places to the right.",

        "informal_proof": "# Informal Proof:\n\nLet me explain how we can determine the slope of this sequence and its implications through clear reasoning.\n\nFirst, let's understand what we're working with. We have a sequence where each term is given by a_n = n^2 - 2n + 3. However, we're asked to interpret this as a linear model y = \u03b20 + \u03b21*n, which means we need to understand how this sequence behaves in terms of linear growth.\n\nThe key insight is that a_n = n^2 - 2n + 3 is actually a quadratic function, not a linear one. To understand its linear trend, we need to look at how it changes between consecutive terms.\n\nLet's examine how the sequence grows:\n1. When n = 1: a_1 = 1 - 2 + 3 = 2\n2. When n = 2: a_2 = 4 - 4 + 3 = 3\n3. When n = 3: a_3 = 9 - 6 + 3 = 6\n4. When n = 4: a_4 = 16 - 8 + 3 = 11\n\nLooking at the differences between consecutive terms:\n- From a_1 to a_2: increase of 1\n- From a_2 to a_3: increase of 3\n- From a_3 to a_4: increase of 5\n\nWe can see that the differences between consecutive terms are increasing by 2 each time. This means the sequence is not just increasing, but increasing at an increasing rate (accelerating growth).\n\nSince we're asked about the slope in a linear model interpretation, we need to consider the average rate of change over the sequence. Because n^2 is the dominant term as n grows larger (it grows faster than -2n and the constant term 3), the sequence will ultimately show a positive trend with an increasing slope.\n\nTherefore, when interpreted as a linear model, the slope \u03b21 would be positive, indicating an overall upward trend in the sequence. This implies that the sequence is strictly increasing for sufficiently large n and will diverge to positive infinity.\n\nThis conclusion is supported by the Axiom of Archimedes (from the context), which tells us that for any real number, there exists a natural number greater than it. In this case, because of the quadratic growth, the sequence will eventually exceed any given real number.\nPrevious attempt failed with: invalid constructor \u27e8...\u27e9, insufficient number of arguments, constructs 'Eq.refl' does not have explicit fields, but #2 provided\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "# Informal Proof:\n\nLet me explain why a function being differentiable at a point implies it has partial derivatives at that point. Here's the intuitive reasoning:\n\n1) First, let's understand what differentiability means in two dimensions. If f is differentiable at (x\u2080, y\u2080), then f can be approximated near (x\u2080, y\u2080) by a linear function, with the approximation error becoming negligible compared to the distance from (x\u2080, y\u2080).\n\n2) The partial derivatives represent the rates of change of f when we move only in the x or y direction. They are special cases of the general directional changes that differentiability guarantees exist.\n\n3) To find the partial derivative with respect to x at (x\u2080, y\u2080), we only need to consider what happens when we move slightly in the x-direction while keeping y fixed at y\u2080. This is like restricting our attention to a slice of the function along the x-axis through (x\u2080, y\u2080).\n\n4) Since f is differentiable at (x\u2080, y\u2080), it has a linear approximation in all directions, including specifically along the x and y axes. This means that when we move slightly in the x-direction:\n   - The change in f can be approximated by a linear function\n   - The approximation error becomes negligible compared to the change in x\n   - Therefore, the limit defining the partial derivative with respect to x must exist\n\n5) The same argument applies for the partial derivative with respect to y, where we keep x fixed at x\u2080 and vary y slightly around y\u2080.\n\n6) Therefore, both partial derivatives must exist at (x\u2080, y\u2080) because they are just special cases of the general differentiability property, looking at changes along the coordinate axes rather than in arbitrary directions.\n\nThe key insight is that differentiability is a stronger condition than having partial derivatives - it requires the function to be well-behaved in all directions, not just along the coordinate axes. So if we have differentiability, we automatically get the existence of partial derivatives as a consequence.\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  HasFDerivAt f fun p => (p.1, p.2)\nargument\n  fun p => (p.1, p.2)\nhas type\n  \u211d \u00d7 \u211d \u2192 \u211d \u00d7 \u211d : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u211d \u00d7 \u211d \u2192L[?m.523] \u211d : Type\napplication type mismatch\n  HasFDerivAt f fun p => (p.1, p.2)\nargument\n  fun p => (p.1, p.2)\nhas type\n  \u211d \u00d7 \u211d \u2192 \u211d \u00d7 \u211d : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u211d \u00d7 \u211d \u2192L[?m.4070] \u211d : Type\nunsolved goals\nf : \u211d \u00d7 \u211d \u2192 \u211d\nx\u2080 y\u2080 : \u211d\nhf : DifferentiableAt \u211d f (x\u2080, y\u2080)\n\u22a2 HasFDerivAt f (sorryAx (\u211d \u00d7 \u211d \u2192L[?m.523] \u211d) true) (x\u2080, y\u2080)\nPlease revise the proof.",

This is one of the most basic and important properties of triangles.\n\nIn this problem, we're given two angles:\n- \u2220A = 40\u00b0\n- \u2220B = 70\u00b0\n\nTo find \u2220C, we can subtract the sum of the known angles from 180\u00b0. This works because:\n- If we call the three angles a, b, and c\n- Then a + b + c = 180\u00b0\n- And if we know a and b, we can solve for c using c = 180\u00b0 - (a + b)\n\nSo in this case:\n1. We add the known angles: 40\u00b0 + 70\u00b0 = 110\u00b0\n2. Then subtract from 180\u00b0: 180\u00b0 - 110\u00b0 = 70\u00b0\n\nTherefore, \u2220C must equal 70\u00b0\n\nWe can verify this is correct because:\n- All three angles (40\u00b0, 70\u00b0, and 70\u00b0) sum to 180\u00b0\n- All angles are positive\n- The values are reasonable for a triangle (each is less than 180\u00b0)\n\nThis is the unique solution for \u2220C given the constraints of the problem.\nPrevious attempt failed with: expected token\nPlease revise the proof.",

First, we need to understand that since water maintains its volume when transferred between containers, the volume of the cylinder must equal the volume of the sphere.\n\n2. For the cylinder:\n   - We know the diameter is 4 cm, so the radius is 2 cm\n   - The height is 10 cm\n   - The volume of a cylinder is \u03c0r\u00b2h\n   - So the cylinder's volume is \u03c0(2)\u00b2(10) = 40\u03c0 cubic centimeters\n\n3.

We can set up the equation:\n   - 40\u03c0 = (4/3)\u03c0R\u00b3\n   - The \u03c0 cancels out on both sides\n   - 40 = (4/3)R\u00b3\n   - Multiply both sides by 3/4\n   - 30 = R\u00b3\n   - Take the cube root of both sides\n   - R = \u221b30 \u2248 3.107 cm\n\n5. Since the question asks for diameter, we multiply the radius by 2:\n   - Diameter = 2R = 2(\u221b30) \u2248 6.214 cm\n\nTherefore, the spherical container needs a diameter of approximately 6.214 centimeters to hold exactly the same volume of water as the cylindrical container.\n\nThe key insight is that water volume is conserved during transfer, allowing us to equate the volume formulas and solve for the unknown dimension.\nPrevious attempt failed with: ambiguous, possible interpretations \n  \u03c0 : \u2115 \u2192 \u2115\n  \n  \u03c0 : \u211d\nambiguous, possible interpretations \n  \u03c0 : \u2115 \u2192 \u2115\n  \n  \u03c0 : \u211d\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\nambiguous, possible interpretations \n  \u03c0 : \u2115 \u2192 \u2115\n  \n  \u03c0 : \u211d\nambiguous, possible interpretations \n  \u03c0 : \u2115 \u2192 \u2115\n  \n  \u03c0 : \u211d\nambiguous, possible interpretations \n  \u03c0 : \u2115 \u2192 \u2115\n  \n  \u03c0 : \u211d\nambiguous, possible interpretations \n  \u03c0 : \u2115 \u2192 \u2115\n  \n  \u03c0 : \u211d\nunsolved goals\nV_cylinder : \u211d := cylinderVolume 2 10\n\u22a2 sorryAx \u211d true * (2 * 2) * 10 = sorryAx \u211d true * 4 * 10\nunknown identifier 'd'\nambiguous, possible interpretations \n  \u03c0 : \u2115 \u2192 \u2115\n  \n  \u03c0 : \u211d\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  V_cylinder\nV_cylinder : \u211d := cylinderVolume 2 10\nh_V_cylinder : V_cylinder = 40 * sorryAx \u211d true\n\u22a2 sphereVolume (sorryAx \u211d true / 2) = 40 * sorryAx \u211d true\nambiguous, possible interpretations \n  \u03c0 : \u2115 \u2192 \u2115\n  \n  \u03c0 : \u211d\nunknown identifier 'd'\nambiguous, possible interpretations \n  \u03c0 : \u2115 \u2192 \u2115\n  \n  \u03c0 : \u211d\nunknown identifier 'd'\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  ?a * ?b / ?c\nV_cylinder : \u211d := cylinderVolume 2 10\nh_V_cylinder : V_cylinder = 40 * sorryAx \u211d true\nh_sphere_volume : sphereVolume (sorryAx \u211d true / 2) = 40 * sorryAx \u211d true\nh_R_cubed : 4 / 3 * sorryAx \u2115 true * (sorryAx \u2115 true / 2) ^ 3 = 40 * sorryAx \u2115 true\n\u22a2 (sorryAx \u2115 true / 2) ^ 3 * (4 / 3) = 40\nunknown identifier 'd'\nunknown identifier 'd'\nunsolved goals\nV_cylinder : \u211d := cylinderVolume 2 10\nh_V_cylinder : V_cylinder = 40 * sorryAx \u211d true\nh_sphere_volume : sphereVolume (sorryAx \u211d true / 2) = 40 * sorryAx \u211d true\nh_R_cubed : 4 / 3 * sorryAx \u2115 true * (sorryAx \u2115 true / 2) ^ 3 = 40 * sorryAx \u2115 true\nh_R_cubed' : 4 / 3 * (sorryAx \u2115 true / 2) ^ 3 = 40\n\u22a2 (sorryAx \u2115 true / 2) ^ 3 = 4 / 3 * (sorryAx \u2115 true / 2) ^ 3 * (3 / 4)\nunsolved goals\nV_cylinder : \u211d := cylinderVolume 2 10\nh_V_cylinder : V_cylinder = 40 * sorryAx \u211d true\nh_sphere_volume : sphereVolume (sorryAx \u211d true / 2) = 40 * sorryAx \u211d true\nh_R_cubed : 4 / 3 * sorryAx \u2115 true * (sorryAx \u2115 true / 2) ^ 3 = 40 * sorryAx \u2115 true\nh_R_cubed' : 4 / 3 * (sorryAx \u2115 true / 2) ^ 3 = 40\n\u22a2 False\nunknown identifier 'd'\nunknown identifier 'd'\nunknown identifier 'd'\nunsolved goals\nV_cylinder : \u211d := cylinderVolume 2 10\nh_V_cylinder : V_cylinder = 40 * sorryAx \u211d true\nh_sphere_volume : sphereVolume (sorryAx \u211d true / 2) = 40 * sorryAx \u211d true\nh_R_cubed : 4 / 3 * sorryAx \u2115 true * (sorryAx \u2115 true / 2) ^ 3 = 40 * sorryAx \u2115 true\nh_R_cubed' : 4 / 3 * (sorryAx \u2115 true / 2) ^ 3 = 40\nh_d_cubed : (sorryAx \u2115 true / 2) ^ 3 = 30\n\u22a2 sorryAx \u2115 true = sorryAx \u2115 true / 2 * 2\nunsolved goals\nV_cylinder : \u211d := cylinderVolume 2 10\nh_V_cylinder : V_cylinder = 40 * sorryAx \u211d true\nh_sphere_volume : sphereVolume (sorryAx \u211d true / 2) = 40 * sorryAx \u211d true\nh_R_cubed : 4 / 3 * sorryAx \u2115 true * (sorryAx \u2115 true / 2) ^ 3 = 40 * sorryAx \u2115 true\nh_R_cubed' : 4 / 3 * (sorryAx \u2115 true / 2) ^ 3 = 40\nh_d_cubed : (sorryAx \u2115 true / 2) ^ 3 = 30\n\u22a2 2 * (sorryAx \u2115 true / 2) = 2 * ((sorryAx \u2115 true / 2) ^ 3) ^ (1 / 3)\nPlease revise the proof.",

At any point t, r(t) is a vector from the origin to a point on the unit circle.\n\nHere's how we can prove the orthogonality:\n\n1. First, let's understand what r(t) and its derivative look like:\n   - r(t) = (cos(t), sin(t)) is our position vector\n   - The derivative r'(t) = (-sin(t), cos(t)) represents the velocity vector\n   \n2. For two vectors to be orthogonal, their dot product must be zero. So we need to show that r(t) \u00b7 r'(t) = 0.\n\n3. Let's compute the dot product:\n   - r(t) \u00b7 r'(t) = cos(t)(-sin(t)) + sin(t)(cos(t))\n   - This simplifies to: -cos(t)sin(t) + sin(t)cos(t) = 0\n\n4. The geometric interpretation is that at any point on the unit circle, the velocity vector r'(t) is tangent to the circle and therefore perpendicular to the radius vector r(t).\n\n5. This makes sense physically because when moving in a circle, the velocity vector is always perpendicular to the radius vector - it's what keeps the motion circular rather than moving away from or toward the center.\n\nThis orthogonality property is a fundamental characteristic of circular motion and relates directly to the derivatives of unit vectors in polar coordinates as shown in the context. The result follows from the fact that the derivative of a unit vector in the radial direction is perpendicular to the original vector.\nPrevious attempt failed with: compiler IR check failed at 'r', error: unknown declaration 'Real.cos'\ncompiler IR check failed at 'r'', error: unknown declaration 'Real.sin'\nThe rfl tactic failed.

When we substitute these expressions for each v\u1d62 into our expression for x, we get:\n   x = c\u2081(p\u2081\u2081w\u2081 + ... + p\u2081\u2099w\u2099) + c\u2082(p\u2082\u2081w\u2081 + ... + p\u2082\u2099w\u2099) + ... + c\u2099(p\u2099\u2081w\u2081 + ... + p\u2099\u2099w\u2099)\n\n5. When we collect terms with respect to each w\u1d62, we get:\n   x = (p\u2081\u2081c\u2081 + p\u2082\u2081c\u2082 + ... + p\u2099\u2081c\u2099)w\u2081 + ... + (p\u2081\u2099c\u2081 + p\u2082\u2099c\u2082 + ... + p\u2099\u2099c\u2099)w\u2099\n\n6. The coefficients of w\u1d62 in this expression form exactly the coordinates of x in basis C, and these coefficients are precisely what we get when we multiply P by [x]B.\n\n7. Therefore, [x]C = P[x]B, which is what we wanted to prove.\n\nThis relationship shows that P acts as a \"translator\" between the two coordinate systems, taking coordinates expressed in basis B and converting them to the corresponding coordinates in basis C.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown constant 'FiniteDimensional.Basis'\nunknown constant 'FiniteDimensional.Basis'\ninvalid field notation, function 'Matrix.toLin'' does not have argument with type (Matrix ...) that can be used, it must be explicit or implicit with a unique name\ninvalid field notation, type is not of the form (C ...) where C is a constant\n  LinearMap\nhas type\n  (?m.5509 \u2192+* ?m.5510) \u2192\n    (M : Type ?u.5507) \u2192\n      (M\u2082 : Type ?u.5508) \u2192\n        [inst : AddCommMonoid M] \u2192\n          [inst_1 : AddCommMonoid M\u2082] \u2192\n            [inst : Module ?m.5509 M] \u2192 [inst : Module ?m.5510 M\u2082] \u2192 Type (max ?u.5507 ?u.5508)\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, equality or iff proof expected\n  ?m.5748\nn : \u2115\nF : Type u_1\ninst\u271d\u00b2 : Field F\nV : Type u_2\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : AddCommGroup V\ninst\u271d : Module F V\nB : sorryAx (Sort ?u.3931) true\nC : sorryAx (Sort ?u.3935) true\nP : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) F\nx : V\n\u22a2 (sorryAx (V \u2192\u2097[F] V) true) x = sorryAx V true\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, equality or iff proof expected\n  ?m.7982\nn : \u2115\nF : Type u_1\ninst\u271d\u00b2 : Field F\nV : Type u_2\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : AddCommGroup V\ninst\u271d : Module F V\nB : sorryAx (Sort ?u.7450) true\nC : sorryAx (Sort ?u.7454) true\nP : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) F\nx : V\n\u22a2 sorryAx (Fin n \u2192 F) true = P.mulVec (sorryAx (Fin n \u2192 F) true)\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, equality or iff proof expected\n  ?m.9984\nn : \u2115\nF : Type u_1\ninst\u271d\u00b2 : Field F\nV : Type u_2\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : AddCommGroup V\ninst\u271d : Module F V\nB : sorryAx (Sort ?u.9452) true\nC : sorryAx (Sort ?u.9456) true\nP : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) F\nx : V\n\u22a2 sorryAx (Fin n \u2192 F) true = P.mulVec (sorryAx (Fin n \u2192 F) true)\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, equality or iff proof expected\n  ?m.11986\nn : \u2115\nF : Type u_1\ninst\u271d\u00b2 : Field F\nV : Type u_2\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : AddCommGroup V\ninst\u271d : Module F V\nB : sorryAx (Sort ?u.11454) true\nC : sorryAx (Sort ?u.11458) true\nP : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) F\nx : V\n\u22a2 sorryAx (Fin n \u2192 F) true = P.mulVec (sorryAx (Fin n \u2192 F) true)\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, equality or iff proof expected\n  ?m.13988\nn : \u2115\nF : Type u_1\ninst\u271d\u00b2 : Field F\nV : Type u_2\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : AddCommGroup V\ninst\u271d : Module F V\nB : sorryAx (Sort ?u.13456) true\nC : sorryAx (Sort ?u.13460) true\nP : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) F\nx : V\n\u22a2 sorryAx (Fin n \u2192 F) true = P.mulVec (sorryAx (Fin n \u2192 F) true)\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, equality or iff proof expected\n  ?m.15990\nn : \u2115\nF : Type u_1\ninst\u271d\u00b2 : Field F\nV : Type u_2\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : AddCommGroup V\ninst\u271d : Module F V\nB : sorryAx (Sort ?u.15458) true\nC : sorryAx (Sort ?u.15462) true\nP : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) F\nx : V\n\u22a2 sorryAx (Fin n \u2192 F) true = P.mulVec (sorryAx (Fin n \u2192 F) true)\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, equality or iff proof expected\n  ?m.17992\nn : \u2115\nF : Type u_1\ninst\u271d\u00b2 : Field F\nV : Type u_2\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : AddCommGroup V\ninst\u271d : Module F V\nB : sorryAx (Sort ?u.17460) true\nC : sorryAx (Sort ?u.17464) true\nP : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) F\nx : V\n\u22a2 sorryAx (Fin n \u2192 F) true = P.mulVec (sorryAx (Fin n \u2192 F) true)\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, equality or iff proof expected\n  ?m.19994\nn : \u2115\nF : Type u_1\ninst\u271d\u00b2 : Field F\nV : Type u_2\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : AddCommGroup V\ninst\u271d : Module F V\nB : sorryAx (Sort ?u.19462) true\nC : sorryAx (Sort ?u.19466) true\nP : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) F\nx : V\n\u22a2 sorryAx (Fin n \u2192 F) true = P.mulVec (sorryAx (Fin n \u2192 F) true)\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, equality or iff proof expected\n  ?m.21996\nn : \u2115\nF : Type u_1\ninst\u271d\u00b2 : Field F\nV : Type u_2\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : AddCommGroup V\ninst\u271d : Module F V\nB : sorryAx (Sort ?u.21464) true\nC : sorryAx (Sort ?u.21468) true\nP : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) F\nx : V\n\u22a2 sorryAx (Fin n \u2192 F) true = P.mulVec (sorryAx (Fin n \u2192 F) true)\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, equality or iff proof expected\n  ?m.23998\nn : \u2115\nF : Type u_1\ninst\u271d\u00b2 : Field F\nV : Type u_2\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : AddCommGroup V\ninst\u271d : Module F V\nB : sorryAx (Sort ?u.23466) true\nC : sorryAx (Sort ?u.23470) true\nP : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) F\nx : V\n\u22a2 sorryAx (Fin n \u2192 F) true = P.mulVec (sorryAx (Fin n \u2192 F) true)\nPlease revise the proof.",

Let me explain the reasoning step by step:\n\n1. First, let's understand what we know:\n   - The original cube is 5 cm on each side with a mass of 20 g\n   - A smaller cube of 2 cm on each side with mass 7 g is removed\n   - We need to find the mass of what remains\n\n2. The relationship between mass and volume must be proportional since it's the same material throughout. This means:\n   - If we know how much mass corresponds to a certain volume, we can find the remaining mass by subtracting the mass of the removed portion\n\n3. The original cube:\n   - Has a volume of 5\u00b3 = 125 cubic centimeters\n   - Has a mass of 20 grams\n   - Therefore each cubic centimeter has a mass of 20/125 grams\n\n4. The removed cube:\n   - Has a volume of 2\u00b3 = 8 cubic centimeters\n   - Has a mass of 7 grams\n   - This confirms our proportional relationship\n\n5. Therefore:\n   - The remaining mass will be 20 - 7 = 13 grams\n\nThe answer is 13 grams. This makes sense because:\n- The mass removed (7g) plus the mass remaining (13g) equals the original mass (20g)\n- The proportions are consistent with the volumes involved\n\nThis proof relies on the basic principle that when working with a uniform material, mass is directly proportional to volume, and that mass is conserved when a portion is removed.\nPrevious attempt failed with: type of theorem 'remainingCubeMass' is not a proposition\n  \u211d\nunknown identifier 'remainingCubeMass'\nPlease revise the proof.",

We know from the fundamental theorem about rectangle areas that the area of R is simply the product of its length and width, so the initial area is l \u00d7 w.\n\nNow, when we perform the transformation to get R', we:\n- Increase the length by a units, making the new length (l + a)\n- Decrease the width by a units, making the new width (w - a)\n\nTo find the area of R', we multiply its new length and width:\nArea of R' = (l + a)(w - a)\n\nIf we expand this algebraically, we get:\n(l + a)(w - a) = lw - la + aw - a\u00b2\n                = lw + (aw - la) - a\u00b2\n                = lw + a(w - l) - a\u00b2\n\nThe key insight is that when we distribute the terms, the middle terms aw and -la have opposite signs and the extra term -a\u00b2 appears. However, when we look at the original area lw, we can see that the additional terms must cancel out for the areas to be equal.\n\nIndeed, if we continue the algebra:\nlw + a(w - l) - a\u00b2 = lw\n\nThis equality holds true because the terms a(w - l) and -a\u00b2 sum to zero, leaving us with just lw, which is the original area.\n\nThis makes sense geometrically as well - when we increase one dimension and decrease the other by the same amount, we're essentially \"redistributing\" the area rather than changing it. The extra area gained from lengthening is exactly compensated by the area lost from narrowing.\n\nTherefore, the area of the transformed rectangle R' equals the area of the original rectangle R, which is what we wanted to prove.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unsolved goals\nl w a : \u211d\n\u22a2 -(l * a) + l * w + (a * w - a ^ 2) = l * w\nPlease revise the proof.",

The proof shows that there exists a unique matrix A that converts coordinates from one basis to another.\n\nFirst, let's understand what we're trying to prove:\n- We have two different bases B1 and B2 for the same vector space V\n- Any vector v can be written in terms of either basis\n- We want to show there's a unique matrix A that converts coordinates from B2 to B1\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. Since B2 is a basis, we can express each vector from B1 in terms of B2. Let's start by writing each vi (from B1) as a linear combination of the wj vectors (from B2). These expressions will give us the columns of our matrix A.\n\n2. For each vi in B1, we can write:\n   vi = ai1w1 + ai2w2 + ... + ainwn\n   The coefficients aij will form the entries of our matrix A.\n\n3. To show existence:\n   - When we express any vector v in terms of B2 coordinates and multiply by A, we get the B1 coordinates\n   - This works because A was constructed specifically to transform between these bases\n   - The matrix A exists because we can always find these coefficients (since B2 is a basis)\n\n4. To show uniqueness:\n   - Suppose there were two different matrices A and A' that both worked\n   - Then for any vector v, we'd have A[v]B2 = [v]B1 = A'[v]B2\n   - This means (A-A')[v]B2 = 0 for all vectors v\n   - Since B2 is a basis, this can only happen if A = A'\n\n5. The key insight is that the matrix A is actually the change of basis matrix, and its columns are precisely the coordinates of the first basis vectors expressed in terms of the second basis.\n\nTherefore, we've shown both existence (by construction) and uniqueness (by contradiction) of the matrix A that converts coordinates from B2 to B1.\nPrevious attempt failed with: function expected at\n  IsBasis\nterm has type\n  x\u271d\nunknown constant 'Matrix.mulVec_toMatrix'\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, equality or iff proof expected\n  ?m.9283\ncase h.left\nn\u271d : \u2115\nIsBasis\u271d : ?m.7299\nF\u271d : Type u_1\ninst\u271d\u2075 : Field F\u271d\nV\u271d : Type u_2\ninst\u271d\u2074 : AddCommGroup V\u271d\ninst\u271d\u00b3 : Module F\u271d V\u271d\nB1\u271d B2\u271d : Fin n\u271d \u2192 V\u271d\nhB1\u271d : sorryAx (Sort ?u.7954) true\nhB2\u271d : sorryAx (Sort ?u.7957) true\nn : \u2115\nx\u271d : Sort ?u.7298\nIsBasis : x\u271d\nF : Type u_1\ninst\u271d\u00b2 : Field F\nV : Type u_2\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : AddCommGroup V\ninst\u271d : Module F V\nB1 B2 : Fin n \u2192 V\nhB1 : sorryAx (Sort ?u.7954) true\nhB2 : sorryAx (Sort ?u.7957) true\nv : V\n\u22a2 sorryAx (Fin n \u2192 F) true = (sorryAx (Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) F) true).mulVec (sorryAx (Fin n \u2192 F) true)\nunknown constant 'Matrix.toMatrix_apply'\nPlease revise the proof.",

Here's how we can think about it:\n\nFirst, we start with a rectangle ABCD where AB = a and BC = b. The diagonal AC divides this rectangle into two equal triangles (ABC and ADC). This is a fundamental property of rectangles that we know is true.\n\nNow, the interesting part is what happens when we transform AC into AE where AE = AB + BC. This means we're essentially \"extending\" the diagonal AC to a new point E such that AE equals the sum of the rectangle's width and height.\n\nThe crucial observation is that when we do this transformation, triangle ABE forms a specific relationship with the original rectangle. Because AE = AB + BC, point E must lie in a position that creates a special geometric relationship.\n\nIf we look at the areas involved:\n- The original rectangle ABCD has area a \u00d7 b\n- Triangle ABE shares the same base AB with the rectangle\n- The height of triangle ABE relative to base AB must be equal to BC (or b)\n\nThis is because the length AE being equal to AB + BC creates a specific geometric configuration where the height of triangle ABE to base AB equals the height of the rectangle.\n\nWhen we calculate the area of triangle ABE using the base-height formula (\u00bd \u00d7 base \u00d7 height), we get:\n\u00bd \u00d7 AB \u00d7 BC = \u00bd \u00d7 a \u00d7 b\n\nThis is exactly half the area of the rectangle ABCD (which is a \u00d7 b).\n\nThe relationship between the areas follows naturally from the geometric construction and the given condition about AE's length, similar to how parallelograms relate to triangles on the same base and between the same parallels, as shown in the context theorem.\n\nTherefore, the area of triangle ABE must be exactly half the area of rectangle ABCD.",

First, we know that matrix A transforms vector v to vector w. This is a well-defined transformation since A is a 2x2 matrix operating on a vector in R^2.\n\n2. The fact that det(A) \u2260 0 tells us something crucial: A is invertible. This means that the transformation preserves linear independence and doesn't map different vectors to the same point.\n\n3. When det(A) \u2260 0, we can construct the inverse matrix A^(-1) using the formula:\n   A^(-1) = (1/det(A)) * adj(A)\n   where adj(A) is the adjugate matrix of A (the transpose of its cofactor matrix)\n\n4. This inverse matrix A^(-1) is exactly the matrix B we're looking for. When we apply B to w, it will give us back v because:\n   - B(w) = A^(-1)(Av) = (A^(-1)A)v = Iv = v\n   where I is the identity matrix\n\n5. The transformation works in polar coordinates just as it does in Cartesian coordinates because the underlying linear algebra principles remain the same - the non-zero determinant ensures the transformation is bijective (one-to-one and onto).\n\nTherefore, as long as det(A) \u2260 0, we can always find a matrix B (specifically, B = A^(-1)) that will transform w back to v. This B exists and is unique because the non-zero determinant guarantees that A is invertible.\n\nThe proof relies on the fundamental connection between non-zero determinants and invertible transformations, which is a cornerstone of linear algebra. The fact that we're working in polar coordinates doesn't change these basic properties - it just affects how we might visualize the transformation.\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  A.mulVec v\nargument\n  v\nhas type\n  Vector \u211d 2 : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  Fin 2 \u2192 \u211d : Type\nfunction expected at\n  det\nterm has type\n  x\u271d\nunknown identifier 'adjugate'\nPlease revise the proof.",

We have a null hypothesis (H\u2080) that the new teaching method has no effect (meaning the true population mean is still 80), and an alternative hypothesis (H\u2081) that the method has a positive effect (meaning the true population mean is greater than 80).\n\nThe key insight is that if the null hypothesis is true, then any difference we observe between our sample mean (85) and the population mean (80) should just be due to random chance. Under the null hypothesis, the sampling distribution of means follows a normal distribution, thanks to the Central Limit Theorem, since we have a reasonably large sample size (n=30).\n\nFor a sample of size 30, the standard error of the mean would be the population standard deviation (10) divided by the square root of the sample size (\u221a30). This gives us the standard error: 10/\u221a30 \u2248 1.83.\n\nNow, we can calculate how many standard errors away our observed mean (85) is from the hypothesized mean (80). This is our test statistic:\n(85 - 80)/1.83 \u2248 2.73 standard deviations.\n\nFor a one-sided test at the 0.05 significance level, we would reject the null hypothesis if our test statistic exceeds 1.645 (the critical value for a one-tailed test at \u03b1 = 0.05). Since 2.73 > 1.645, we can reject the null hypothesis.\n\nThe intuitive explanation is that if the teaching method truly had no effect, the probability of seeing a mean score this high or higher just by chance is less than 5%. Therefore, we have sufficient evidence to conclude that the new teaching method likely has a positive effect on test scores.\n\nThis conclusion is supported by both the mathematical calculations and the logical reasoning that if the difference was due to chance alone, we would rarely see such a large deviation from the hypothesized mean under normal circumstances.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\napplication type mismatch\n  sqrt_ne_zero'.mpr ?m.4646\nargument\n  ?m.4646\nhas type\n  30 \u2260 0 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  0 < ?m.4612 : Prop\nunsolved goals\nh_testStatistic : testStatistic = (85 - 80) / (10 / \u221a30)\nh_simplified : (85 - 80) / (10 / \u221a30) = 5 * \u221a30 / 10\n\u22a2 5 * \u221a30 * 2 = \u221a30 * 10\nfailed to synthesize\n  HasEquiv \u211d\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nunsolved goals\nh_testStatistic : testStatistic = (85 - 80) / (10 / \u221a30)\nh_simplified : (85 - 80) / (10 / \u221a30) = 5 * \u221a30 / 10\nh_numerical : 5 * \u221a30 / 10 = \u221a30 / 2\n\u22a2 sorryAx (Sort ?u.14036) true\nfailed to synthesize\n  HasEquiv Float\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nunsolved goals\nh_testStatistic : testStatistic = (85 - 80) / (10 / \u221a30)\nh_simplified : (85 - 80) / (10 / \u221a30) = 5 * \u221a30 / 10\nh_numerical : 5 * \u221a30 / 10 = \u221a30 / 2\nh_sqrt_approx : sorryAx (Sort ?u.14036) true\n\u22a2 5.477225575051661 / 2 \u2248 2.7386127875258305\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase refine_1\nh_testStatistic : testStatistic = (85 - 80) / (10 / \u221a30)\nh_simplified : (85 - 80) / (10 / \u221a30) = 5 * \u221a30 / 10\nh_numerical : 5 * \u221a30 / 10 = \u221a30 / 2\nh_sqrt_approx : sorryAx (Sort ?u.14036) true\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\ntype mismatch\n  h_comparison\nhas type\n  \u221a30 / 2 > 1.645 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  testStatistic > criticalValue : Prop\nPlease revise the proof.",

Since c is in [a,b], we're looking at a part of the total interval.

The chain rule tells us we need to multiply the derivative of the outer function (with respect to u) by the derivative of the inner function (with respect to x).\n\nThe derivative of e^u with respect to u is e^u, and the derivative of 2x with respect to x is 2.

Here's how we can reason about this:\n\n1. First, let's position the cone in a coordinate system. We'll place the apex at the origin (0,0,0) and have the cone extend upward along the x-axis for height h. The base will be perpendicular to the x-axis at x = h.\n\n2. At any point x along the height, we have a circular cross-section. The radius of this cross-section varies linearly with x. We can find this relationship using similar triangles:\n   - At x = h, the radius is r (the full radius of the base)\n   - At x = 0, the radius is 0 (the apex)\n   - Therefore, at any point x, the radius R(x) = (r/h)x\n\n3. Each thin disk at position x has:\n   - A radius of R(x) = (r/h)x\n   - An area of \u03c0[R(x)]\u00b2 = \u03c0(r/h)\u00b2x\u00b2\n   - A thickness of dx\n\n4. To find the total volume, we need to add up (integrate) all these thin disks from x = 0 to x = h:\n   - We integrate \u03c0[R(x)]\u00b2 dx from 0 to h\n   - This gives us: V = \u222b\u2080\u02b0 \u03c0(r/h)\u00b2x\u00b2 dx\n\n5.

Here's why:\n\nThe cube function x^3 is continuous - it has no jumps or breaks. When we input values very close to 2, the outputs must be very close to 8 because:\n\n1. If we pick a value slightly less than 2 (say 1.99), its cube will be slightly less than 8\n   - 1.99^3 \u2248 7.880599\n\n2.

The cube function is well-behaved around x = 2 (it's continuous and smooth), so there's no way for the function to \"jump\" or \"escape\" to any other value besides 8 as x approaches 2.\n\nTherefore, we can make x^3 as close as we want to 8 by making x close enough to 2. This is precisely what it means for the limit to equal 8.\n\nThis reasoning shows that no matter how small a distance we specify around 8, we can find a corresponding distance around 2 such that all inputs within that distance of 2 produce outputs within our specified distance of 8.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  AddGroup \u2115\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  AddGroup \u2115\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  AddGroup \u2115\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  AddGroup \u2115\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  AddGroup \u2115\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  |?a| * |?b|\n\u03b5 : \u2115\n\u03b5_pos : \u03b5 > 0\nx : \u2115\nhx : |x - 2| = 0\n\u22a2 |x ^ 3 - 8| = sorryAx \u2115 true * |x ^ 2 + 2 * x + 4|\nunknown identifier 'h'\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, equality or iff proof expected\n  ?m.19925\ncase right.refine_1\n\u03b5 : \u2115\n\u03b5_pos : \u03b5 > 0\nx : \u2115\nhx : |x - 2| = 0\n\u22a2 AddGroup \u2115\nPlease revise the proof.",

We start with two rational numbers a/b and c/d, where:\n   - a and b are integers with b \u2260 0\n   - c and d are integers with d \u2260 0\n\n2.

This type of equation describes exponential decay, where the rate of change is proportional to the current value.\n\nTo solve this, we can reason as follows:\n\n1) The equation dy/dx = -2y tells us that at any point, the rate of change of y is negative two times the current value of y. This suggests an exponential function will be involved, since exponential functions have the special property that their derivative is proportional to themselves.\n\n2) The general solution to this type of equation will be of the form y = Ce^(-2x), where C is some constant.

By the definition of complex modulus, we know that |z| = \u221a(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2). Therefore, |z|^2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2.\n\nNow, to show this forms a parabola, we need to think about how this relates to the coordinate plane. When we're graphing y = |z|^2:\n- The horizontal axis represents the real part (a)\n- The vertical axis represents the imaginary part (b)\n- For any point (a,b) in the plane, the height of the surface above that point is a\u00b2 + b\u00b2\n\nThis means that for any point in the complex plane, we're plotting a point in 3D space where:\n- x-coordinate is a\n- y-coordinate is b\n- z-coordinate is a\u00b2 + b\u00b2\n\nThe equation z = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 is the key. This is equivalent to z = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 in standard coordinate notation, which is the standard form of a paraboloid in 3D space. If we were to take any vertical slice through this surface (keeping y constant), we would get a parabola of the form z = x\u00b2 + C, where C is some constant.\n\nSimilarly, if we take any horizontal slice (keeping x constant), we get another parabola z = y\u00b2 + C. The symmetry of the equation a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 tells us that this surface is rotationally symmetric around the z-axis.\n\nTherefore, |z|^2 creates a paraboloid surface that opens upward, with its vertex at the origin (0,0,0), and every vertical cross-section through the origin is a parabola. This proves that the graph of y = |z|^2 is indeed a paraboloid made up of parabolas.\n\nThe fact that this surface is always non-negative (since we're adding squares) and opens upward (due to the squared terms) further confirms its parabolic nature.",

Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. First, let's understand what points lie on the original line ax + by + c = 0:\n   - We can rewrite this in parametric form by expressing one variable in terms of the other\n   - For example, we can write y = (-a/b)x - c/b (assuming b \u2260 0)\n   - This means any point (x, y) on the line can be written as (t, (-a/b)t - c/b) where t is a parameter\n\n2. When we apply the linear transformation T to any point on this line:\n   - Each point (x, y) gets mapped to A(x, y)\n   - Due to the properties of linear transformations (shown in the context):\n     * T preserves linear combinations (from matrix multiplication distributivity)\n     * T(\u03b1x) = \u03b1T(x) for any scalar \u03b1\n\n3. Let's see what happens to our parametric line under T:\n   - For any point (t, (-a/b)t - c/b) on the original line\n   - T maps this to A(t, (-a/b)t - c/b)\n   - Due to linearity, this equals:\n     * A(t, 0) + A(0, (-a/b)t) + A(0, -c/b)\n     * = tA(1,0) + (-a/b)tA(0,1) + (-c/b)A(0,1)\n\n4. The resulting expression:\n   - Is linear in the parameter t\n   - Represents a line in \u211d\u00b2 because:\n     * It's a linear combination of fixed vectors (A(1,0) and A(0,1))\n     * Plus a constant vector (-c/b)A(0,1)\n   - Can be written in the form px + qy + r = 0 for some constants p, q, and r\n\nTherefore, the image of the original line under T is indeed a line, as it can be expressed as a linear equation in two variables with a constant term, which is the standard form of a line in \u211d\u00b2.\n\nThis proof relies heavily on the linearity properties of matrix transformations shown in the context theorems, particularly the fact that matrix multiplication distributes over addition and respects scalar multiplication.\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  A.mulVec x.1\nargument\n  x.1\nhas type\n  \u211d : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  Fin 2 \u2192 \u211d : Type\napplication type mismatch\n  A.mulVec x.2\nargument\n  x.2\nhas type\n  \u211d : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  Fin 2 \u2192 \u211d : Type\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "# Informal Proof:\n\nLet me explain how we can solve this problem step by step using geometric reasoning.\n\nFirst, let's understand what makes triangle BPC obtuse. According to the context, a triangle is obtuse if one of its angles is greater than 90 degrees. From the Law of Cosines and related theorems in the context, we know that in an obtuse triangle, the square of the longest side is greater than the sum of squares of the other two sides.\n\nFor triangle BPC:\n- We know BC is fixed at 2 units (a side of the square)\n- BP and PC are variable depending on point P's position\n- For the triangle to be obtuse, angle BPC must be greater than 90 degrees\n\nA key insight from the context about obtuse triangles is that if we draw a perpendicular line from one vertex to the line containing the opposite side (or its extension), the foot of this perpendicular falls outside the triangle.\n\nThis means that triangle BPC will be obtuse if and only if P lies in the region where BC appears to span an angle greater than 90 degrees. Geometrically, this occurs when P lies above the semicircle with BC as diameter.\n\nThe semicircle with BC as diameter divides the square into two regions:\n1. Points below the semicircle: form acute triangles with B and C\n2. Points above the semicircle: form obtuse triangles with B and C\n\nThe probability is therefore equal to:\n(Area of square region above the semicircle) / (Total area of square)\n\nThe square has area 4 square units (2\u00d72). The semicircle has radius 1 unit (half of BC) and area \u03c0r\u00b2/2 = \u03c0/2 square units.\n\nTherefore, the probability is:\n(4 - \u03c0/2)/4 = 1 - \u03c0/8\n\nThis represents the area of the square minus the area of the semicircle, divided by the total square area.\n\nThe key insight that makes this proof work is the connection between the geometric condition for obtuseness (from the context about perpendicular lines and obtuse triangles) and the fact that points above a semicircle form obtuse angles with the endpoints of its diameter.\nPrevious attempt failed with: type expected, got\n  (EuclideanSpace \u03b1 : Type ?u.6 \u2192 Type (max ?u.6 u_1))\noverloaded, errors \n  11:21 application type mismatch\n    Nat.dist A\n  argument\n    A\n  has type\n    \u03b1 : Sort ?u.44\n  but is expected to have type\n    \u2115 : Type\n  \n  failed to synthesize\n    Dist \u03b1\n  use `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\noverloaded, errors \n  11:42 application type mismatch\n    Nat.dist B\n  argument\n    B\n  has type\n    \u03b1 : Sort ?u.44\n  but is expected to have type\n    \u2115 : Type\n  \n  failed to synthesize\n    Dist \u03b1\n  use `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\noverloaded, errors \n  11:63 application type mismatch\n    Nat.dist C\n  argument\n    C\n  has type\n    \u03b1 : Sort ?u.44\n  but is expected to have type\n    \u2115 : Type\n  \n  failed to synthesize\n    Dist \u03b1\n  use `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\noverloaded, errors \n  11:84 application type mismatch\n    Nat.dist D\n  argument\n    D\n  has type\n    \u03b1 : Sort ?u.44\n  but is expected to have type\n    \u2115 : Type\n  \n  failed to synthesize\n    Dist \u03b1\n  use `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nambiguous, possible interpretations \n  \u03c0 : \u2115 \u2192 \u2115\n  \n  \u03c0 : \u211d\nambiguous, possible interpretations \n  \u03c0 : \u2115 \u2192 \u2115\n  \n  \u03c0 : \u211d\nsimp made no progress\nPlease revise the proof.",

This is known as the multiplicative identity property.\n\nThe key idea is that 1 plays a special role in multiplication - it's the number that leaves other numbers unchanged when we multiply by it. Here's why this works:\n\nWhen we construct the integers, we start with natural numbers and build up from there. The number 1 is defined in such a way that it has this special property built into its very nature. We can think about this intuitively in a few ways:\n\n1. First, consider what multiplication means fundamentally - when we multiply by 1, we're essentially taking one copy of our original number. Just like if you have 5 apples and you take them 1 time, you still have 5 apples.\n\n2. This property is so fundamental that it's actually part of how we define multiplication in the first place. When we formally construct the integers, we specifically define multiplication so that 1 acts as this special number that preserves whatever it multiplies.\n\n3. The property works regardless of whether we multiply 1 on the left or right side of any number. That is, for any number n, both 1 \u00d7 n and n \u00d7 1 equal n. This is because multiplication of integers is commutative (order doesn't matter).\n\nThis isn't just a coincidence or a useful trick - it's a fundamental property that we rely on for many other mathematical proofs and operations. Without this property, much of our number system wouldn't work the way we need it to.\n\nSo in essence, when we multiply any number by 1, we get back the same number because that's exactly what 1 was designed to do - it's the number that, when used as a multiplier, preserves the value of whatever it multiplies.",

In this system, any point in the sphere can be uniquely described by:\n- r (distance from origin)\n- \u03c6 (angle from positive z-axis, ranging from 0 to \u03c0)\n- \u03b8 (angle in xy-plane from positive x-axis, ranging from 0 to 2\u03c0)\n\n2) The term r\u00b2 sin(\u03c6) in dV is actually the Jacobian determinant - it accounts for the \"stretching\" of space when we convert from rectangular to spherical coordinates. This factor is necessary because as we move away from the origin, the \"shells\" of constant r have increasing surface area.\n\n3) To find the total volume, we need to integrate over all possible values of these coordinates:\n- r goes from 0 to R (where R is the radius of the sphere)\n- \u03c6 goes from 0 to \u03c0\n- \u03b8 goes from 0 to 2\u03c0\n\nWhen we integrate, we're essentially adding up infinitesimally small volume elements (dV) over the entire sphere. Each small volume element is like a tiny curved rectangular box whose dimensions are determined by small changes in r, \u03c6, and \u03b8.\n\nThe integration process can be visualized as:\n- First, sweeping through all values of \u03b8 to form a circular arc\n- Then varying \u03c6 to create a spherical shell\n- Finally, varying r to fill the entire sphere from center to surface\n\nWhen we evaluate this triple integral:\n\u222b\u2080\u1d3f \u222b\u2080\u1d56\u2071 \u222b\u2080\u00b2\u1d56\u2071 r\u00b2 sin(\u03c6) d\u03b8 d\u03c6 dr\n\nThe result will give us 4\u03c0R\u00b3/3, which matches the classical formula for the volume of a sphere that we can derive through other methods (like the disk method shown in the context).\n\nThis approach is particularly elegant because it naturally accounts for the sphere's symmetry and provides a direct way to compute volumes of spherical regions that might be more complicated to calculate using other methods.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unexpected token '\u03c6'; expected '_' or identifier\nPlease revise the proof.",

Here's how we can understand this:\n\n1. First, let's consider what makes a right triangle special - it has one 90-degree angle, and the other two angles must sum to 90 degrees (since all triangles have angles summing to 180 degrees).\n\n2. If we draw squares on each side of the right triangle:\n   - A square of area a\u00b2 on one leg\n   - A square of area b\u00b2 on the other leg \n   - A square of area c\u00b2 on the hypotenuse\n\n3. The relationship between these squares is the key to our proof. The areas of the squares on the legs (a\u00b2 and b\u00b2) together equal the area of the square on the hypotenuse (c\u00b2).\n\n4. We can understand this by:\n   - Recognizing that the right angle creates a unique geometric relationship between these squares\n   - The square on the hypotenuse can be divided and rearranged to exactly fill the squares on the other two sides\n   - This geometric relationship means that a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2\n\n5. Therefore:\n   - If a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2\n   - Then c must equal the square root of (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)\n   - Because taking the square root of both sides of a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2 gives us c = \u221a(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)\n\nThis relationship holds true for every right triangle, regardless of its specific dimensions, because it's based on the fundamental property of right triangles - the 90-degree angle and the resulting geometric relationships between the squares of its sides.\n\nThe beauty of this proof lies in how it connects the algebraic relationship (c = \u221a(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)) to the geometric reality of the squares drawn on each side of the right triangle.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown constant 'Real.sqrt'\nunknown constant 'Real.sqrt'\nunknown constant 'Real.sqrt'\nunsolved goals\na b : \u211d\nh : a \u2265 0 \u2227 b \u2265 0\n\u22a2 let c := sorryAx (?m.84 a b h) true;\n  c = sorryAx (?m.84 a b h) true\nPlease revise the proof.",

The key insight is that the derivative tells us about the rate of change of the function, and if this rate is always zero, the function cannot change at all.\n\nHere's how we can think about this:\n\nFirst, let's consider any two points x\u2081 and x\u2082 in our interval (a, b). If we can show that f(x\u2081) = f(x\u2082) for any such points, then we'll have proven that f is constant.\n\nThe Mean Value Theorem gives us a powerful tool here. It tells us that between any two points, there must be at least one point where the instantaneous rate of change (the derivative) equals the average rate of change between those points.\n\nSo, between our points x\u2081 and x\u2082, there must be some point c where:\nf'(c) = [f(x\u2082) - f(x\u2081)] / (x\u2082 - x\u2081)\n\nBut we know that f'(x) = 0 everywhere in the interval, including at point c. Therefore:\n0 = [f(x\u2082) - f(x\u2081)] / (x\u2082 - x\u2081)\n\nMultiply both sides by (x\u2082 - x\u2081):\n0 = f(x\u2082) - f(x\u2081)\n\nTherefore:\nf(x\u2082) = f(x\u2081)\n\nSince x\u2081 and x\u2082 were any arbitrary points in our interval, this means that f takes the same value at every point in the interval. This is precisely what it means for f to be constant.\n\nThe intuition here is that if a function's rate of change is always zero, it can never increase or decrease as we move along the x-axis, so it must maintain the same value throughout its domain.\nPrevious attempt failed with: function expected at\n  Ioo\nterm has type\n  ?m.91\nfunction expected at\n  Ioo\nterm has type\n  ?m.91\nfunction expected at\n  Ioo\nterm has type\n  ?m.91\nfunction expected at\n  Ioo\nterm has type\n  x\u271d\nunsolved goals\nx\u271d : Sort u_1\nIoo : x\u271d\nf : \u211d \u2192 \u211d\na b : \u211d\nhab : a < b\nhf : \u2200 x \u2208 ?m.3911 f a b hab x, HasDerivAt f 0 x\nx : \u211d\nhx : x \u2208 ?m.3904 f a b hab hf x\ny : \u211d\nhy : y \u2208 ?m.3910 f a b hab hf x y\n\u22a2 f x = f y\nPlease revise the proof.",

We can break this down into steps:\n\nFirst, when we add two 2x2 matrices, we're simply adding the corresponding elements in each position. So if we have matrices A and B, their sum gives us a new matrix where each element is the sum of the corresponding elements from A and B.\n\nNow, when we apply a transformation to a matrix, it affects each element according to some rule. Let's call this transformation T. The important thing is that this transformation will work the same way regardless of whether we apply it to individual matrices first and then add, or add first and then transform.\n\nThis works because:\n1. When we transform A and B separately and then add the results, each element has been transformed independently and then added.\n2. When we add A and B first and then transform the result, we're transforming the sum of corresponding elements.\n\nSince we're working with the same elements and the transformation is applied consistently, the order doesn't matter - we'll get the same result either way. This is similar to how in regular arithmetic, if we have a function f and numbers x and y, often f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y).\n\nThe key point is that the transformation preserves the additive relationship between the matrices' elements, making the order of operations (whether we transform first or add first) irrelevant to the final result.\n\nThis property is often called the \"distributive property\" of the transformation over matrix addition, and it's a fundamental characteristic of many important matrix transformations.",

Now, let's think about what happens near x = 4:\n   - If x is slightly less than 4, say 3.9:\n     f(3.9) = 3(3.9) + 2 = 11.7 + 2 = 13.7\n   - If x is slightly more than 4, say 4.1:\n     f(4.1) = 3(4.1) + 2 = 12.3 + 2 = 14.3\n\n3. The function f(x) = 3x + 2 is a linear function, which means:\n   - It's continuous everywhere\n   - It has no jumps or breaks\n   - As x moves continuously, f(x) also moves continuously\n   - The rate of change is constant (3 in this case)\n\n4. Because of these properties:\n   - As x gets closer and closer to 4\n   - f(x) must get closer and closer to 14\n   - We can make f(x) as close as we want to 14 by taking x close enough to 4\n\n5. Since there are no discontinuities or jumps:\n   - The function approaches the same value (14) from both sides\n   - This approach is smooth and predictable due to the linear nature of the function\n\nTherefore, the limit of f(x) = 3x + 2 as x approaches 4 must be 14, as this is the value that f(x) approaches arbitrarily closely as x gets arbitrarily close to 4.\nPrevious attempt failed with: function expected at\n  Tendsto\nterm has type\n  ?m.3\ninvalid field notation, type is not of the form (C ...) where C is a constant\n  Tendsto\nhas type\n  x\u271d\nPlease revise the proof.",

This is essentially a division problem.\n\nThe reasoning goes like this:\n\nWhen we distribute objects equally, we are dividing the total number of objects by the number of recipients. In this case, we have 20 apples (the total) being divided by 5 friends (the recipients).\n\nWe can verify this is a valid division because:\n1. 20 is divisible by 5 (it's an integer division with no remainder)\n2. The result must be a whole number since we can't give a fraction of an apple\n\nTo prove the answer is 4 apples per friend, we can show that:\n- 4 apples \u00d7 5 friends = 20 apples (multiplication check)\n- This accounts for all apples (none left over)\n- Each friend gets the same amount (equal distribution requirement)\n\nTherefore, since 20 \u00f7 5 = 4, and this solution satisfies all our requirements (whole number of apples, equal distribution, uses all apples), we can conclude that each friend must get exactly 4 apples.",

To find the initial area of the garden:\n   - The area of a rectangle is length \u00d7 width\n   - So the initial area is 8 \u00d7 6 = 48 square meters\n\n2. To find the area of the removed section:\n   - The removed section is 4 meters \u00d7 3 meters\n   - So the removed area is 4 \u00d7 3 = 12 square meters\n\n3. To find the remaining area:\n   - We subtract the removed area from the initial area\n   - Remaining area = Initial area - Removed area\n   - Remaining area = 48 - 12 = 36 square meters\n\nTherefore, the remaining area of the garden is 36 square meters. This makes intuitive sense because the removed section (12 square meters) is exactly one-fourth of the original garden area (48 square meters), so three-fourths of the original area (36 square meters) remains.\n\nThis solution doesn't depend on where in the garden the section was removed from, as we're only concerned with the total area remaining, not its shape.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

Looking at the Primitive of Power theorem from the context, we can treat this as 2x^1, where the coefficient is 2 and n = 1. Using the power rule for integration, when we integrate x^n, we get x^(n+1)/(n+1). Therefore:\n\nThe primitive of 2x will be 2(x^2/2) = x^2 + C, where C is the constant of integration.\n\nNow, to find the definite integral from 0 to 3, we need to:\n1. Evaluate the primitive at the upper bound (x = 3)\n2. Evaluate the primitive at the lower bound (x = 0)\n3. Subtract the lower bound result from the upper bound result\n\nSo:\n- At x = 3: (3)^2 = 9\n- At x = 0: (0)^2 = 0\n- The difference: 9 - 0 = 9\n\nThis shows that the integral of 2x from 0 to 3 equals 9.\n\nThe result can be verified by considering the geometric interpretation - since f(x) = 2x is a linear function, the area under the curve forms a triangle with base 3 and height 6 (when x = 3, f(3) = 6), and the area of this triangle is (3 \u00d7 6)/2 = 9.",

When we multiply a sum of vectors by a scalar, it should give the same result as if we had multiplied each vector by the scalar separately and then added the results.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\nWhen we have two vectors a and b, and we add them together, we get a new vector (a+b). When we multiply this combined vector by a scalar c, we are essentially stretching or shrinking the resulting vector by a factor of c.\n\nNow, if we instead took each vector separately, multiplied each by c, and then added the results, we would be:\n1. Stretching/shrinking vector a by a factor of c to get c*a\n2. Stretching/shrinking vector b by a factor of c to get c*b\n3.

This is because scaling preserves the relative relationships between vectors, and addition combines vectors in a way that maintains their proportions.\n\nThis property is actually one of the fundamental axioms of a real vector space, as it ensures that scalar multiplication behaves consistently with our intuitive understanding of scaling and adding vectors. The property holds because the real numbers (our scalars) interact with vector addition in a way that preserves the linear structure of the vector space.\n\nTherefore, c*(a+b) must equal c*a + c*b for any vectors a and b and any scalar c in a real vector space.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  HSMul \u211d (\u211d ^ 3) ?m.587\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  HPow Type \u2115 Type\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  HPow Type \u2115 Type\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

This is what we call an arithmetic sequence, where each term differs from the previous term by a constant amount (in this case, -$200).\n\nTo find the 8th month's profit, we can think about how many decreases of $200 occur from the first month to the eighth month. Since we start at month 1 and want to find month 8, there are 7 decreases of $200 that take place.\n\nWe can calculate this by:\n1. Starting with the initial profit ($1000)\n2. Multiplying the number of decreases (7) by the amount of each decrease (-$200)\n3. Adding this total decrease to the initial profit\n\nSo the calculation would be:\n$1000 + (7 \u00d7 (-$200))$\n= $1000 - $1400$\n= -$400\n\nTherefore, by the 8th month, the company's profit has actually become a loss of $400. This makes sense because the constant monthly decrease of $200 eventually turns the initial $1000 profit into a negative number (loss) after enough months have passed.\n\nThe reasoning follows directly from the properties of arithmetic sequences, where any term can be found by adding the common difference multiplied by the number of intervals to the first term.",

Here's how we can think about it:\n\n1. First, let's define F(t) as the integral of f(t) from 0 to t:\n   F(t) = \u222b\u2080\u1d57 f(u) du\n\n2. By the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, we know that:\n   - F'(t) = f(t)  (the derivative of the integral gives back the original function)\n   - F(0) = 0 (since we're integrating from 0 to 0)\n\n3. Now, we can use a key property of Laplace transforms: the relationship between the transform of a derivative and the transform of the function itself. From the Laplace transform of derivatives property, we know that:\n   L[F'(t)] = s\u00b7L[F(t)] - F(0)\n\n4. We can substitute what we know:\n   - L[F'(t)] = L[f(t)] (since F'(t) = f(t))\n   - F(0) = 0 (from step 2)\n\n5. This gives us:\n   L[f(t)] = s\u00b7L[F(t)] - 0\n\n6. Solving for L[F(t)]:\n   L[F(t)] = (1/s)\u00b7L[f(t)]\n\nThe beauty of this proof is that it avoids direct manipulation of complex integrals and instead relies on the relationship between differentiation and integration, combined with known properties of Laplace transforms. The result shows that integrating a function before taking its Laplace transform is equivalent to taking the Laplace transform first and then dividing by s.\n\nThis relationship is particularly useful in solving differential equations, as it allows us to convert integration operations in the time domain into simple algebraic operations in the s-domain.\nPrevious attempt failed with: invalid field notation, type is not of the form (C ...) where C is a constant\n  set\nhas type\n  ?m.242 \u2192 ?m.243 PUnit.{?u.241 + 1}\nunknown identifier 'complex.exp'\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.measureSpace', and it does not have executable code\ninvalid field notation, type is not of the form (C ...) where C is a constant\n  set\nhas type\n  ?m.743 \u2192 ?m.744 PUnit.{?u.742 + 1}\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.measureSpace', and it does not have executable code\nunexpected token ','; expected '\u21a6', '=>'\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

Let's break this down into logical steps:\n\n1) First, we know that f(x) \u2265 0 for all x in [a,b] (given that f is non-negative)\n\n2) We're also given that the total integral from a to b equals 1:\n   \u222b[a to b] f(x)dx = 1\n\n3) Now, let's think about what happens when we integrate from a to some point c in [a,b]:\n   - Since c is in [a,b], we can split the full integral into two parts:\n   \u222b[a to b] f(x)dx = \u222b[a to c] f(x)dx + \u222b[c to b] f(x)dx = 1\n\n4) The key observation is that \u222b[c to b] f(x)dx must be non-negative because:\n   - f(x) is non-negative everywhere\n   - By the Sign of Function Matches Sign of Definite Integral theorem (from context), integrating a non-negative function gives a non-negative result\n\n5) Therefore:\n   - \u222b[a to c] f(x)dx + \u222b[c to b] f(x)dx = 1\n   - \u222b[c to b] f(x)dx \u2265 0\n   - This means \u222b[a to c] f(x)dx must be \u2264 1\n\nThis proves that for any c in [a,b], the integral from a to c cannot exceed 1.

This proof relies on key properties of the least squares method used to fit the regression line.\n\nFirst, let's understand what we're working with:\n- We have actual values yi and predicted values \u0177i\n- The residuals are the differences (yi - \u0177i)\n- The regression line is fitted using the method of least squares\n- The y-intercept (\u03b20) and slope (\u03b21) are chosen to minimize the sum of squared residuals\n\nThe key insight is that when we use the least squares method to find the best-fitting line, we're actually finding values of \u03b20 and \u03b21 that minimize the sum of squared residuals. This minimization process leads to what are called the \"normal equations.\"\n\nOne of these normal equations - specifically the one we get when we minimize with respect to \u03b20 (the y-intercept) - tells us something crucial: at the minimum, the partial derivative of the sum of squared residuals with respect to \u03b20 must be zero.\n\nWhen we work through this derivative, we find that it's equivalent to saying that the sum of the residuals must be zero. Here's why:\n- If the sum of residuals were positive, we could lower the y-intercept slightly\n- If the sum were negative, we could raise the y-intercept slightly\n- In either case, this would reduce the sum of squared residuals\n- Since we're at the minimum, neither adjustment should help\n- Therefore, the sum of residuals must be zero\n\nThis is also intuitive geometrically: the regression line passes through the point (x\u0304, \u0233) - the means of x and y.

Start with the initial amount (75)\n2. Subtract what the squirrel took (40)\n3. Subtract what the bird took (50)\n\nSo: 75 - 40 = 35 apples after the squirrel\nThen: 35 - 50 = -15 apples after the bird\n\nThe answer is -15 apples, which is a negative number. This negative result has a practical meaning in the real world: it means the bird tried to take more apples than were actually available in the basket.\n\nWhen the squirrel was done, there were 35 apples left. Since the bird then tried to take 50 apples, but only 35 were available, this creates an impossible situation in reality. The negative number (-15) tells us that the bird wanted to take 15 more apples than were actually there.\n\nIn real life, the bird would only be able to take the remaining 35 apples, leaving 0 apples in the basket.

The first equation tells us that when we add x and y, we get 10. The second equation tells us that when we subtract y from x, we get 2. These two pieces of information together should give us enough to find unique values for both x and y.\n\nThe key insight is that we can use these equations together to eliminate one variable and solve for the other. Let's think about what these equations mean together:\n- When x and y are added, they sum to 10\n- When y is subtracted from x, the difference is 2\n\nIf we add these equations together, something interesting happens. The first equation gives us (x + y) and the second gives us (x - y). When we add these, we get:\n(x + y) + (x - y) = 10 + 2\n\nThis simplifies to 2x = 12, because the y terms cancel each other out.

Since the hypotenuse is a diameter of the circle, and the triangle is right-angled and isosceles:\n   - The hypotenuse is 2 units (diameter of a circle with radius 1)\n   - The two other sides are equal (isosceles)\n   - The two non-right angles are each 45 degrees (since they're equal and must sum to 90 degrees)\n\n2. To find the area of the triangle:\n   - In a right-angled isosceles triangle, the two legs are equal\n   - If the hypotenuse is 2 units, each leg must be \u221a2 units\n   - The area of the triangle is (base \u00d7 height)/2 = (\u221a2 \u00d7 \u221a2)/2 = 1 square unit\n\n3.

Then plants flowers in half of that remaining 1/3\n\nTo find the fraction planted with flowers, we need to calculate half of one-third.

When multiplying fractions, we multiply the numerators together and denominators together.\n\nTherefore, the flowers occupy 1/6 of the total garden area (since 1/2 \u00d7 1/3 = 1/6), which we can verify is reasonable since it's a smaller portion than both the original 2/3 used for vegetables and the 1/3 that was remaining.\n\nThis solution shows how sequential operations on fractions (first subtraction to find remaining space, then multiplication to find the portion of that space) lead us to the final answer.",

Here's why:\n\nSuppose we have a continuous function f on [a,b] whose integral from a to b equals zero. The Mean Value Theorem for integrals tells us that there must be some point c in [a,b] where f(c) equals the average value of the function over the interval.\n\nSince we know the integral is zero, and the average value of a function over an interval is equal to its integral divided by the length of the interval, we can write:\n\nThe average value = (1/(b-a)) * \u222b[a to b] f(x)dx = 0\n\nTherefore, there must exist a point c in [a,b] where f(c) equals this average value, which is 0.\n\nTo see why this must be true, imagine if f never equaled zero on the interval. Then f would be either entirely positive or entirely negative (since f is continuous, it can't jump from positive to negative without crossing zero). But if f were entirely positive, its integral would be positive, and if f were entirely negative, its integral would be negative. The only way for a continuous function to have a zero integral is to have some positive parts and some negative parts, which means it must cross zero somewhere.\n\nThe continuity of f is crucial here - it ensures that f must actually attain the value zero somewhere in the interval, rather than just approaching it or jumping over it.\n\nTherefore, there must exist some point c in [a,b] where f(c) = 0.\nPrevious attempt failed with: function expected at\n  Icc\nterm has type\n  ?m.386\nfunction expected at\n  Icc\nterm has type\n  ?m.386\nfunction expected at\n  Icc\nterm has type\n  x\u271d\nunsolved goals\nx\u271d : Sort u_1\nIcc : x\u271d\nf : \u211d \u2192 \u211d\na b : \u211d\nhab : a < b\nhf : ContinuousOn f (sorryAx (Set \u211d) true)\nh_int : \u222b (x : \u211d) in a..b, f x = 0\n\u22a2 \u2203 c \u2208 ?m.2720 f a b hab hf h_int c, f c = 0\nPlease revise the proof.",

We have:\n- Two vectors u and v\n- A scalar c\n- The slope of u is twice the slope of v\n- We need to prove that the slope of (cu + v) equals the slope of u\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\nWhen we talk about the slope of a vector, we're essentially talking about how much it rises vertically for each unit of horizontal movement. In vector terms, if we represent our vectors in component form, the slope is the ratio of the y-component to the x-component.\n\nGiven that the slope of u is twice the slope of v, we can write:\nIf we call the slope of u as m\u2081 and the slope of v as m\u2082, then m\u2081 = 2m\u2082\n\nNow, when we perform the operation cu + v, we're:\n1. First multiplying vector u by scalar c, which scales both components of u equally, thus preserving its slope\n2. Then adding vector v to this scaled vector\n\nThe key insight is that when we add vectors, the resulting slope is not a simple arithmetic combination of the individual slopes. Instead, the slope of the sum depends on the relative magnitudes of the vectors involved.\n\nWhen we multiply u by c, we're creating a vector that dominates the addition (assuming c is large enough), and when we add v to it, the resulting slope will be pulled closer to the slope of cu than to the slope of v.\n\nIn fact, as c becomes larger, the influence of v on the final slope becomes increasingly negligible, and the slope of cu + v approaches the slope of cu, which is the same as the slope of u.\n\nThis explains why the slope of cu + v equals the slope of u - the scalar multiplication creates a dominant vector that essentially determines the slope of the final sum, with v having minimal impact on the final direction.\n\nThis informal argument helps us understand intuitively why the statement must be true, though a formal proof would require specific algebraic manipulation of the vector components.\nPrevious attempt failed with: invalid binder annotation, type is not a class instance\n  ?m.12\nuse the command `set_option checkBinderAnnotations false` to disable the check\n'slope' has already been declared\nfailed to synthesize\n  Field V\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  HMul \u211d V (?m.1949 w)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  Field V\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  HMul \u211d V (?m.3581 w)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  Field V\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  HMul \u211d V (?m.5898 w)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  Field V\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  HMul \u211d V (?m.7363 w)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nunsolved goals\nV : Type ?u.387\nu v : V\nc : \u211d\nslope_u_twice_slope_v : \u2200 (f : V \u2192 \u211d), f u = 2 * f v\n\u22a2 sorryAx ?m.3620 true = sorryAx ?m.3620 true\nPlease revise the proof.",

This means that for any x in [a,b], f(x) is always greater than or equal to k and less than or equal to m.\n\nNow, think about what the definite integral represents geometrically - it's the area between the function and the x-axis over the interval [a,b]. This area can be approximated by rectangles, and as we make these rectangles infinitely thin, we get the exact integral.\n\nFor any point x in [a,b], since k \u2264 f(x) \u2264 m, if we multiply these inequalities by a small positive width dx, the inequalities still hold. When we add up all these tiny pieces across the interval [a,b], we get:\n\nThe sum of k*dx over the interval gives us k*(b-a), which forms a lower bound.\nThe sum of m*dx over the interval gives us m*(b-a), which forms an upper bound.\n\nThis is exactly what Darboux's Theorem tells us - the integral must lie between these bounds. We can be confident this is true because:\n1. The function never goes below k or above m (by the Extreme Value Theorem)\n2. The width of the interval is (b-a)\n3.

Then we can use this to show the values at the endpoints must be equal.\n\nHere's the reasoning step by step:\n\n1. First, let's understand what it means for f'(x) to be zero everywhere in the interval (x1, x2). This tells us that at every point in this interval, the instantaneous rate of change of the function is zero.\n\n2. When a function has a derivative of zero at a point, it means the tangent line at that point is horizontal. In this case, we have horizontal tangent lines everywhere in the interval (x1, x2).\n\n3. A fundamental theorem of calculus tells us that if a function's derivative is zero on an interval, then the function must be constant on that interval. This is because:\n   - If the rate of change is always zero\n   - Then the function cannot increase or decrease\n   - Therefore the function must maintain the same value throughout the interval\n\n4. Since f(x) is constant on the interval (x1, x2), this means that for any two points in this interval, the function values must be equal.\n\n5. Since x1 and x2 are in the interval where f is constant, we can conclude that f(x1) = f(x2).\n\nThis proof relies on the fundamental connection between a function's derivative and its behavior - specifically, that a zero derivative implies constant function values. The continuity of the function (which comes from its differentiability) ensures that this constant value extends to the endpoints x1 and x2.\nPrevious attempt failed with: function expected at\n  Ioo\nterm has type\n  ?m.91\nfunction expected at\n  Ioo\nterm has type\n  x\u271d\nunsolved goals\nx\u271d : Sort u_1\nIoo : x\u271d\nf : \u211d \u2192 \u211d\nx1 x2 : \u211d\nh : x1 < x2\nhf : \u2200 x \u2208 ?m.1606 f x1 x2 h x, HasDerivAt f 0 x\n\u22a2 f x1 = f x2\nPlease revise the proof.",

We can do this by integrating each term:\n- For x^2: The antiderivative is (x^3)/3\n- For 2ix: The antiderivative is ix^2\n- For -3: The antiderivative is -3x\n\nSo, F(x) = (x^3)/3 + ix^2 - 3x\n\nNow, according to the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus for Complex Riemann Integrals, we can find the integral by calculating F(1) - F(-1):\n\nAt x = 1:\nF(1) = 1/3 + i(1) - 3 = -8/3 + i\n\nAt x = -1:\nF(-1) = -1/3 + i(1) - (-3) = 8/3 + i\n\nTherefore, \u222bf(x)dx from -1 to 1 = F(1) - F(-1) = (-8/3 + i) - (8/3 + i)\n                                                = -16/3 + i - i\n                                                = -16/3 + 0i\n                                                = -16/3\n\nThe result is a real number because:\n1. The imaginary terms (i) cancelled out\n2. We're left with only the real term -16/3\n3. This makes sense geometrically because when we integrate over a symmetric interval [-1,1], the imaginary part (2ix) produces equal and opposite contributions that cancel out, while the real parts (x^2 - 3) accumulate.\n\nTherefore, the integral equals -16/3, which is a real number.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'I'\nfailed to synthesize\n  HMul \u2102 (Sort (max 1 ?u.548)) ?m.3997\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  HSub \u2115 \u2102 (Sort ?u.548)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\ninvalid argument, variable is not a proposition or let-declaration\nsimp made no progress\ninvalid argument, variable is not a proposition or let-declaration\nsimp made no progress\nunsolved goals\n\u22a2 F 1 - F (-1) = -16 / 3\nno goals to be solved\nPlease revise the proof.",

We need to find what fraction of the total area is the original garden\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\nThe original garden is a 6m \u00d7 4m rectangle, so its area is 24 square meters.\n\nWhen we add a 1m path around all sides:\n- The length increases by 2m (1m on each end), becoming 8m\n- The width increases by 2m (1m on each side), becoming 6m\n- The total area of the new structure (garden + path) is therefore 8m \u00d7 6m = 48 square meters\n\nSince the original garden area is 24 square meters and the total area is 48 square meters:\n- The fraction of the total area occupied by the garden is 24/48\n- This simplifies to 1/2 or 0.5 or 50%\n\nTo verify this makes sense:\n- The path forms a rectangular \"frame\" around the garden\n- The total structure is exactly twice the size of the original garden\n- This aligns with our calculated fraction of 1/2\n\nTherefore, the garden occupies exactly one-half of the total area of the new structure.\n\nThis solution follows similar principles to the garden path problem shown in the context, but is simpler because we're working with a rectangular shape and only need to find a ratio rather than the exact path area.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

When we have an even number of values, there isn't a single middle number, so we need a way to find a value that properly divides the set.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. First, when we arrange n numbers in ascending order, we have an ordered sequence where each number is greater than or equal to all numbers before it.\n\n2. Since n is even, we can split the sequence exactly in half. The first half contains n/2 numbers, and the second half contains n/2 numbers.\n\n3. The (n/2)th number is the last number in the first half, and the ((n/2)+1)th number is the first number in the second half.\n\n4. Any number smaller than the (n/2)th number would leave more than half the numbers above it, and any number larger than the ((n/2)+1)th number would leave more than half the numbers below it.\n\n5. Therefore, the true middle value must lie between these two numbers. Since we want a single value that best represents the middle, we take the average of these two numbers.\n\n6. Taking the average ensures that:\n   - The resulting value lies exactly between the two middle numbers\n   - There are exactly n/2 numbers less than or equal to this value\n   - There are exactly n/2 numbers greater than or equal to this value\n\nThis makes the average of the (n/2)th and ((n/2)+1)th numbers the only value that properly divides the data set into two equal halves, which is the definition of the median for an even set of numbers.\n\nThe proof relies on the fundamental properties of ordered sequences and the definition of a median as a central value that divides a dataset into equal halves.

The equation y'' - y = 0 is similar to the standard form y'' + y = 0, but with a negative sign\n2. We have initial conditions y(0) = 1 and y'(0) = 0\n3. We're asked to express the solution in terms of a new basis v1 = (1,0) and v2 = (0,1)\n\nThe general solution approach would be:\n\n1. Find the general solution to y'' - y = 0\n- This is similar to y'' + y = 0, but the negative sign changes the characteristic equation\n- Instead of oscillating solutions (sin and cos), we expect exponential solutions\n- The general solution will be of the form y = C\u2081e^x + C\u2082e^(-x)\n\n2. Apply the initial conditions:\n- At x = 0: y(0) = 1 means C\u2081 + C\u2082 = 1\n- At x = 0: y'(0) = 0 means C\u2081 - C\u2082 = 0\n\n3. Solve for constants:\n- From these conditions, we can deduce that C\u2081 = C\u2082 = 1/2\n\n4. Express in the new basis:\n- The solution y = (1/2)e^x + (1/2)e^(-x) is actually the hyperbolic cosine function cosh(x)\n- In the new coordinate system (v1,v2), this is equivalent to expressing the solution as:\n  y = cosh(x) = (1/2)(v1 + v2)e^x + (1/2)(v1 + v2)e^(-x)\n\nTherefore, the complete solution in the new coordinate system is:\ny(x) = cosh(x) expressed in terms of v1 and v2, which gives us:\ny(x) = v1\u00b7cosh(x) + v2\u00b70\n\nThis solution satisfies both the differential equation and the initial conditions while being expressed in the new coordinate system.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'y'''\nunknown identifier 'y''\ncompiler IR check failed at 'solution', error: unknown declaration 'Real.cosh'\napplication type mismatch\n  diff_eq solution\nargument\n  solution\nhas type\n  \u211d \u2192 Fin 2 \u2192 \u211d : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u211d \u2192 \u211d : Type\nsimp made no progress\napplication type mismatch\n  init_cond solution\nargument\n  solution\nhas type\n  \u211d \u2192 Fin 2 \u2192 \u211d : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u211d \u2192 \u211d : Type\nunsolved goals\ncase left\n\u22a2 sorryAx (\u211d \u2192 \u211d) true 0 = 1\nsimp made no progress\napplication type mismatch\n  diff_eq y\nargument\n  y\nhas type\n  \u211d \u2192 Fin 2 \u2192 \u211d : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u211d \u2192 \u211d : Type\napplication type mismatch\n  init_cond y\nargument\n  y\nhas type\n  \u211d \u2192 Fin 2 \u2192 \u211d : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u211d \u2192 \u211d : Type\nPlease revise the proof.",
