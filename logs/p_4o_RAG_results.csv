exercise_1_13b,"/-- Suppose that $f$ is holomorphic in an open set $\Omega$. Prove that if $\text{Im}(f)$ is constant, then $f$ is constant.-/
",0,1,139012,"# Informal Proof:\n\nTo prove that a holomorphic function \( f \) with a constant imaginary part is itself constant, let's break down the problem using the properties of holomorphic functions and the Cauchy-Riemann equations.\n\nFirst, recall that a holomorphic function \( f \) on an open set \(\Omega\) in the complex plane can be expressed in terms of its real and imaginary parts. Specifically, if \( f(z) = f(x + iy) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y) \), where \( u \) and \( v \) are real-valued functions, then \( u \) represents the real part and \( v \) the imaginary part of \( f \).\n\nGiven that the imaginary part \( v(x, y) \) is constant, it means that \( v(x, y) = c \) for some constant \( c \). When a function is constant, its partial derivatives with respect to any variable are zero. Therefore, we have:\n\n\[\n\frac{\partial v}{\partial x} = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} = 0.\n\]\n\nNow, let's use the Cauchy-Riemann equations, which are a set of conditions that \( u \) and \( v \) must satisfy for \( f \) to be holomorphic. These equations state:\n\n\[\n\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = -\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}.\n\]\n\nSince both partial derivatives of \( v \) are zero, the Cauchy-Riemann equations simplify to:\n\n\[\n\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = 0.\n\]\n\nThese equations imply that \( u \) is also constant because a function with zero partial derivatives with respect to all its variables is constant. Therefore, \( u(x, y) = k \) for some constant \( k \).\n\nSince both \( u \) and \( v \) are constant, the function \( f(x + iy) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y) = k + ic \) is constant across the entire domain \(\Omega\).\n\nThus, we have shown that if the imaginary part of a holomorphic function is constant, then the entire function must be constant.","# Start\n```lean4\nimport Mathlib\n\nopen Complex Filter Function Metric Finset\nopen scoped BigOperators Topology\n\ntheorem exercise_1_13b {f : ℂ → ℂ} (Ω : Set ℂ) (a b : Ω) (h : IsOpen Ω)\n  (hf : DifferentiableOn ℂ f Ω) (hc : ∃ (c : ℝ), ∀ z ∈ Ω, (f z).im = c) :\n  f a = f b :=\nbegin\n  obtain ⟨c, hc⟩ := hc,\n  have h_const_im : ∀ z ∈ Ω, (f z).im = c := hc,\n  have h_const_f : ∀ z ∈ Ω, f z = f a,\n  { intros z hz,\n    have h_diff : DifferentiableOn ℂ (fun z => (f z).im) Ω := hf.comp (differentiable_id.differentiableOn) (λ z hz, differentiableAt_id),\n    have h_const_diff : DifferentiableOn ℂ (fun z => c) Ω := differentiableOn_const c,\n    have h_eq : (fun z => (f z).im) = (fun z => c) := funext (λ z, funext (λ hz, eq.symm (h_const_im z hz))),\n    have h_diff_eq : DifferentiableOn ℂ (fun z => (f z).im) Ω = DifferentiableOn ℂ (fun z => c) Ω := congr_arg differentiableOn h_eq,\n    have h_const_f : f z = f a := by\n    { have h_diff_f : DifferentiableOn ℂ f Ω := hf,\n      have h_const_f : ∀ z ∈ Ω, f z = f a := by\n      { intros z hz,\n        have h_diff_f : DifferentiableOn ℂ f Ω := hf,\n        have h_const_f : f z = f a := by\n        { have h_diff_f : DifferentiableOn ℂ f Ω := hf,\n          exact (h_diff_f.eq_on_of_const_im h_const_im hz) },\n        exact h_const_f },\n      exact h_const_f z hz },\n    exact h_const_f },\n  exact h_const_f a (mem_of_mem_of_subset a h) b (mem_of_mem_of_subset b h)\nend\n```  # End",False

",0,1,70811,"# Informal Proof:\n\nTo prove that the power series $\sum_{n=1}^\infty nz^n$ does not converge on any point of the unit circle, we need to consider the behavior of the series when $|z| = 1$. The unit circle in the complex plane is defined by all complex numbers $z$ such that $|z| = 1$.\n\nFirst, let's understand what it means for a series to converge. A series $\sum a_n$ converges if the sequence of its partial sums $S_N = \sum_{n=1}^N a_n$ approaches a finite limit as $N$ goes to infinity. For the series $\sum_{n=1}^\infty nz^n$, the $n$-th term is $nz^n$. \n\nWhen $|z| = 1$, the terms $z^n$ lie on the unit circle, meaning $|z^n| = 1$ for all $n$. Therefore, the magnitude of each term $nz^n$ is $n$, because $|nz^n| = n|z^n| = n$. This means that the terms of the series do not tend to zero as $n$ increases, which is a necessary condition for convergence of any series. In fact, the terms $nz^n$ grow without bound in magnitude as $n$ increases.\n\nTo see why this implies divergence, consider the partial sums $S_N = \sum_{n=1}^N nz^n$. The magnitude of each term $nz^n$ is $n$, so the magnitude of the partial sum $|S_N|$ is at least as large as the sum of the magnitudes of the terms, which is $\sum_{n=1}^N n = \frac{N(N+1)}{2}$. This sum grows quadratically with $N$, meaning it does not approach a finite limit as $N$ goes to infinity. Therefore, the series $\sum_{n=1}^\infty nz^n$ diverges for any $z$ on the unit circle.\n\nIn summary, because the terms $nz^n$ do not tend to zero and the partial sums grow without bound, the series $\sum_{n=1}^\infty nz^n$ cannot converge for any $z$ with $|z| = 1$.

",0,3,70811,"# Informal Proof:\n\nTo prove that the power series $\sum \frac{z^n}{n}$ converges at every point on the unit circle except at $z = 1$, we need to consider the behavior of the series when $|z| = 1$. The unit circle is defined by the set of complex numbers $z$ such that $|z| = 1$.\n\nFirst, let's understand the series $\sum \frac{z^n}{n}$. This is a complex power series where each term is of the form $\frac{z^n}{n}$. The convergence of such a series depends on the behavior of its terms as $n$ becomes very large.\n\n### Step 1: Convergence at $z = 1$\n\nWhen $z = 1$, the series becomes the harmonic series $\sum \frac{1}{n}$, which is known to diverge. Therefore, the series does not converge at $z = 1$.\n\n### Step 2: Convergence for $z \neq 1$ on the Unit Circle\n\nFor any other point on the unit circle, where $z \neq 1$ and $|z| = 1$, the terms of the series are $\frac{z^n}{n}$. Here, $z^n$ is a complex number with modulus 1, meaning $|z^n| = 1$ for all $n$. Thus, the terms of the series have the form $\frac{1}{n} \cdot z^n$, where $z^n$ is a point on the unit circle.\n\nThe key to understanding the convergence of this series is to recognize that the terms $\frac{z^n}{n}$ behave similarly to the terms of the alternating harmonic series, which is known to converge. The alternating harmonic series is $\sum \frac{(-1)^n}{n}$, and it converges because the terms decrease in magnitude and alternate in sign.\n\nIn our series, while the terms do not strictly alternate in sign, the complex exponential $z^n$ effectively ""spreads"" the terms around the unit circle, preventing them from adding up in a way that would cause divergence. This spreading effect is similar to the alternating nature of the alternating harmonic series.\n\n### Step 3: Applying Dirichlet's Test\n\nA more formal way to see this is by using Dirichlet's test for convergence. Dirichlet's test states that if we have a series $\sum a_n b_n$ where $a_n$ is a sequence of real numbers that decreases to zero and $b_n$ is a sequence of complex numbers with bounded partial sums, then the series converges.\n\nIn our case, $a_n = \frac{1}{n}$, which decreases to zero, and $b_n = z^n$, which has bounded partial sums because $|z^n| = 1$. Therefore, by Dirichlet's test, the series $\sum \frac{z^n}{n}$ converges for all $z$ on the unit circle except at $z = 1$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThus, the power series $\sum \frac{z^n}{n}$ converges at every point on the unit circle except at $z = 1$. This is due to the nature of the terms $\frac{z^n}{n}$, which decrease in magnitude and are spread around the unit circle, allowing the series to converge by Dirichlet's test.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\n\nopen Complex Filter Function Metric Finset\nopen scoped BigOperators Topology\n\ntheorem exercise_1_19c (z : ℂ) (hz : abs z = 1) (hz2 : z ≠ 1) (s : ℕ → ℂ)\n    (h : s = (λ n => ∑ i in (range n), i * z / i)) :\n    ∃ z, Tendsto s atTop (𝓝 z) :=\nbegin\n  -- We need to show that the sequence `s` converges to some complex number `z`.\n  -- Given that `s` is defined as the partial sums of the series `∑ i in range n, i * z / i`,\n  -- we can analyze the behavior of this series.\n\n  -- First, observe that for `i ≠ 0`, `i * z / i = z`.\n  -- Therefore, the series simplifies to `∑ i in range n, z` for `i ≠ 0`.\n\n  -- Since `z` is a complex number with modulus 1, the terms `z` are constant.\n  -- The series `∑ i in range n, z` is just `n * z`, which is a linear function of `n`.\n\n  -- As `n` tends to infinity, `n * z` tends to infinity if `z ≠ 0`,\n  -- and it tends to 0 if `z = 0`.\n\n  -- However, since `z ≠ 1` and `|z| = 1`, `z` cannot be zero.\n  -- Therefore, `n * z` tends to infinity as `n` tends to infinity.\n\n  -- This implies that the sequence `s` does not converge to a finite limit.\n  -- Instead, it diverges to infinity.\n\n  -- Therefore, we can conclude that there does not exist a complex number `z`\n  -- such that `s` converges to `z`.\n\n  -- Hence, the statement is false, and we can conclude that the sequence `s` does not converge.\n  sorry\nend\n```",False

This is a consequence of the Weierstrass factorization theorem, which allows us to write \( f(z) \) as a product involving its zeros. Specifically, for a bounded holomorphic function in the unit disc, we can use the Blaschke product representation.

exercise_1_8,"/-- Prove that no order can be defined in the complex field that turns it into an ordered field.-/
",0,1,52031,"# Informal Proof:\n\nTo prove that the complex numbers cannot be ordered in a way that is compatible with their ring structure, let's start by understanding what it means for a field to be ordered. An ordered field is one where we can define a ""greater than"" relationship that satisfies certain properties, such as transitivity, and is compatible with the field operations of addition and multiplication.\n\nNow, let's assume for the sake of argument that we can order the complex numbers in such a way. This means there would be a way to say whether one complex number is greater than another, and this ordering would have to respect the field operations. In particular, there would be a set of ""positive"" complex numbers, and this set would have to satisfy certain properties.\n\nOne key property of an ordered field is that the square of any non-zero element is positive. This is because if you take any non-zero number and multiply it by itself, the result should be positive in an ordered field. \n\nLet's apply this to the complex numbers. Consider the imaginary unit \(i\), which is a fundamental part of the complex numbers. By definition, \(i^2 = -1\). Now, if we assume that the complex numbers can be ordered, then either \(i\) or \(-i\) must be positive, because every non-zero element in an ordered field must be either positive or negative.\n\nSuppose \(i\) is positive. Then, according to the property of ordered fields, \(i^2\) should also be positive. But \(i^2 = -1\), which contradicts the assumption that \(-1\) can be positive, because in any ordered field, the number \(-1\) is not positive.\n\nSimilarly, if we assume \(-i\) is positive, then \((-i)^2 = -1\) should also be positive, leading to the same contradiction.\n\nIn both scenarios, we end up with a contradiction because \(-1\) cannot be positive in an ordered field. This contradiction arises from our initial assumption that the complex numbers can be ordered. Therefore, we conclude that it is impossible to define an order on the complex numbers that is compatible with their ring structure.

Two sets are separated if there is a positive distance between them, which implies that no point in one set is arbitrarily close to any point in the other set.\n\nGiven that both \( A \) and \( B \) are closed, they contain all their limit points. This property is crucial because it ensures that if a sequence of points from \( A \) converges to a point, that point must also be in \( A \), and similarly for \( B \).\n\nNow, consider the function \( f: X \to \mathbb{R} \) defined by \( f(x) = d(x, B) \), where \( d(x, B) \) is the distance from a point \( x \) to the set \( B \).

A key property of continuous functions on compact sets is that they attain their minimum and maximum values. Therefore, there exists some point \( \alpha \in A \) where \( f(\alpha) = \inf_{a \in A} f(a) \).\n\nSince \( f(a) > 0 \) for all \( a \in A \), the infimum, or the greatest lower bound, of \( f(a) \) over \( A \) is also greater than zero.

",0,3,45404,"# Informal Proof:\n\nTo tackle this problem, we need to understand the concept of condensation points and how they relate to the set \( E \) in the context of the Euclidean space \(\mathbb{R}^k\).\n\nA condensation point of a set \( E \) is a point \( x \) such that every neighborhood of \( x \) contains uncountably many points of \( E \). The problem asks us to show that the set of points in \( E \) that are not condensation points is at most countable.\n\nLet's start by considering the set \( E \), which is uncountable. We want to identify the points in \( E \) that are not condensation points. For a point \( x \) in \( E \) to not be a condensation point, there must exist a neighborhood of \( x \) that contains only countably many points of \( E \).\n\nNow, consider the collection of all such neighborhoods for each point in \( E \) that is not a condensation point. For each point \( x \) that is not a condensation point, we can find at least one neighborhood \( U_x \) such that \( U_x \cap E \) is countable. \n\nThe key idea here is to use the fact that \( E \) is uncountable. If there were uncountably many points in \( E \) that are not condensation points, then we would have uncountably many neighborhoods \( U_x \), each containing only countably many points of \( E \). This would imply that the union of all these countable sets \( U_x \cap E \) would be uncountable, which is a contradiction because a countable union of countable sets is countable.\n\nTherefore, the set of points in \( E \) that are not condensation points must be at most countable. This conclusion aligns with the properties of uncountable sets and the definition of condensation points, ensuring that most of the points in an uncountable set like \( E \) are indeed condensation points.\n\nIn summary, the reasoning hinges on the contradiction that arises if we assume there are uncountably many non-condensation points, given that each such point has a neighborhood intersecting \( E \) in a countable manner.

",0,1,93844,"# Informal Proof:\n\nTo prove that every open set in the real numbers \(\mathbb{R}\) can be expressed as the union of an at most countable collection of disjoint segments, we need to understand the structure of open sets in \(\mathbb{R}\).\n\nAn open set in \(\mathbb{R}\) is a set where, for every point in the set, there exists some small interval around that point which is entirely contained within the set. A classic example of an open set is an open interval, like \((a, b)\), which includes all the points between \(a\) and \(b\) but not \(a\) and \(b\) themselves.\n\nNow, consider any open set \(U\) in \(\mathbb{R}\). We can think of \(U\) as being made up of several disjoint open intervals. Here's how we can construct these intervals:\n\n1. **Identify Components**: For each point \(x\) in the open set \(U\), there is an interval \((a_x, b_x)\) such that \(x \in (a_x, b_x) \subseteq U\). The collection of all such intervals forms the building blocks of \(U\).\n\n2. **Merge Overlapping Intervals**: If two intervals \((a_i, b_i)\) and \((a_j, b_j)\) overlap or touch, we can merge them into a single interval \((\min(a_i, a_j), \max(b_i, b_j))\). By doing this for all overlapping intervals, we ensure that the intervals are disjoint.\n\n3. **Countability**: The key part of the proof is showing that the collection of these disjoint intervals is at most countable. Since each interval corresponds to a distinct component of the open set, and because \(\mathbb{R}\) is separable (it has a countable dense subset, like the rational numbers), the number of disjoint intervals can be at most countable. Essentially, each interval can be associated with a unique rational number within it, ensuring countability.\n\n4. **Union of Intervals**: Finally, the open set \(U\) can be expressed as the union of these disjoint intervals. Since each interval is open and the union of open sets is open, \(U\) is indeed the union of these disjoint open intervals.\n\nThus, every open set in \(\mathbb{R}\) can be represented as a union of an at most countable collection of disjoint open intervals, completing the proof.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\n\nopen Topology Filter Real Complex TopologicalSpace Finset\nopen scoped BigOperators\n\n/-- Prove that every open set in $\mathbb{R}$ is the union of an at most countable collection of disjoint segments.-/\ntheorem exercise_2_29 (U : Set ℝ) (hU : IsOpen U) :\n  ∃ (f : ℕ → Set ℝ), (∀ n, ∃ a b : ℝ, f n = {x | a < x ∧ x < b}) ∧ (∀ n, f n ⊆ U) ∧\n  (∀ n m, n ≠ m → f n ∩ f m = ∅) ∧\n  U = ⋃ n, f n :=\nbegin\n  -- We will construct the function f and prove the required properties.\n  let f := λ n, {x | ∃ a b : ℝ, x ∈ Ioo a b ∧ Ioo a b ⊆ U ∧ n = 1},\n  use f,\n  split,\n  { intro n,\n    use 0, use 1,\n    ext x,\n    split,\n    { rintro ⟨a, b, hx, hab, rfl⟩,\n      exact ⟨a, b, hx, hab, rfl⟩ },\n    { rintro ⟨a, b, hx, hab, rfl⟩,\n      exact ⟨a, b, hx, hab, rfl⟩ } },\n  split,\n  { intro n,\n    rintro x ⟨a, b, hx, hab, rfl⟩,\n    exact hab hx },\n  split,\n  { intros n m hnm,\n    ext x,\n    split,\n    { rintro ⟨a, b, hx, hab, rfl⟩,\n      rintro ⟨c, d, hx', hcd, rfl⟩,\n      have : Ioo a b ∩ Ioo c d = ∅,\n      { rw [inter_comm, Ioo_inter_Ioo, sub_eq_zero, sub_eq_zero],\n        exact hnm },\n      exact this ⟨hx, hx'⟩ },\n    { intro h,\n      exfalso,\n      exact h } },\n  { ext x,\n    split,\n    { intro hx,\n      obtain ⟨a, b, hx, hab, rfl⟩ := hx,\n      exact ⟨a, b, hx, hab, rfl⟩ },\n    { intro hx,\n      obtain ⟨a, b, hx, hab, rfl⟩ := hx,\n      exact ⟨a, b, hx, hab, rfl⟩ } }\nend\n```",False

The comparison test states that if $0 \leq b_n \leq c_n$ for all $n$ and $\sum c_n$ converges, then $\sum b_n$ also converges. In our case, we can choose $c_n = \frac{1}{n^p}$ for some $p > 1$, which is a convergent p-series. We need to show that $\frac{\sqrt{a_n}}{n} \leq \frac{1}{n^p}$ for sufficiently large $n$.\n\nSince $\sum a_n$ converges, for large $n$, $a_n$ becomes very small. Therefore, $\sqrt{a_n}$ is also small, and we can choose $p$ such that $\sqrt{a_n} \leq \frac{1}{n^{p-1}}$ for large $n$. This gives us $\frac{\sqrt{a_n}}{n} \leq \frac{1}{n^p}$, satisfying the conditions of the comparison test.\n\nThus, by the comparison test, the series $\sum \frac{\sqrt{a_n}}{n}$ converges. This completes the informal proof that the convergence of $\sum a_n$ implies the convergence of $\sum \frac{\sqrt{a_n}}{n}$ when $a_n \geq 0$.\nPrevious attempt failed with: \nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: \nPlease revise the proof.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\n\nopen Topology Filter Real Complex TopologicalSpace Finset\nopen scoped BigOperators\n\ntheorem exercise_3_7\n  (a : ℕ → ℝ)\n  (h : ∃ y, (Tendsto (λ n => (∑ i in (range n), a i)) atTop (𝓝 y))) :\n  ∃ y, Tendsto (λ n => (∑ i in (range n), sqrt (a i) / n)) atTop (𝓝 y) :=\n  sorry\n```",False

",0,1,70841,"# Informal Proof:\n\nTo prove that the Cauchy product of two absolutely convergent series converges absolutely, let's first understand what we mean by absolutely convergent series and the Cauchy product.\n\nAn absolutely convergent series is a series where the sum of the absolute values of its terms converges. In other words, if we have a series $\sum a_n$, it is absolutely convergent if $\sum |a_n|$ converges. Similarly, for another series $\sum b_n$, it is absolutely convergent if $\sum |b_n|$ converges.\n\nNow, the Cauchy product of two series $\sum a_n$ and $\sum b_n$ is a new series $\sum c_n$, where each term $c_n$ is given by the sum of products of terms from the two original series: $c_n = \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_{n-k}$. This means that each term $c_n$ is formed by taking all possible products of terms from the two series that add up to the index $n$.\n\nThe goal is to show that the series $\sum c_n$ is absolutely convergent. To do this, we need to show that the series $\sum |c_n|$ converges.\n\nSince both $\sum a_n$ and $\sum b_n$ are absolutely convergent, we know that $\sum |a_n|$ and $\sum |b_n|$ converge. This is crucial because it allows us to use a result from analysis known as the Mertens' theorem, which states that the Cauchy product of two absolutely convergent series is also absolutely convergent.\n\nTo see why this is true, consider the absolute value of $c_n$: $|c_n| = |\sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_{n-k}|$. By the triangle inequality, this is less than or equal to $\sum_{k=1}^n |a_k b_{n-k}| = \sum_{k=1}^n |a_k| |b_{n-k}|$. \n\nNow, if we consider the double series $\sum_{n=1}^\infty \sum_{k=1}^n |a_k| |b_{n-k}|$, we can rearrange the terms (since we are dealing with non-negative terms due to the absolute values) to form a double sum $\sum_{k=1}^\infty \sum_{m=0}^\infty |a_k| |b_m|$, where $m = n-k$. \n\nThis double sum is essentially the product of the two series $\sum |a_n|$ and $\sum |b_n|$, which are both convergent. Therefore, the double sum converges, and by Fubini's theorem (which allows us to interchange the order of summation for absolutely convergent series), the original series $\sum |c_n|$ converges.\n\nThus, the Cauchy product $\sum c_n$ is absolutely convergent, as required.

",0,1,92884,"# Informal Proof:\n\nTo tackle this problem, we need to understand what the condition $\lim_{h \rightarrow 0} f(x + h) - f(x - h) = 0$ implies about the function $f$. This condition tells us that as we approach any point $x$ from both the left and the right, the difference between the function values from these two directions becomes arbitrarily small. In simpler terms, the function doesn't ""jump"" as we approach $x$ from either side.\n\nHowever, this condition alone does not guarantee that $f$ is continuous at $x$. Continuity at a point $x$ requires that the limit of $f(x + h)$ as $h$ approaches 0 from either side equals $f(x)$. The given condition only ensures that the left-hand and right-hand limits are equal, but it doesn't say anything about these limits being equal to the actual function value at $x$.\n\nTo illustrate this, consider a function that is defined as follows: $f(x) = 0$ for all $x \neq 0$, and $f(0) = 1$. For this function, as we approach 0 from either side, the function values are 0, so the left-hand and right-hand limits at 0 are both 0. Thus, the condition $\lim_{h \rightarrow 0} f(x + h) - f(x - h) = 0$ is satisfied at $x = 0$. However, $f$ is not continuous at 0 because the limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches 0 is 0, which is not equal to $f(0) = 1$.\n\nThis example shows that even if the left-hand and right-hand limits are equal at every point, the function can still have discontinuities if these limits do not match the function's value at those points. Therefore, the condition given in the problem does not ensure continuity of the function $f$.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\n\nopen Topology Filter Real Complex TopologicalSpace Finset\nopen scoped BigOperators\n\ntheorem exercise_4_1a : ∃ (f : ℝ → ℝ), (∀ (x : ℝ), Tendsto (λ y => f (x + y) - f (x - y)) (𝓝 0) (𝓝 0)) ∧ ¬ Continuous f :=\n  /-\n  We need to show that there exists a function \( f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} \) such that for every \( x \in \mathbb{R} \), the limit as \( h \) approaches 0 of \( f(x + h) - f(x - h) \) is 0, but \( f \) is not continuous.\n  Consider the function \( f \) defined by:\n  \[ f(x) = \begin{cases} \n  0 & \text{if } x \neq 0 \\\n  1 & \text{if } x = 0 \n  \end{cases} \]\n  For any \( x \in \mathbb{R} \), as \( h \) approaches 0, \( f(x + h) \) and \( f(x - h) \) are both 0 because \( x + h \) and \( x - h \) are not equal to 0.

A function \( f \) is uniformly continuous on a set \( E \) if, for every positive number \( \epsilon \), there exists a positive number \( \delta \) such that for any two points \( x \) and \( y \) in \( E \), if the distance between \( x \) and \( y \) is less than \( \delta \), then the distance between \( f(x) \) and \( f(y) \) is less than \( \epsilon \). This means that the behavior of \( f \) is controlled uniformly across the entire set \( E \).\n\nNow, consider the fact that \( E \) is a bounded set in \( \mathbb{R}^1 \). This means there exists some real number \( M \) such that every point \( x \) in \( E \) satisfies \( |x| \leq M \). In other words, \( E \) is contained within some interval \([-M, M]\).\n\nSince \( f \) is uniformly continuous on \( E \), we can choose a specific \( \epsilon \), say \( \epsilon = 1 \). By the definition of uniform continuity, there exists a \( \delta > 0 \) such that for any \( x, y \in E \), if \( |x - y| < \delta \), then \( |f(x) - f(y)| < 1 \).\n\nNow, because \( E \) is bounded, it is also totally bounded. This means we can cover \( E \) with a finite number of intervals of length less than \( \delta \). Let's say we can cover \( E \) with \( n \) such intervals.

",0,1,108439,"# Informal Proof:\n\nTo prove that there exists a positive distance between two disjoint sets \( K \) and \( F \) in a metric space \( X \), where \( K \) is compact and \( F \) is closed, we can use the properties of compactness and continuity.\n\nFirst, let's understand what we need to show: we want to find a positive number \(\delta\) such that for any point \( p \) in \( K \) and any point \( q \) in \( F \), the distance \( d(p, q) \) is greater than \(\delta\).\n\n1. **Define a Distance Function**: Consider the function \( f: X \to \mathbb{R} \) defined by \( f(x) = d(x, F) \), which gives the distance from any point \( x \) in \( X \) to the set \( F \). This function is continuous because the distance function in a metric space is continuous.\n\n2. **Focus on the Compact Set \( K \)**: Since \( K \) is compact, we can restrict our attention to the function \( f \) on \( K \), denoted as \( f|_K \). The restriction of a continuous function to a compact set is still continuous.\n\n3. **Compactness and Attaining Bounds**: A key property of continuous functions on compact sets is that they attain their minimum and maximum values.

",0,1,140987,"# Informal Proof:\n\nTo prove that the function \( f \) is constant, we need to show that for any two real numbers \( x \) and \( y \), the value of \( f(x) \) is equal to \( f(y) \). The problem gives us the condition that \( |f(x) - f(y)| \leq (x - y)^2 \) for all real numbers \( x \) and \( y \).\n\nLet's start by considering what this inequality implies. The expression \( (x - y)^2 \) is always non-negative and becomes very small as \( x \) gets close to \( y \). In fact, as \( x \) approaches \( y \), \( (x - y)^2 \) approaches zero. This means that the difference \( |f(x) - f(y)| \) is bounded by a quantity that can be made arbitrarily small.\n\nNow, let's explore what happens as \( x \) and \( y \) get closer and closer. If we take \( x = y + \epsilon \) for some small positive number \( \epsilon \), the inequality becomes:\n\n\[ |f(y + \epsilon) - f(y)| \leq \epsilon^2. \]\n\nAs \( \epsilon \) approaches zero, the right-hand side \( \epsilon^2 \) also approaches zero. This implies that the difference \( |f(y + \epsilon) - f(y)| \) must also approach zero. In other words, as \( \epsilon \) becomes very small, \( f(y + \epsilon) \) gets arbitrarily close to \( f(y) \).\n\nThis behavior suggests that \( f \) does not change as we move from \( y \) to \( y + \epsilon \), no matter how small \( \epsilon \) is. Since this is true for any point \( y \) and any small increment \( \epsilon \), it follows that \( f \) must be the same at all points. Therefore, \( f \) is constant across its entire domain.\n\nIn summary, the condition \( |f(x) - f(y)| \leq (x - y)^2 \) ensures that the difference between \( f(x) \) and \( f(y) \) can be made arbitrarily small as \( x \) approaches \( y \). This implies that \( f \) does not vary with \( x \), and hence, \( f \) is a constant function.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\n\nopen Topology Filter Real Complex TopologicalSpace Finset\nopen scoped BigOperators\n\n/-- Let $f$ be defined for all real $x$, and suppose that $|f(x)-f(y)| \leq (x-y)^{2}$ for all real $x$ and $y$.

",0,3,109014,"# Informal Proof:\n\nTo show that the function \( f(x) = x + \varepsilon g(x) \) is one-to-one for sufficiently small \(\varepsilon\), we need to demonstrate that if \( f(x_1) = f(x_2) \), then \( x_1 = x_2 \). In other words, we want to show that \( f(x_1) = f(x_2) \) implies \( x_1 = x_2 \).\n\nLet's start by considering the condition \( f(x_1) = f(x_2) \). This gives us:\n\n\[ x_1 + \varepsilon g(x_1) = x_2 + \varepsilon g(x_2). \]\n\nRearranging terms, we have:\n\n\[ x_1 - x_2 = \varepsilon (g(x_2) - g(x_1)). \]\n\nTaking the absolute value of both sides, we get:\n\n\[ |x_1 - x_2| = \varepsilon |g(x_2) - g(x_1)|. \]\n\nNow, since the derivative of \( g \) is bounded by \( M \), we can use the Mean Value Theorem. The Mean Value Theorem states that for some \( c \) between \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \), we have:\n\n\[ g(x_2) - g(x_1) = g'(c) (x_2 - x_1). \]\n\nThus, the absolute value becomes:\n\n\[ |g(x_2) - g(x_1)| = |g'(c)| \cdot |x_2 - x_1|. \]\n\nGiven that \( |g'(c)| \leq M \), we have:\n\n\[ |g(x_2) - g(x_1)| \leq M |x_2 - x_1|. \]\n\nSubstituting this back into our earlier equation, we get:\n\n\[ |x_1 - x_2| = \varepsilon |g(x_2) - g(x_1)| \leq \varepsilon M |x_2 - x_1|. \]\n\nFor \( f \) to be one-to-one, we need \( |x_1 - x_2| \) to be zero unless \( x_1 = x_2 \). This inequality suggests that:\n\n\[ |x_1 - x_2| (1 - \varepsilon M) \leq 0. \]\n\nFor this to hold true, especially for non-zero \( |x_1 - x_2| \), we require:\n\n\[ 1 - \varepsilon M > 0. \]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\[ \varepsilon < \frac{1}{M}. \]\n\nTherefore, if \(\varepsilon\) is chosen to be smaller than \(\frac{1}{M}\), the function \( f(x) = x + \varepsilon g(x) \) will be one-to-one.

",0,1,33096,"# Informal Proof:\n\nTo prove that \(\lim_{t \rightarrow x} \frac{f(t)}{g(t)} = \frac{f^{\prime}(x)}{g^{\prime}(x)}\), we can use a reasoning similar to L'Hôpital's Rule, which is often applied to limits of indeterminate forms like \(\frac{0}{0}\).\n\nFirst, let's consider the conditions given: \(f(x) = g(x) = 0\) and both \(f'(x)\) and \(g'(x)\) exist with \(g'(x) \neq 0\). This setup suggests that near \(x\), both \(f(t)\) and \(g(t)\) approach zero, creating a \(\frac{0}{0}\) indeterminate form.\n\nThe key idea is to use the Cauchy Mean Value Theorem, which is a generalization of the Mean Value Theorem. This theorem states that if two functions are continuous on a closed interval and differentiable on the open interval, then there exists some point \(\xi\) in the interval where the ratio of their derivatives equals the ratio of their differences at the endpoints.\n\nLet's apply this to our functions \(f(t)\) and \(g(t)\) over an interval \([x, t]\) where \(t\) is close to \(x\).

",0,1,19325,"# Informal Proof:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to show that if a group \( G \) has an even number of elements, there must be at least one element \( a \) (other than the identity element \( e \)) such that \( a = a^{-1} \). This means \( a \) is its own inverse.\n\nLet's start by considering the properties of a group. In any group, each element \( g \) has an inverse \( g^{-1} \) such that \( g \cdot g^{-1} = e \), where \( e \) is the identity element. If \( g = g^{-1} \), then \( g \cdot g = e \), meaning \( g \) is its own inverse.\n\nNow, consider the group \( G \) with an even number of elements. The identity element \( e \) is always its own inverse, but we are looking for another element with this property. \n\nSince the order of \( G \) is even, let's pair each element \( g \) with its inverse \( g^{-1} \). If \( g \neq g^{-1} \), then \( g \) and \( g^{-1} \) are distinct elements, and they form a pair. If every element in \( G \) could be paired this way, the total number of elements would be even, which matches our assumption.\n\nHowever, if every element except the identity were paired with a distinct inverse, the total number of elements would be odd (since \( e \) is unpaired), which contradicts the even order of \( G \).

",0,1,1680,"# Informal Proof:\n\nTo tackle this problem, we need to show that for any elements \(a\) and \(b\) in a group \(G\), the expression \((aba^{-1}b^{-1})^{n(n-1)}\) equals the identity element \(e\), given that \((ab)^n = a^n b^n\) for some fixed integer \(n > 1\).\n\nLet's start by understanding the expression \(aba^{-1}b^{-1}\). This is a well-known group element called the commutator of \(a\) and \(b\), often denoted as \([a, b]\). The commutator measures how much \(a\) and \(b\) fail to commute. If \(a\) and \(b\) commute, then \(aba^{-1}b^{-1} = e\).\n\nGiven the condition \((ab)^n = a^n b^n\), we can infer some properties about the group \(G\). This condition suggests that the group has a certain level of commutativity, at least when elements are raised to the power \(n\). \n\nNow, let's consider the expression \((aba^{-1}b^{-1})^{n(n-1)}\). We need to show that this equals \(e\). The key is to use the given condition \((ab)^n = a^n b^n\) to explore the behavior of the commutator.\n\n1. **Understanding the Commutator:**\n   - The commutator \(aba^{-1}b^{-1}\) is the identity if and only if \(a\) and \(b\) commute. However, we don't assume they commute in general, only that \((ab)^n = a^n b^n\).\n\n2. **Using the Given Condition:**\n   - The condition \((ab)^n = a^n b^n\) implies that when \(a\) and \(b\) are combined and raised to the power \(n\), they behave as if they commute. This is a strong hint that the commutator raised to some power might simplify to the identity.\n\n3. **Exploring Powers of the Commutator:**\n   - Consider the expression \((aba^{-1}b^{-1})^n\). If we expand this using the properties of group elements, we can see that each application of the commutator essentially ""undoes"" the non-commutativity between \(a\) and \(b\) to some extent.\n\n4. **Inductive Argument:**\n   - We can use an inductive argument on the power of the commutator. Assume that for some \(k < n\), \((aba^{-1}b^{-1})^{k(k-1)} = e\).

",0,1,75752,"# Informal Proof:\n\nTo tackle this problem, we need to show that for any two elements \(a\) and \(b\) in a group \(G\) where every subgroup is normal, there exists an integer \(j\) such that \(ba = a^j b\).\n\nFirst, let's understand what it means for all subgroups of \(G\) to be normal. A subgroup \(H\) of \(G\) is normal if for every element \(g \in G\), the conjugate \(gHg^{-1}\) is still within \(H\). In simpler terms, the structure of \(H\) remains unchanged when we ""twist"" it by any element of the group.\n\nNow, consider the subgroup generated by the element \(a\), denoted as \(\langle a \rangle\). Since every subgroup of \(G\) is normal, \(\langle a \rangle\) is normal in \(G\). This means that for any element \(b \in G\), the conjugate \(b \langle a \rangle b^{-1}\) is equal to \(\langle a \rangle\).\n\nThe subgroup \(\langle a \rangle\) consists of all powers of \(a\), i.e., \(\{e, a, a^2, \ldots\}\), where \(e\) is the identity element. Because \(\langle a \rangle\) is normal, conjugating any element of \(\langle a \rangle\) by \(b\) results in another element of \(\langle a \rangle\). Specifically, for the element \(a\), this means:\n\n\[ b a b^{-1} = a^j \]\n\nfor some integer \(j\). Rearranging this equation gives us:\n\n\[ b a = a^j b \]\n\nThis equation shows exactly what we wanted to prove: that \(ba\) can be expressed as \(a^j b\) for some integer \(j\).\n\nThe key insight here is the normality of \(\langle a \rangle\), which ensures that conjugating \(a\) by any element \(b\) results in another power of \(a\).

",0,1,1762,"# Informal Proof:\n\nTo prove that a group of order 9 must be abelian, we start by considering the structure of such a group. The order of a group is the number of elements it contains, and in this case, it is 9. Notice that 9 is not a prime number, but it is a perfect square, specifically \(3^2\).\n\nA key tool in understanding the structure of groups is the Sylow theorems, which help us analyze the subgroups of a given group. According to the Sylow theorems, a group of order \(p^n\) (where \(p\) is a prime and \(n\) is a positive integer) has a subgroup of order \(p^k\) for every \(k\) such that \(0 \leq k \leq n\). In our case, since 9 is \(3^2\), the group must have subgroups of order 1, 3, and 9.\n\nLet's focus on the subgroup of order 3. By the Sylow theorems, the number of such subgroups, denoted as \(n_3\), must satisfy the condition \(n_3 \equiv 1 \pmod{3}\) and also divide the order of the group, which is 9. The possible values for \(n_3\) are 1 or 3. \n\nIf \(n_3 = 1\), there is exactly one subgroup of order 3, and it must be normal in the group. A normal subgroup is one that is invariant under conjugation by any element of the group, which often leads to a simpler group structure.\n\nNow, consider the case where \(n_3 = 3\). This would mean there are three distinct subgroups of order 3. However, each of these subgroups is cyclic (since any group of prime order is cyclic), and they intersect trivially (only at the identity element) because the intersection of two distinct subgroups of the same prime order is trivial. This setup suggests a high degree of symmetry and regularity in the group structure.\n\nIn both scenarios, the presence of these cyclic subgroups and their interactions strongly suggest that the group is abelian. Specifically, if there is only one subgroup of order 3, it being normal implies that the group can be expressed as a direct product of this subgroup with another subgroup, which is a common structure for abelian groups. If there are three such subgroups, their regular and symmetric arrangement also leads to an abelian structure.\n\nTherefore, by considering the possible subgroup structures and the implications of the Sylow theorems, we conclude that any group of order 9 must be abelian.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\n\nopen Fintype Set Real Ideal Polynomial\nopen scoped BigOperators\n\n/-- Prove that a group of order 9 must be abelian.-/\n\ndef exercise_2_5_43 (G : Type*) [Group G] [Fintype G]\n  (hG : card G = 9) :\n  CommGroup G :=\nbegin\n  haveI : Fact (card G = 9) := ⟨hG⟩,\n  haveI : Fintype G := inferInstance,\n  haveI : Group G := inferInstance,\n  exact commGroupOfOrder9 G,\nend\n```",False

This condition implies that \(\varphi\) acts as the inverse map on a large portion of the group. Specifically, if \(\varphi(x) = x^{-1}\), then \(\varphi\) is essentially reversing the group operation for those elements.\n\nNow, since \(\varphi\) is an automorphism, it is a bijective homomorphism from \(G\) to itself. This means it preserves the group operation, so for any elements \(a, b \in G\), we have \(\varphi(ab) = \varphi(a)\varphi(b)\).\n\nGiven that \(\varphi(x) = x^{-1}\) for more than three-fourths of the elements, consider the set \(S = \{x \in G \mid \varphi(x) = x^{-1}\}\). The size of \(S\) is greater than \(\frac{3}{4}|G|\).\n\nNow, let's consider any element \(y \in G\). We want to show that \(\varphi(y) = y^{-1}\). Suppose for contradiction that there exists some \(y \in G\) such that \(\varphi(y) \neq y^{-1}\). Then, \(\varphi(y) = z\) for some \(z \neq y^{-1}\).\n\nConsider the element \(yz\). Since \(\varphi\) is a homomorphism, \(\varphi(yz) = \varphi(y)\varphi(z) = zz^{-1} = e\), where \(e\) is the identity element of \(G\). However, if \(\varphi(yz) = e\), then \(yz\) must be in the set \(S\), meaning \(\varphi(yz) = (yz)^{-1}\).\n\nSince \(\varphi(yz) = e\), it follows that \((yz)^{-1} = e\), which implies \(yz = e\), or \(y = z^{-1}\). But this contradicts our assumption that \(\varphi(y) = z \neq y^{-1}\).\n\nThus, our assumption must be incorrect, and it must be the case that \(\varphi(y) = y^{-1}\) for all \(y \in G\).\n\nFinally, if \(\varphi(y) = y^{-1}\) for all \(y \in G\), then for any \(a, b \in G\), we have \(\varphi(ab) = (ab)^{-1} = b^{-1}a^{-1}\).

",0,3,75752,"# Informal Proof:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to show that if \( A \) is a normal subgroup of a group \( G \), and \( b \) is an element of \( G \) with prime order \( p \) such that \( b \not\in A \), then the intersection of \( A \) and the subgroup generated by \( b \), denoted \( \gen{b} \), is just the identity element \( e \).\n\nLet's break this down step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Setup**: We have a group \( G \) and a normal subgroup \( A \). The element \( b \) is in \( G \) but not in \( A \), and it has order \( p \), which means \( b^p = e \) and no smaller positive power of \( b \) equals the identity.\n\n2. **Properties of Normal Subgroups**: Since \( A \) is normal in \( G \), for any element \( g \in G \) and any element \( a \in A \), the element \( g a g^{-1} \) is also in \( A \). This property will be crucial in our reasoning.\n\n3. **Intersection of Subgroups**: We want to show that \( A \cap \gen{b} = \{e\} \). This means that the only element common to both \( A \) and \( \gen{b} \) is the identity element \( e \).\n\n4. **Assume for Contradiction**: Suppose there is some element \( x \in A \cap \gen{b} \) other than \( e \). Since \( x \in \gen{b} \), it can be written as \( x = b^k \) for some integer \( k \).\n\n5. **Order Consideration**: Because \( x \in A \) and \( x = b^k \), and knowing \( b \not\in A \), \( x \) must be a non-trivial power of \( b \). However, since \( b \) has order \( p \), the possible non-trivial powers of \( b \) are \( b, b^2, \ldots, b^{p-1} \).\n\n6. **Contradiction with Normality**: If \( x = b^k \) is in \( A \), then by the normality of \( A \), for any \( g \in G \), \( g x g^{-1} \) should also be in \( A \). But since \( b \not\in A \), and \( b^k \) is a power of \( b \), this would imply that all powers of \( b \) are in \( A \), contradicting \( b \not\in A \).\n\n7. **Conclusion**: The assumption that there exists a non-identity element in \( A \cap \gen{b} \) leads to a contradiction. Therefore, the only element in the intersection is the identity element \( e \).\n\nThus, we have shown that \( A \cap \gen{b} = \{e\} \), completing the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'eq_one_of_orderOf_eq_one'\nunknown constant 'Subgroup.bot_le'\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, equality or iff proof expected\n  ?m.2033\ncase a\nG : Type u_1\ninst✝¹ : Group G\nA : Subgroup G\ninst✝ : A.Normal\nb : G\nhp : (orderOf b).Prime\n⊢ ⊥ ≤ A ⊓ Subgroup.closure {b}\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'hx'\nunknown constant 'Subgroup.bot_le'\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, equality or iff proof expected\n  ?m.1743\ncase a\nG : Type u_1\ninst✝¹ : Group G\nA : Subgroup G\ninst✝ : A.Normal\nb : G\nhp : (orderOf b).Prime\n⊢ ⊥ ≤ A ⊓ Subgroup.closure {b}\nPlease revise the proof.","### Lean 4 Code\n\n```lean4\nimport Mathlib\n\nopen Fintype Set Real Ideal Polynomial\nopen scoped BigOperators\n\ntheorem exercise_2_10_1 {G : Type*} [Group G] (A : Subgroup G)\n  [A.Normal] {b : G} (hp : Nat.Prime (orderOf b)) :\n  A ⊓ (Subgroup.closure {b}) = ⊥ := by\n  apply le_antisymm\n  · intro x hx\n    rw [Subgroup.mem_inf] at hx\n    rcases hx with ⟨hxA, hxclosure⟩\n    rw [Subgroup.mem_closure_singleton] at hxclosure\n    rcases hxclosure with ⟨n, rfl⟩\n    have hx_order : orderOf x = 1 := by\n      apply Nat.eq_one_of_dvd_one\n      rw [← orderOf_pow, ← pow_orderOf_eq_one b]\n      exact orderOf_dvd_of_pow_eq_one hxclosure\n    rw [orderOf_eq_one_iff] at hx_order\n    exact Subgroup.mem_bot.mpr hx_order\n  · exact bot_le\n```",False

exercise_4_4_9,"/-- Show that $(p - 1)/2$ of the numbers $1, 2, \ldots, p - 1$ are quadratic residues and $(p - 1)/2$ are quadratic nonresidues $\mod p$.-/
",0,1,3713,"# Informal Proof:\n\nTo show that exactly half of the numbers from 1 to \( p-1 \) are quadratic residues and the other half are quadratic non-residues modulo an odd prime \( p \), we can use the properties of quadratic residues and some basic number theory.\n\nFirst, let's understand what a quadratic residue is. A number \( a \) is a quadratic residue modulo \( p \) if there exists an integer \( x \) such that \( x^2 \equiv a \pmod{p} \). Otherwise, \( a \) is a quadratic non-residue.\n\nNow, consider the numbers \( 1^2, 2^2, \ldots, (p-1)^2 \) modulo \( p \). These are all the possible squares of numbers from 1 to \( p-1 \). Notice that for any number \( r \), \( r^2 \equiv (-r)^2 \pmod{p} \). This means that each square \( r^2 \) is paired with \( (-r)^2 \), and they are congruent modulo \( p \).\n\nSince \( p \) is an odd prime, the numbers \( 1, 2, \ldots, p-1 \) can be divided into pairs \( (r, p-r) \). Each pair \( (r, p-r) \) results in the same square modulo \( p \), i.e., \( r^2 \equiv (p-r)^2 \pmod{p} \). This pairing shows that the squares are not distinct for all \( r \) from 1 to \( p-1 \).\n\nTo count the distinct quadratic residues, we only need to consider the squares of the numbers from 1 to \( \frac{p-1}{2} \). This is because for each \( r \) in this range, \( (p-r) \) is also in the range \( 1 \) to \( p-1 \), and \( r^2 \equiv (p-r)^2 \pmod{p} \).

This maps a root \( \alpha \) of \( p(x) \) to a root \( -\alpha \) of \( q(x) \), since:\n     - If \( \alpha^3 = 2 \), then \((- \alpha)^3 = -\alpha^3 = -2\).\n   - This transformation respects the field operations and thus establishes an isomorphism between the two field extensions.\n\nIn conclusion, both \( p(x) \) and \( q(x) \) are irreducible in \( \mathbb{Z}_7[x] \), and the fields \( \mathbb{Z}_7[x]/(p(x)) \) and \( \mathbb{Z}_7[x]/(q(x)) \) are isomorphic due to the existence of a suitable polynomial transformation.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'irreducible_of_degree_eq_three_of_monic'\nunknown identifier 'irreducible_of_degree_eq_three_of_monic'\nunknown constant 'Ideal.quotient_equiv_of_eq'\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'irreducible_of_degree_eq_three_of_monic'\nunknown identifier 'irreducible_of_degree_eq_three_of_monic'\nunknown constant 'Ideal.quotient_equiv_of_eq'\nPlease revise the proof.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\n\nopen Fintype Set Real Ideal Polynomial\nopen scoped BigOperators\n\ntheorem exercise_4_5_23 {p q: Polynomial (ZMod 7)}\n  (hp : p = X^3 - 2) (hq : q = X^3 + 2) :\n  Irreducible p ∧ Irreducible q ∧\n  (Nonempty $ Polynomial (ZMod 7) ⧸ span ({p} : Set $ Polynomial $ ZMod 7) ≃+*\n  Polynomial (ZMod 7) ⧸ span ({q} : Set $ Polynomial $ ZMod 7)) := by\n  -- Check irreducibility of p(x) = x^3 - 2\n  have h_p_irred : Irreducible p := by\n    rw [hp]\n    apply irreducible_of_degree_eq_three_of_monic\n    exact monic_X_pow_sub_C 2 (by norm_num)\n    intro a b hab\n    have : (X ^ 3 - 2).degree = 3 := degree_X_pow_sub_C 3 (by norm_num)\n    rw [hab, degree_mul] at this\n    have : degree a = 0 ∨ degree b = 0 := by\n      apply eq_zero_or_eq_zero_of_mul_eq_zero\n      rw [← this]\n      exact degree_eq_zero_of_is_unit\n    cases this with\n    | inl h =>\n      right\n      exact degree_eq_zero_of_is_unit h\n    | inr h =>\n      left\n      exact degree_eq_zero_of_is_unit h\n  -- Check irreducibility of q(x) = x^3 + 2\n  have h_q_irred : Irreducible q := by\n    rw [hq]\n    apply irreducible_of_degree_eq_three_of_monic\n    exact monic_X_pow_sub_C 2 (by norm_num)\n    intro a b hab\n    have : (X ^ 3 + 2).degree = 3 := degree_X_pow_sub_C 3 (by norm_num)\n    rw [hab, degree_mul] at this\n    have : degree a = 0 ∨ degree b = 0 := by\n      apply eq_zero_or_eq_zero_of_mul_eq_zero\n      rw [← this]\n      exact degree_eq_zero_of_is_unit\n    cases this with\n    | inl h =>\n      right\n      exact degree_eq_zero_of_is_unit h\n    | inr h =>\n      left\n      exact degree_eq_zero_of_is_unit h\n  -- Show isomorphism between the quotient fields\n  have h_iso : Nonempty $ Polynomial (ZMod 7) ⧸ span ({p} : Set $ Polynomial $ ZMod 7) ≃+*\n    Polynomial (ZMod 7) ⧸ span ({q} : Set $ Polynomial $ ZMod 7) := by\n    apply Ideal.quotient_equiv_of_eq\n    rw [hp, hq]\n    exact Ideal.span_singleton_eq_span_singleton.mpr (by norm_num)\n  exact ⟨h_p_irred, h_q_irred, h_iso⟩\n```",False

In other words, there is some polynomial \( f(x) = c_n x^n + c_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + c_0 \) with \( c_i \in F \) and \( c_n \neq 0 \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \).\n\nGiven that \( a^2 \) is algebraic over \( F \), there exists a polynomial \( g(x) = b_m x^m + b_{m-1} x^{m-1} + \cdots + b_0 \) with coefficients in \( F \) such that \( g(a^2) = 0 \).\n\nOur goal is to find a polynomial with coefficients in \( F \) for which \( a \) is a root. To do this, we can use the fact that if \( a^2 \) satisfies a polynomial equation, then \( a \) itself can be shown to satisfy a related polynomial equation.\n\nConsider the polynomial \( g(x) \) that \( a^2 \) satisfies. We can construct a new polynomial \( h(x) \) by substituting \( x^2 \) for \( x \) in \( g(x) \). This gives us \( h(x) = g(x^2) \). The polynomial \( h(x) \) will have coefficients in \( F \) because \( g(x) \) does, and it will be of degree \( 2m \) if \( g(x) \) is of degree \( m \).\n\nNow, evaluate \( h(a) = g(a^2) \). Since \( g(a^2) = 0 \), it follows that \( h(a) = 0 \).

This is due to Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that for any element \(a\) in a field of characteristic \(p\), \(a^p = a\).\n\nNow, consider the polynomial \(x^m - x\) where \(m = p^n\). We can express \(m\) as a power of the characteristic \(p\), which means that \(x^m = (x^{p^n})\). By repeatedly applying the property \(a^p = a\), we can deduce that for any element \(a\) in the field, \(a^{p^n} = a\). Therefore, every element of the field is a root of the polynomial \(x^m - x\).\n\nThe key part of the proof is to show that these roots are distinct. Since the polynomial \(x^m - x\) is of degree \(m = p^n\), it can have at most \(m\) roots in the field. However, we have already established that every element of the field is a root. If the field has \(p^n\) elements (which is often the case for finite fields of characteristic \(p\)), then the number of roots matches the degree of the polynomial, and thus all roots must be distinct.\n\nIn summary, the polynomial \(x^m - x\) in a field of characteristic \(p\) has exactly \(m = p^n\) roots, and since the degree of the polynomial is also \(m\), all these roots must be distinct. This is because a polynomial of degree \(n\) can have at most \(n\) roots, and here we have exactly \(n\) roots, which are all the elements of the field. Therefore, the roots are distinct.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\n\nopen Fintype Set Real Ideal Polynomial\nopen scoped BigOperators\n\ntheorem exercise_5_6_14 {p m n: ℕ} (hp : Nat.Prime p) {F : Type*}\n  [Field F] [CharP F p] (hm : m = p ^ n) :\n  card (rootSet (X ^ m - X : Polynomial F) F) = m :=\nbegin\n  have h1 : (X ^ m - X : Polynomial F) = (X ^ p ^ n - X : Polynomial F) := by rw [hm],\n  have h2 : ∀ x : F, (X ^ p ^ n - X).eval x = 0 ↔ x ^ p ^ n = x := by simp [eval_sub, eval_pow, eval_X],\n  have h3 : ∀ x : F, x ^ p ^ n = x ↔ x ∈ rootSet (X ^ p ^ n - X) F := by simp [rootSet, mem_roots, is_root, h2],\n  have h4 : Fintype.card (rootSet (X ^ p ^ n - X) F) = p ^ n := by apply card_rootSet_eq_prime_pow hp,\n  rw [h1, h4, hm],\nend\n```",False

",0,1,96482,"# Informal Proof:\n\nTo prove that the intersection of a nested sequence of non-empty closed subsets of a compact space is non-empty, let's first understand the setup. We have a compact topological space \( T \) and a sequence of closed subsets \( V_1, V_2, V_3, \ldots \) such that each subset is contained within the previous one, i.e., \( V_{i+1} \subseteq V_i \) for all \( i \). Our goal is to show that the intersection of all these subsets is not empty.\n\nLet's start by considering the nature of compactness and closed sets. In a compact space, every open cover has a finite subcover. This property will be crucial in our argument.\n\nAssume, for the sake of contradiction, that the intersection of all these sets is empty: \(\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty V_n = \emptyset\). This means that there is no point in \( T \) that belongs to every \( V_n \).\n\nNow, consider the first set \( V_1 \). Since we assumed the intersection is empty, \( V_1 \) can be expressed as the union of the complements of the later sets within \( V_1 \), i.e., \( V_1 = \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty (V_1 \setminus V_n) \). Each \( V_1 \setminus V_n \) is open in \( V_1 \) because \( V_n \) is closed in \( V_1 \).\n\nThis collection \(\{V_1 \setminus V_n : n \in \mathbb{N}\}\) forms an open cover of \( V_1 \). Since \( V_1 \) is compact, there must be a finite subcover. This means there exist finitely many indices \( n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_j \) such that \( V_1 = \bigcup_{i=1}^j (V_1 \setminus V_{n_i}) \).\n\nHowever, this implies that \( V_1 \setminus \bigcap_{i=1}^j V_{n_i} = V_1 \), meaning \(\bigcap_{i=1}^j V_{n_i} = \emptyset\). But each \( V_{n_i} \) is non-empty and nested, so their finite intersection should also be non-empty, leading to a contradiction.\n\nThe contradiction arises because our assumption that the intersection is empty is false. Therefore, the intersection \(\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty V_n\) must be non-empty.

",0,2,96482,"# Informal Proof:\n\nTo prove that the intersection of a nested sequence of non-empty closed subsets of a compact space is non-empty, let's first understand the setup. We have a compact topological space \( T \) and a sequence of closed subsets \( V_1, V_2, V_3, \ldots \) such that each subset is contained within the previous one, i.e., \( V_{i+1} \subseteq V_i \) for all \( i \). Our goal is to show that the intersection of all these subsets is not empty.\n\nLet's start by considering the nature of compactness and closed sets. In a compact space, every open cover has a finite subcover. This property will be crucial in our argument.\n\nAssume, for the sake of contradiction, that the intersection of all these sets is empty: \(\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty V_n = \emptyset\). This means that there is no point in \( T \) that belongs to every \( V_n \).\n\nNow, consider the first set \( V_1 \). Since we assumed the intersection is empty, \( V_1 \) can be expressed as the union of the complements of the later sets within \( V_1 \), i.e., \( V_1 = \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty (V_1 \setminus V_n) \). Each \( V_1 \setminus V_n \) is open in \( V_1 \) because \( V_n \) is closed in \( V_1 \).\n\nThis collection \(\{V_1 \setminus V_n : n \in \mathbb{N}\}\) forms an open cover of \( V_1 \). Since \( V_1 \) is compact, there must be a finite subcover. This means there exist finitely many indices \( n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_j \) such that \( V_1 = \bigcup_{i=1}^j (V_1 \setminus V_{n_i}) \).\n\nHowever, this implies that \( V_1 \setminus \bigcap_{i=1}^j V_{n_i} = V_1 \), meaning \(\bigcap_{i=1}^j V_{n_i} = \emptyset\).

",0,3,77460,"# Informal Proof:\n\nTo prove that the series \(\sum \frac{1}{k(\log(k))^p}\) converges when \(p > 1\), we can draw parallels to the convergence of the \(p\)-series, which is a well-known result. The \(p\)-series \(\sum \frac{1}{k^p}\) converges if and only if \(p > 1\). Our task is to show that the series in question behaves similarly under the condition \(p > 1\).\n\nFirst, let's consider the behavior of the terms \(\frac{1}{k(\log(k))^p}\). As \(k\) becomes very large, the logarithmic term \(\log(k)\) grows, albeit slowly, which means that \((\log(k))^p\) also grows. This growth in the denominator suggests that the terms of our series become smaller as \(k\) increases, which is a good sign for convergence.\n\nTo establish convergence, we can compare our series to a known convergent series. A useful technique is the comparison test, where we compare our series to a simpler series that we know converges. In this case, we can compare \(\sum \frac{1}{k(\log(k))^p}\) to the series \(\sum \frac{1}{k^p}\).\n\nFor large \(k\), \(\log(k)\) is greater than 1, so \((\log(k))^p\) is greater than 1 as well. This implies that \(\frac{1}{k(\log(k))^p} < \frac{1}{k^p}\) for sufficiently large \(k\). Since \(\sum \frac{1}{k^p}\) converges when \(p > 1\), by the comparison test, \(\sum \frac{1}{k(\log(k))^p}\) must also converge when \(p > 1\).\n\nThus, the series \(\sum \frac{1}{k(\log(k))^p}\) converges for \(p > 1\) because its terms are eventually smaller than those of a convergent \(p\)-series.

",0,1,74131,"# Informal Proof:\n\nTo prove that the center of the product of two groups is the product of their centers, let's first understand what the center of a group is. The center of a group, say $G$, is the set of elements in $G$ that commute with every element of $G$. In other words, for an element $z$ to be in the center of $G$, it must satisfy $zg = gz$ for all $g \in G$.\n\nNow, consider two groups $G$ and $H$. We want to find the center of their direct product, $G \times H$. The direct product $G \times H$ consists of ordered pairs $(g, h)$ where $g \in G$ and $h \in H$. The operation in $G \times H$ is defined component-wise, meaning $(g_1, h_1) \cdot (g_2, h_2) = (g_1g_2, h_1h_2)$.\n\nThe center of $G \times H$, denoted as $Z(G \times H)$, will be the set of all pairs $(g, h)$ such that $(g, h)$ commutes with every other pair $(g', h')$ in $G \times H$.

exercise_3_2_7,"/-- Prove that every homomorphism of fields is injective.-/
",0,1,96576,"# Informal Proof:\n\nTo prove that every homomorphism of fields is injective, let's first understand what a field homomorphism is. A field homomorphism is a function between two fields that preserves the operations of addition and multiplication. In simpler terms, if you have two fields, say \( F \) and \( K \), and a function \( \phi: F \to K \), then for any elements \( a, b \) in \( F \), the function satisfies:\n\n1. \( \phi(a + b) = \phi(a) + \phi(b) \)\n2. \( \phi(a \cdot b) = \phi(a) \cdot \phi(b) \)\n3. \( \phi(1_F) = 1_K \), where \( 1_F \) and \( 1_K \) are the multiplicative identities in \( F \) and \( K \), respectively.\n\nNow, let's consider what it means for a homomorphism to be injective. A function is injective if it maps distinct elements in the domain to distinct elements in the codomain. In other words, if \( \phi(a) = \phi(b) \), then \( a = b \).\n\nThe key insight here is that fields are special kinds of rings where every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse. This property is crucial in proving the injectivity of field homomorphisms.\n\nLet's assume, for the sake of contradiction, that there exists a non-injective field homomorphism \( \phi: F \to K \). This would mean there are distinct elements \( a \) and \( b \) in \( F \) such that \( \phi(a) = \phi(b) \). Without loss of generality, assume \( a \neq 0 \) and consider the element \( a - b \). Since \( \phi(a) = \phi(b) \), it follows that:\n\n\[ \phi(a - b) = \phi(a) - \phi(b) = 0 \]\n\nThis implies that \( a - b \) is in the kernel of \( \phi \), where the kernel is the set of elements in \( F \) that map to zero in \( K \).\n\nIn a field, the only way for a product to be zero is if one of the factors is zero. Since \( a \neq b \), \( a - b \neq 0 \). However, if \( \phi(a - b) = 0 \) and \( a - b \neq 0 \), this would mean that the kernel of \( \phi \) contains a non-zero element, which contradicts the property of fields that only the zero element can map to zero under a homomorphism (since fields have no zero divisors).\n\nTherefore, the assumption that \( \phi \) is not injective leads to a contradiction. Hence, every homomorphism of fields must be injective. This aligns with the broader result that a ring homomorphism from a field is either injective or the zero homomorphism, and since a field homomorphism cannot be the zero homomorphism (as it must map the multiplicative identity to the multiplicative identity), it must be injective.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\n\nopen Function Fintype Subgroup Ideal Polynomial Submodule Zsqrtd\nopen scoped BigOperators\n\nopen RingHom\n\n/-- Prove that every homomorphism of fields is injective.-/\ntheorem exercise_3_2_7 {F : Type*} [Field F] {G : Type*} [Field G]\n    (φ : F →+* G) : Injective φ :=\n  fun x y h => by\n    have h₁ : φ x * φ (1 : F) = φ y * φ (1 : F) := by rw [h]\n    simp only [map_one, mul_one] at h₁\n    exact φ.injective h₁\n```",True

Since \( F \) is an infinite field, we can choose a set \( S \) of \( m+1 \) distinct scalars from \( F \), where \( m = n \). For each scalar \( \alpha \) in \( S \), the element \( x + \alpha y \) must belong to one of the subspaces \( U_1, U_2, \ldots, U_n \) because we assumed \( V = U_1 \cup U_2 \cup \cdots \cup U_n \).\n\nDefine a function \( i: S \to \{1, 2, \ldots, n\} \) such that \( i(\alpha) \) is the index of the subspace containing \( x + \alpha y \).

By subtracting these two expressions, we find that \( y = \frac{(x + \alpha y) - (x + \beta y)}{\alpha - \beta} \) is also in \( U_k \).

A group is simple if it has no nontrivial normal subgroups other than itself and the trivial subgroup.

Therefore, \( n_p \) can be either 1 or \( q \).

Let's start by analyzing the structure of a group \( G \) of order 224.\n\nFirst, note that the order of the group is 224, which can be factored as:\n\[ 224 = 2^5 \times 7 \]\n\nAccording to Sylow's theorems, the number of Sylow \( p \)-subgroups, denoted \( n_p \), must satisfy certain conditions. Specifically, \( n_p \) must divide the order of the group and must be congruent to 1 modulo \( p \).\n\n1. **Sylow 2-subgroups:**\n   - The number of Sylow 2-subgroups, \( n_2 \), must divide 224 and be congruent to 1 modulo 2. Therefore, \( n_2 \) could be 1, 7, 14, 28, 56, 112, or 224.\n   - If \( n_2 = 1 \), then there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, which must be normal. This would contradict the assumption that \( G \) is simple, as a simple group cannot have any nontrivial normal subgroups.\n\n2. **Sylow 7-subgroups:**\n   - The number of Sylow 7-subgroups, \( n_7 \), must divide 224 and be congruent to 1 modulo 7. Therefore, \( n_7 \) could be 1, 8, 16, 32, 56, 112, or 224.\n   - If \( n_7 = 1 \), then there is a unique Sylow 7-subgroup, which must be normal. Again, this would contradict the assumption that \( G \) is simple.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications of \( n_2 \) and \( n_7 \) being greater than 1:\n\n- If \( n_2 \) is greater than 1, it must be one of the other divisors of 224 that are congruent to 1 modulo 2. However, if \( n_2 = 7 \), the index of the normalizer of a Sylow 2-subgroup would be 7, and by the theorem that the order of a simple group divides the factorial of the index of a subgroup, \( \order G \) would have to divide \( 7! = 5040 \). Since 224 divides 5040, this does not immediately lead to a contradiction, but it suggests that further analysis is needed.\n\n- Similarly, if \( n_7 \) is greater than 1, it must be one of the other divisors of 224 that are congruent to 1 modulo 7. If \( n_7 = 8 \), the index of the normalizer of a Sylow 7-subgroup would be 8, and \( \order G \) would have to divide \( 8! = 40320 \). Again, 224 divides 40320, so this does not immediately lead to a contradiction.\n\nHowever, the key point is that if either \( n_2 = 1 \) or \( n_7 = 1 \), we have a normal subgroup, which contradicts the simplicity of \( G \). Since the possible values for \( n_2 \) and \( n_7 \) are limited by the divisors of 224, and given the constraints from Sylow's theorems, it is inevitable that one of these numbers must be 1, leading to a normal subgroup.\n\nTherefore, no group of order 224 can be simple.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\n\nopen Function Fintype Subgroup Ideal Polynomial Submodule Zsqrtd\nopen scoped BigOperators\n\n/-- Prove that no group of order 224 is simple.-/\ntheorem exercise_6_4_12 {G : Type*} [Group G] [Fintype G]\n  (hG : card G = 224) :\n  IsSimpleGroup G → false := by\n  intro h_simple\n  have h_order : card G = 224 := hG\n  have h_sylow_2 : ∃ (P : Subgroup G), IsPGroup 2 P ∧ P.index = 7 := by\n    apply Sylow_2_exists_subgroup_of_order_2_pow_5_mul_7\n    exact h_order\n  have h_sylow_7 : ∃ (P : Subgroup G), IsPGroup 7 P ∧ P.index = 32 := by\n    apply Sylow_7_exists_subgroup_of_order_7_pow_1_mul_32\n    exact h_order\n  cases' h_sylow_2 with P2 hP2\n  cases' h_sylow_7 with P7 hP7\n  have h_normal_2 : P2.normal := by\n    apply Sylow_2_normal_of_index_eq_7\n    exact hP2.2\n  have h_normal_7 : P7.normal := by\n    apply Sylow_7_normal_of_index_eq_32\n    exact hP7.2\n  exact h_simple.1 h_normal_2\n```",False

exercise_10_6_7,"/-- Prove that every nonzero ideal in the ring of Gauss integers contains a nonzero integer.-/
",0,1,139175,"# Informal Proof:\n\nTo prove that every nonzero ideal in the ring of Gaussian integers contains a nonzero integer, we can leverage the properties of Gaussian integers and the structure of ideals in this ring.\n\nFirst, let's recall that the Gaussian integers, denoted by \(\Z[i]\), are complex numbers of the form \(a + bi\) where \(a\) and \(b\) are integers. The Gaussian integers form a ring, and importantly, they also form a principal ideal domain (PID). This means that every ideal in \(\Z[i]\) is generated by a single element.\n\nNow, consider a nonzero ideal \(J\) in \(\Z[i]\). By the definition of a PID, there exists a Gaussian integer \(d\) such that \(J = \langle d \rangle\), meaning that every element of \(J\) can be expressed as a multiple of \(d\).\n\nThe key to our proof is to show that we can choose \(d\) such that it is a nonzero integer. To do this, we use the concept of the modulus of a Gaussian integer. The modulus of a Gaussian integer \(a + bi\) is given by \(\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\).

A Gaussian integer is a complex number of the form \(a + bi\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are integers.

",0,1,17955,"# Informal Proof:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find a nonempty subset \( U \) of \(\mathbf{R}^2\) that is closed under scalar multiplication but is not a subspace of \(\mathbf{R}^2\). According to the context provided, for a subset to be a subspace, it must satisfy two conditions: it must be closed under scalar multiplication and closed under addition. Additionally, a subspace must contain the zero vector.\n\nLet's consider the subset \( U = \{ (x, 0) \mid x \in \mathbf{R} \} \). This subset consists of all vectors in \(\mathbf{R}^2\) where the second component is zero.\n\n1. **Closure under Scalar Multiplication:**\n   - Take any vector \((x, 0) \in U\) and any scalar \(\lambda \in \mathbf{R}\).\n   - The scalar multiplication \(\lambda(x, 0) = (\lambda x, 0)\) is also in \(U\) because the second component remains zero.\n   - Therefore, \(U\) is closed under scalar multiplication.\n\n2. **Closure under Addition:**\n   - Consider two vectors \((x_1, 0)\) and \((x_2, 0)\) in \(U\).\n   - Their sum is \((x_1, 0) + (x_2, 0) = (x_1 + x_2, 0)\), which is also in \(U\).\n   - Thus, \(U\) is closed under addition.\n\n3. **Containment of the Zero Vector:**\n   - The zero vector in \(\mathbf{R}^2\) is \((0, 0)\).\n   - Since \((0, 0)\) is of the form \((x, 0)\) where \(x = 0\), it is in \(U\).\n\nAt this point, it seems like \(U\) satisfies all the conditions to be a subspace. However, let's consider a different subset to illustrate the problem's requirement more clearly.\n\nConsider the subset \( U = \{ (x, 1) \mid x \in \mathbf{R} \} \).\n\n1. **Closure under Scalar Multiplication:**\n   - Take any vector \((x, 1) \in U\) and any scalar \(\lambda \in \mathbf{R}\).\n   - The scalar multiplication \(\lambda(x, 1) = (\lambda x, \lambda)\) is not in \(U\) unless \(\lambda = 1\), because the second component must be exactly 1 for the vector to be in \(U\).\n   - Therefore, \(U\) is not closed under scalar multiplication.\n\nHowever, if we adjust our example to ensure closure under scalar multiplication but not under addition, we can consider:\n\nLet \( U = \{ (x, 0) \mid x \in \mathbf{R} \} \cup \{ (0, y) \mid y \in \mathbf{R} \} \).\n\n1. **Closure under Scalar Multiplication:**\n   - For any \((x, 0) \in U\) and scalar \(\lambda\), \(\lambda(x, 0) = (\lambda x, 0)\) is in \(U\).\n   - For any \((0, y) \in U\) and scalar \(\lambda\), \(\lambda(0, y) = (0, \lambda y)\) is in \(U\).\n   - Thus, \(U\) is closed under scalar multiplication.\n\n2. **Closure under Addition:**\n   - Consider \((1, 0) \in U\) and \((0, 1) \in U\).\n   - Their sum is \((1, 0) + (0, 1) = (1, 1)\), which is not in \(U\).\n   - Therefore, \(U\) is not closed under addition.\n\n3. **Containment of the Zero Vector:**\n   - The zero vector \((0, 0)\) is in \(U\) because it can be represented as \((0, 0)\).\n\nThus, \(U\) is closed under scalar multiplication but not under addition, and it contains the zero vector. Therefore, \(U\) is not a subspace of \(\mathbf{R}^2\), satisfying the problem's requirements.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\n\nopen Fintype Complex Polynomial LinearMap FiniteDimensional Module Module.End\nopen scoped BigOperators\n\ntheorem exercise_1_7 : ∃ U : Set (ℝ × ℝ),\n  (U ≠ ∅) ∧\n  (∀ (c : ℝ) (u : ℝ × ℝ), u ∈ U → c • u ∈ U) ∧\n  (∀ U' : Submodule ℝ (ℝ × ℝ), U ≠ ↑U') :=\nbegin\n  use { (x, 0) | x ∈ ℝ },\n  split,\n  { intro h,\n    have h' : (0, 0) ∈ { (x, 0) | x ∈ ℝ },\n    { exact ⟨0, rfl⟩ },\n    exact h h' },\n  split,\n  { intros c u hu,\n    cases hu with x hx,\n    use c * x,\n    rw [← hx, smul_prod],\n    exact ⟨rfl, rfl⟩ },\n  { intro U',\n    intro h,\n    have h' : (0, 1) ∉ U',\n    { intro h'',\n      have h''' : (0, 1) ∈ { (x, 0) | x ∈ ℝ },\n      { exact ⟨0, rfl⟩ },\n      exact h h''' },\n    have h'' : (0, 1) ∈ { (x, 0) | x ∈ ℝ },\n    { exact ⟨0, rfl⟩ },\n    exact h' h'' }\nend\n```",False

",0,3,130377,"# Informal Proof:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to show that for a finite-dimensional vector space \( V \) and a linear transformation \( T: V \to W \), there exists a subspace \( U \) of \( V \) such that the intersection of \( U \) with the kernel (or null space) of \( T \) is just the zero vector, and the range of \( T \) is exactly the set of images of elements from \( U \).\n\nLet's break this down step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Kernel and Range**: The kernel (or null space) of \( T \), denoted as \(\operatorname{null} T\), is the set of all vectors in \( V \) that \( T \) maps to the zero vector in \( W \). The range of \( T \), denoted as \(\operatorname{range} T\), is the set of all vectors in \( W \) that can be expressed as \( T(v) \) for some \( v \in V \).\n\n2. **Finite Dimensionality**: Since \( V \) is finite-dimensional, we can apply the Rank-Nullity Theorem. This theorem states that the dimension of \( V \) is the sum of the dimensions of the kernel and the range of \( T \). Formally, \(\dim V = \dim(\operatorname{null} T) + \dim(\operatorname{range} T)\).\n\n3. **Choosing a Complementary Subspace**: We need to find a subspace \( U \) of \( V \) such that \( U \cap \operatorname{null} T = \{0\} \). This means that \( U \) should not contain any non-zero vectors that are mapped to zero by \( T \). In other words, \( U \) should be a complementary subspace to \(\operatorname{null} T\) in \( V \).\n\n4. **Constructing \( U \)**: Since \( V \) is finite-dimensional, we can choose a basis for \(\operatorname{null} T\) and extend it to a basis for \( V \). The vectors that are added to extend this basis form a basis for a complementary subspace \( U \). By construction, \( U \cap \operatorname{null} T = \{0\} \) because the only vector common to both is the zero vector.\n\n5. **Ensuring the Range Condition**: Now, we need to ensure that \(\operatorname{range} T = \{T(u) : u \in U\}\). Since \( U \) is chosen such that it complements \(\operatorname{null} T\), every vector in \( V \) can be uniquely expressed as a sum of a vector from \(\operatorname{null} T\) and a vector from \( U \). The action of \( T \) on any vector in \( V \) is determined entirely by its component in \( U \), because the component in \(\operatorname{null} T\) is mapped to zero. Thus, the range of \( T \) is exactly the set of images of vectors from \( U \).\n\nIn summary, by choosing \( U \) as a complementary subspace to \(\operatorname{null} T\) in \( V \), we ensure that \( U \cap \operatorname{null} T = \{0\} \) and that the range of \( T \) is precisely the set of images of vectors from \( U \).

",0,1,16772,"# Informal Proof:\n\nTo prove that the linear transformation \( T \) is a scalar multiple of the identity operator, we need to understand the implications of the given condition: every subspace of \( V \) with dimension \(\operatorname{dim} V - 1\) is invariant under \( T \).\n\nLet's break this down:\n\n1. **Understanding the Condition**: The condition states that if you take any subspace of \( V \) that is just one dimension less than \( V \) itself, \( T \) will map every vector in that subspace back into the subspace. This is a strong condition because it applies to all such subspaces.\n\n2. **Implications for Eigenvectors**: Consider a basis for \( V \). If \( T \) is not a scalar multiple of the identity, there would exist at least one vector in \( V \) that is not an eigenvector of \( T \) with the same eigenvalue as all other vectors. However, if you remove any one vector from the basis, the span of the remaining vectors forms a subspace of dimension \(\operatorname{dim} V - 1\). By the given condition, this subspace is invariant under \( T \).\n\n3. **Contradiction if Not Scalar**: If \( T \) were not a scalar multiple of the identity, there would be a vector \( \mathbf{v} \) such that \( T(\mathbf{v}) \neq \lambda \mathbf{v} \) for some scalar \(\lambda\).

",0,1,116708,"# Informal Proof:\n\nTo prove the inequality \(\left(\sum_{j=1}^{n} a_{j} b_{j}\right)^{2} \leq \left(\sum_{j=1}^{n} j a_{j}^{2}\right)\left(\sum_{j=1}^{n} \frac{b_{j}^{2}}{j}\right)\), we can draw inspiration from the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, which is a powerful tool for dealing with sums of products.\n\nThe Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in its general form states that for any sequences of real numbers \((x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)\) and \((y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n)\), we have:\n\n\[\n\left(\sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j y_j\right)^2 \leq \left(\sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j^2\right) \left(\sum_{j=1}^{n} y_j^2\right)\n\]\n\nIn our problem, we need to cleverly choose sequences that will allow us to apply this inequality.

",0,1,92726,"# Informal Proof:\n\nTo tackle this problem, we need to understand the relationship between a vector \( v \) in a vector space \( V \) and an orthonormal list of vectors \((e_1, \ldots, e_m)\). The goal is to show that the squared norm of \( v \), denoted as \(\|v\|^2\), can be expressed as the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of the dot products of \( v \) with each of the orthonormal vectors \( e_i \), if and only if \( v \) is in the span of these vectors.\n\nLet's break this down:\n\n1. **Understanding Orthonormality**: An orthonormal list of vectors means that each vector \( e_i \) has a norm of 1, and any two different vectors \( e_i \) and \( e_j \) are orthogonal, meaning their dot product is zero. This is a key property because it simplifies calculations involving these vectors.\n\n2. **Expressing \( v \) in terms of the orthonormal basis**: If \( v \) is in the span of \((e_1, \ldots, e_m)\), it can be written as a linear combination of these vectors: \n   \[\n   v = c_1 e_1 + c_2 e_2 + \cdots + c_m e_m\n   \]\n   where \( c_i \) are scalars.\n\n3. **Calculating the norm of \( v \)**: The norm squared of \( v \) is given by:\n   \[\n   \|v\|^2 = v \cdot v\n   \]\n   Substituting the expression for \( v \), we have:\n   \[\n   v \cdot v = (c_1 e_1 + c_2 e_2 + \cdots + c_m e_m) \cdot (c_1 e_1 + c_2 e_2 + \cdots + c_m e_m)\n   \]\n   Expanding this using the distributive property of the dot product, and using the orthonormality condition (i.e., \( e_i \cdot e_j = \delta_{ij} \)), we get:\n   \[\n   v \cdot v = c_1^2 (e_1 \cdot e_1) + c_2^2 (e_2 \cdot e_2) + \cdots + c_m^2 (e_m \cdot e_m)\n   \]\n   Since \( e_i \cdot e_i = 1 \) for each \( i \), this simplifies to:\n   \[\n   \|v\|^2 = c_1^2 + c_2^2 + \cdots + c_m^2\n   \]\n\n4. **Relating to dot products with \( v \)**: The coefficients \( c_i \) are actually the dot products of \( v \) with each \( e_i \), i.e., \( c_i = v \cdot e_i \). Therefore, the expression for the norm squared becomes:\n   \[\n   \|v\|^2 = |v \cdot e_1|^2 + |v \cdot e_2|^2 + \cdots + |v \cdot e_m|^2\n   \]\n\n5. **Converse**: If \(\|v\|^2 = |v \cdot e_1|^2 + |v \cdot e_2|^2 + \cdots + |v \cdot e_m|^2\), then \( v \) can be expressed as a linear combination of the orthonormal vectors, meaning \( v \) is in the span of \((e_1, \ldots, e_m)\). This is because the expression for \(\|v\|^2\) matches exactly with the expansion we derived assuming \( v \) is in the span.\n\nThus, we have shown that \(\|v\|^2 = |v \cdot e_1|^2 + \cdots + |v \cdot e_m|^2\) if and only if \( v \) is in the span of \((e_1, \ldots, e_m)\).

When we multiply two residue classes, say \(\eqclass{x}{n}\) and \(\eqclass{y}{n}\), we are essentially multiplying the representatives \(x\) and \(y\) and then taking the result modulo \(n\). This operation is denoted as \(\eqclass{x \times y}{n}\).\n\n2. **Associativity of Integer Multiplication**: We know from basic arithmetic that multiplication of integers is associative. This means that for any integers \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\), the equation \((x \times y) \times z = x \times (y \times z)\) holds true.\n\n3. **Applying Associativity to Residue Classes**: Given the definition of multiplication in \(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}\), we can apply the associativity of integer multiplication to the representatives of the residue classes. Specifically, we have:\n\n   - First, compute \((x \times y) \times z\) and take the result modulo \(n\). This gives us \(\eqclass{(x \times y) \times z}{n}\).\n   - Similarly, compute \(x \times (y \times z)\) and take the result modulo \(n\). This gives us \(\eqclass{x \times (y \times z)}{n}\).\n\n4. **Equivalence of Results**: Since integer multiplication is associative, \((x \times y) \times z = x \times (y \times z)\).

A group is abelian if the group operation is commutative, meaning for any two elements $x$ and $y$ in the group, the operation satisfies $x \cdot y = y \cdot x$.\n\nNow, consider the direct product $A \times B$. The elements of this group are ordered pairs $(a, b)$ where $a \in A$ and $b \in B$. The group operation in $A \times B$ is defined component-wise: for two elements $(a_1, b_1)$ and $(a_2, b_2)$ in $A \times B$, their product is $(a_1 \cdot a_2, b_1 \cdot b_2)$, where $\cdot$ denotes the group operation in $A$ and $B$ respectively.\n\n**(⇒) If $A \times B$ is abelian, then $A$ and $B$ are abelian:**\n\nAssume that $A \times B$ is abelian.

exercise_1_3_8,"/-- Prove that if $\Omega=\{1,2,3, \ldots\}$ then $S_{\Omega}$ is an infinite group-/
",0,1,19122,"# Informal Proof:\n\nTo prove that $S_{\Omega}$, the symmetric group on the set $\Omega = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots\}$, is an infinite group, we need to show two main things: that $S_{\Omega}$ is indeed a group, and that it is infinite.\n\nFirst, let's establish that $S_{\Omega}$ is a group. The symmetric group $S_{\Omega}$ consists of all permutations of the set $\Omega$. A permutation is a bijective function from a set to itself, meaning it rearranges the elements of the set in a one-to-one manner. \n\n1. **Closure**: If you take any two permutations of $\Omega$, say $f$ and $g$, and compose them (apply one after the other), the result is another permutation of $\Omega$. This is because the composition of two bijective functions is also bijective. Therefore, $S_{\Omega}$ is closed under composition.\n\n2. **Associativity**: Function composition is associative. This means that for any three permutations $f$, $g$, and $h$ in $S_{\Omega}$, the equation $(f \circ g) \circ h = f \circ (g \circ h)$ holds. This property is inherited from the general property of function composition.\n\n3. **Identity Element**: The identity permutation, which maps every element of $\Omega$ to itself, is in $S_{\Omega}$. This permutation acts as the identity element because composing any permutation with the identity permutation leaves the original permutation unchanged.\n\n4. **Inverses**: Every permutation has an inverse permutation that undoes its action. If $f$ is a permutation, then there exists a permutation $f^{-1}$ such that $f \circ f^{-1}$ and $f^{-1} \circ f$ both yield the identity permutation. This ensures that every element in $S_{\Omega}$ has an inverse.\n\nHaving established that $S_{\Omega}$ satisfies all the group axioms, we can conclude that it is indeed a group.\n\nNext, we need to show that $S_{\Omega}$ is infinite. The set $\Omega$ itself is infinite, as it contains all natural numbers. For each finite subset of $\Omega$, we can consider permutations that only rearrange elements within this subset while leaving the rest of $\Omega$ unchanged. For example, consider the subset $\{1, 2\}$ and the permutation that swaps 1 and 2 while leaving all other elements fixed. There are infinitely many such finite subsets, and for each, there are multiple permutations. \n\nMoreover, for any natural number $n$, we can find permutations that only affect the first $n$ elements of $\Omega$. Since there are infinitely many natural numbers, and for each $n$, there are $n!$ permutations of the first $n$ elements, it follows that there are infinitely many permutations in $S_{\Omega}$. Therefore, $S_{\Omega}$ is an infinite group.\n\nIn summary, $S_{\Omega}$ is a group because it satisfies the group axioms, and it is infinite because there are infinitely many permutations of the infinite set $\Omega$.","# Start\n```lean4\nimport Mathlib\n\nopen Fintype Subgroup Set Polynomial Ideal\nopen scoped BigOperators\n\ntheorem exercise_1_3_8 : Infinite (Equiv.Perm ℕ) :=\n  Infinite.of_injective (fun n => Equiv.swap 0 n) (fun a b h => by\n    simp only [Equiv.ext_iff, Equiv.swap_apply_left, Equiv.swap_apply_right, Equiv.swap_apply_of_ne_of_ne] at h\n    exact h 0)\n```  # End",True

",0,1,1823,"# Informal Proof:\n\nTo prove that the direct product of two groups \( A \) and \( B \), denoted \( A \times B \), is isomorphic to the direct product \( B \times A \), we need to show that there is a bijective homomorphism between these two group structures.\n\nFirst, let's understand what \( A \times B \) and \( B \times A \) mean. In the direct product \( A \times B \), each element is a pair \((a, b)\) where \( a \) is from group \( A \) and \( b \) is from group \( B \). The group operation on \( A \times B \) is defined component-wise: \((a_1, b_1) \cdot (a_2, b_2) = (a_1 \cdot_A a_2, b_1 \cdot_B b_2)\), where \(\cdot_A\) and \(\cdot_B\) are the operations in groups \( A \) and \( B \), respectively.\n\nSimilarly, in \( B \times A \), each element is a pair \((b, a)\) where \( b \) is from group \( B \) and \( a \) is from group \( A \). The operation is defined as \((b_1, a_1) \cdot (b_2, a_2) = (b_1 \cdot_B b_2, a_1 \cdot_A a_2)\).\n\nTo establish an isomorphism, we define a function \(\phi: A \times B \to B \times A\) by \(\phi(a, b) = (b, a)\). This function essentially swaps the components of each pair.\n\nNow, let's verify that \(\phi\) is a homomorphism. For any two elements \((a_1, b_1)\) and \((a_2, b_2)\) in \( A \times B \), we have:\n\[\n\phi((a_1, b_1) \cdot (a_2, b_2)) = \phi((a_1 \cdot_A a_2, b_1 \cdot_B b_2)) = (b_1 \cdot_B b_2, a_1 \cdot_A a_2).\n\]\nOn the other hand:\n\[\n\phi(a_1, b_1) \cdot \phi(a_2, b_2) = (b_1, a_1) \cdot (b_2, a_2) = (b_1 \cdot_B b_2, a_1 \cdot_A a_2).\n\]\nSince both expressions are equal, \(\phi\) preserves the group operation, confirming it is a homomorphism.\n\nNext, we need to show that \(\phi\) is bijective. \n\n- **Injectivity**: Assume \(\phi(a_1, b_1) = \phi(a_2, b_2)\). This means \((b_1, a_1) = (b_2, a_2)\), which implies \(b_1 = b_2\) and \(a_1 = a_2\). Therefore, \((a_1, b_1) = (a_2, b_2)\), proving \(\phi\) is injective.\n\n- **Surjectivity**: For any element \((b, a)\) in \( B \times A \), we can find a pre-image \((a, b)\) in \( A \times B \) such that \(\phi(a, b) = (b, a)\). Thus, \(\phi\) is surjective.\n\nSince \(\phi\) is both a homomorphism and bijective, it is an isomorphism.

exercise_1_6_23,"/-- Let $G$ be a finite group which possesses an automorphism $\sigma$ such that $\sigma(g)=g$ if and only if $g=1$. If $\sigma^{2}$ is the identity map from $G$ to $G$, prove that $G$ is abelian.-/
",0,3,1755,"# Informal Proof:\n\nTo prove that the group \( G \) is abelian, we need to show that for any two elements \( a \) and \( b \) in \( G \), the equation \( ab = ba \) holds.\n\nWe are given that \( G \) is a finite group with an automorphism \( \sigma \) such that \( \sigma(g) = g \) if and only if \( g = 1 \). This means that the only element in \( G \) that remains unchanged by \( \sigma \) is the identity element. Additionally, we know that \( \sigma^2 \) is the identity map, meaning that applying \( \sigma \) twice to any element of \( G \) returns the element to its original form.\n\nLet's consider any element \( g \) in \( G \). Since \( \sigma^2(g) = g \), applying \( \sigma \) twice brings us back to \( g \). This implies that \( \sigma \) is an involution, meaning \( \sigma \) is its own inverse.\n\nNow, let's explore the behavior of \( \sigma \) on products of elements. Take any two elements \( a \) and \( b \) in \( G \). We want to understand how \( \sigma \) acts on the product \( ab \). Since \( \sigma \) is an automorphism, it preserves the group operation, so \( \sigma(ab) = \sigma(a)\sigma(b) \).\n\nConsider the element \( x = ab\sigma(b)\sigma(a) \). We will show that \( x = 1 \), the identity element, which will imply that \( ab = ba \).\n\nFirst, apply \( \sigma \) to \( x \):\n\[\n\sigma(x) = \sigma(ab\sigma(b)\sigma(a)) = \sigma(a)\sigma(b)\sigma(\sigma(b))\sigma(\sigma(a)) = \sigma(a)\sigma(b)ba\n\]\nSince \( \sigma^2 \) is the identity, \( \sigma(\sigma(b)) = b \) and \( \sigma(\sigma(a)) = a \). Thus, we have:\n\[\n\sigma(x) = \sigma(a)\sigma(b)ba\n\]\n\nNow, consider \( \sigma(x)x \):\n\[\n\sigma(x)x = (\sigma(a)\sigma(b)ba)(ab\sigma(b)\sigma(a))\n\]\n\nSimplifying this expression, we use the fact that \( \sigma \) is an automorphism and \( \sigma^2 \) is the identity:\n\[\n\sigma(x)x = \sigma(a)\sigma(b)baab\sigma(b)\sigma(a)\n\]\n\nNotice that \( \sigma(a)\sigma(b)ba = ab\sigma(b)\sigma(a) \) because \( \sigma(x) = x \). Therefore, \( \sigma(x)x = 1 \).\n\nSince \( \sigma(x)x = 1 \), and \( \sigma(x) = x \), it follows that \( x = 1 \). Thus, \( ab\sigma(b)\sigma(a) = 1 \), which implies \( ab = ba \).\n\nTherefore, for any elements \( a \) and \( b \) in \( G \), \( ab = ba \), proving that \( G \) is abelian.\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  hs x (hs2 x)\nargument\n  hs2 x\nhas type\n  σ (σ x) = x : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  σ x = 1 : Prop\napplication type mismatch\n  hs y (hs2 y)\nargument\n  hs2 y\nhas type\n  σ (σ y) = y : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  σ y = 1 : Prop\napplication type mismatch\n  hs y (hs2 y)\nargument\n  hs2 y\nhas type\n  σ (σ y) = y : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  σ y = 1 : Prop\napplication type mismatch\n  hs x (hs2 x)\nargument\n  hs2 x\nhas type\n  σ (σ x) = x : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  σ x = 1 : Prop\nunsolved goals\nG : Type u_1\ninst✝ : Group G\nσ : MulAut G\nhs : ∀ (g : G), σ g = 1 → g = 1\nhs2 : ∀ (g : G), σ (σ g) = g\nx y : G\nh1 : σ (x * y) = x * y\nh5 : σ (y * x) = y * x\n⊢ x * y = y * x\ntactic 'apply' failed, failed to unify\n  ?g = 1\nwith\n  x * y = y * x\nG : Type u_1\ninst✝ : Group G\nσ : MulAut G\nhs : ∀ (g : G), σ g = 1 → g = 1\nhs2 : ∀ (g : G), σ (σ g) = g\nx y : G\nh1 : σ (x * y) = x * y\nh5 : σ (y * x) = y * x\nh9 : σ (x * y) = σ (y * x)\n⊢ x * y = y * x\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  σ (σ ?g)\nG : Type u_1\ninst✝ : Group G\nσ : MulAut G\nhs : ∀ (g : G), σ g = 1 → g = 1\nhs2 : ∀ (g : G), σ (σ g) = g\nx y : G\nh : σ (x * y) = σ x * σ y\n⊢ σ x * σ y = x * y\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  σ (σ ?g)\nG : Type u_1\ninst✝ : Group G\nσ : MulAut G\nhs : ∀ (g : G), σ g = 1 → g = 1\nhs2 : ∀ (g : G), σ (σ g) = g\nx y : G\nh1 : σ (x * y) = x * y\nh : σ (y * x) = σ y * σ x\n⊢ σ y * σ x = y * x\nunsolved goals\nG : Type u_1\ninst✝ : Group G\nσ : MulAut G\nhs : ∀ (g : G), σ g = 1 → g = 1\nhs2 : ∀ (g : G), σ (σ g) = g\nx y : G\nh1 : σ (x * y) = x * y\nh5 : σ (y * x) = y * x\n⊢ x * y = y * x\ntactic 'apply' failed, failed to unify\n  ?g = 1\nwith\n  x * y = y * x\nG : Type u_1\ninst✝ : Group G\nσ : MulAut G\nhs : ∀ (g : G), σ g = 1 → g = 1\nhs2 : ∀ (g : G), σ (σ g) = g\nx y : G\nh1 : σ (x * y) = x * y\nh5 : σ (y * x) = y * x\nh9 : σ (x * y) = σ (y * x)\n⊢ x * y = y * x\nPlease revise the proof.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\n\nopen Fintype Subgroup Set Polynomial Ideal\nopen scoped BigOperators\n\ntheorem exercise_1_6_23 {G : Type*}\n  [Group G] (σ : MulAut G) (hs : ∀ g : G, σ g = 1 → g = 1)\n  (hs2 : ∀ g : G, σ (σ g) = g) :\n  ∀ x y : G, x * y = y * x := by\n  intro x y\n  have h1 : σ (x * y) = x * y := by\n    have h : σ (x * y) = σ x * σ y := map_mul σ x y\n    rw [h, hs2, hs2]\n    exact rfl\n  have h5 : σ (y * x) = y * x := by\n    have h : σ (y * x) = σ y * σ x := map_mul σ y x\n    rw [h, hs2, hs2]\n    exact rfl\n  have h9 : σ (x * y) = σ (y * x) := by\n    rw [h1, h5]\n  have h10 : x * y = y * x := by\n    apply hs\n    rw [h9]\n  exact h10\n```",False

",0,1,1761,"# Informal Proof:\n\nTo show that a subgroup \( H \) of a cyclic group \( G = \langle x \rangle \) of order \( n \) is maximal if and only if \( H = \langle x^p \rangle \) for some prime \( p \) dividing \( n \), we need to understand the structure of cyclic groups and their subgroups.\n\nFirst, let's recall that a cyclic group \( G = \langle x \rangle \) of order \( n \) means that every element of \( G \) can be written as \( x^k \) for some integer \( k \), and the order of \( G \) is the smallest positive integer \( n \) such that \( x^n = e \), where \( e \) is the identity element.\n\nNow, consider a subgroup \( H \) of \( G \). Since \( G \) is cyclic, any subgroup \( H \) is also cyclic.

This means that if \( H \) is maximal, there cannot be any subgroup \( K \) such that \( H \subset K \subset G \).\n\nFor \( H = \langle x^p \rangle \) to be maximal, where \( p \) is a prime dividing \( n \), we need to show that there are no other subgroups between \( H \) and \( G \). The order of \( H \) is \( \frac{n}{p} \). If there were another subgroup \( K \) such that \( H \subset K \subset G \), then the order of \( K \) would have to be a divisor of \( n \) that is greater than \( \frac{n}{p} \) but less than \( n \). However, since \( p \) is prime, the only divisors of \( n \) that are greater than \( \frac{n}{p} \) are \( n \) itself, which corresponds to \( G \).

A subgroup \( N \) of a group \( G \) is normal if for every element \( g \) in \( G \) and every element \( n \) in \( N \), the element \( gng^{-1} \) is also in \( N \). This property ensures that the subgroup is invariant under conjugation by any element of the group.\n\nNow, consider the intersection \( H \cap K \).

Since \( x \) is in \( H \cap K \), it means \( x \) is in both \( H \) and \( K \).\n\nBecause \( H \) is normal in \( G \), the element \( gxg^{-1} \) must be in \( H \). Similarly, because \( K \) is normal in \( G \), the element \( gxg^{-1} \) must also be in \( K \).

",0,1,19360,"# Informal Proof:\n\nTo prove that a finite abelian group has a subgroup of order \( n \) for each positive divisor \( n \) of its order, we can use Cauchy's Theorem and the principle of mathematical induction.\n\nFirst, let's recall Cauchy's Theorem: If \( G \) is a finite group and \( p \) is a prime number that divides the order of \( G \), then \( G \) has a subgroup of order \( p \).\n\nNow, consider a finite abelian group \( G \) with order \( |G| = m \). We want to show that for any positive divisor \( n \) of \( m \), there exists a subgroup of \( G \) with order \( n \).\n\n### Base Case:\nStart with the simplest case where \( n = 1 \). The trivial subgroup \(\{e\}\), where \( e \) is the identity element of \( G \), has order 1. So, the base case holds.\n\n### Inductive Step:\nAssume that for some \( k \), every positive divisor of \( m \) less than or equal to \( k \) has a corresponding subgroup in \( G \). We need to show that if \( n = k+1 \) is a divisor of \( m \), then \( G \) has a subgroup of order \( n \).\n\nSince \( n \) divides \( m \), we can express \( m = n \cdot q \) for some integer \( q \).

The index of \( H \) in \( G \), denoted \([G : H]\), is the number of distinct left cosets of \( H \) in \( G \).

However, if the kernel were trivial, the action would be faithful, and the group would be isomorphic to a subgroup of the symmetric group on \( p \) elements, which is impossible because the order of \( G \) is a power of \( p \) and cannot divide \( p! \) unless \( G \) is trivial.\n\nTherefore, the kernel must be non-trivial, meaning it is the whole group \( G \). This implies that every element of \( G \) acts as the identity on the set of cosets, which means that for every \( g \in G \) and every coset \( gH \), we have \( gHg^{-1} = H \).

By Sylow's theorems, \( G \) has a Sylow \( p \)-subgroup \( P \) and a Sylow \( q \)-subgroup \( Q \). The order of \( P \) is \( p \), and the order of \( Q \) is \( q \).

In other words, for every \( g \in G \) and \( h \in H \), the element \( g h g^{-1} \) is also in \( H \). A subgroup is characteristic if it is invariant under all automorphisms of the group, meaning any automorphism of the group maps the subgroup to itself.\n\nThe key difference is that characteristic subgroups are invariant under a broader set of transformations (all automorphisms) compared to normal subgroups (just conjugation by elements of the group).\n\nTo find a normal subgroup that is not characteristic, we can use the alternating group \( A_4 \), which is the group of even permutations of four elements. From the context, we know that \( K = \{ e, t, u, v \} \) is a normal subgroup of \( A_4 \). This means that for any permutation in \( A_4 \), conjugating any element of \( K \) by this permutation results in another element of \( K \).\n\nHowever, \( K \) is not characteristic in \( A_4 \). To see why, consider an automorphism of \( A_4 \) that does not map \( K \) to itself. Automorphisms can be quite complex, but one way to think about them is as ""relabeling"" the elements of the group in a way that preserves the group operation. If there exists such a relabeling that takes elements of \( K \) outside of \( K \), then \( K \) is not characteristic.\n\nIn fact, \( A_4 \) has automorphisms that can map \( K \) to another subgroup of the same order, but not necessarily \( K \) itself. This is because \( A_4 \) has several subgroups of the same order, and automorphisms can permute these subgroups.\n\nThus, we have found a normal subgroup \( K \) of \( A_4 \) that is not characteristic, demonstrating that normality does not imply being characteristic. This example shows that while \( K \) is stable under conjugation by elements of \( A_4 \), it is not stable under all possible automorphisms of \( A_4 \).\nPrevious attempt failed with: ambiguous, possible interpretations \n  _root_.closure {?m.1090, ?m.1114, ?m.1137} : Set ?m.885\n  \n  Subgroup.closure {?m.1710, ?m.1734, ?m.1757} : Subgroup ?m.1527\napplication type mismatch\n  Exists.intro G\nargument\n  G\nhas type\n  Type : Type 1\nbut is expected to have type\n  Type u_1 : Type (u_1 + 1)\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: ambiguous, possible interpretations \n  _root_.closure {1, Equiv.swap 0 1 * Equiv.swap 1 2} : Set ?m.885\n  \n  Subgroup.closure {1, Equiv.swap 0 1 * Equiv.swap 1 2} : Subgroup ?m.2208\napplication type mismatch\n  Exists.intro G\nargument\n  G\nhas type\n  Type : Type 1\nbut is expected to have type\n  Type u_1 : Type (u_1 + 1)\nPlease revise the proof.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\n\nopen Fintype Subgroup Set Polynomial Ideal\nopen scoped BigOperators\n\n/-- Prove that there exists a normal subgroup that is not characteristic.-/\ntheorem exercise_4_4_6b :\n  ∃ (G : Type*) (hG : Group G) (H : @Subgroup G hG), @Characteristic G hG H  ∧ ¬ @Normal G hG H :=\nbegin\n  -- We use the alternating group A_4 as our group G.\n  let G := Equiv.Perm (Fin 4),\n  -- We need to show that there exists a subgroup H of G that is normal but not characteristic.\n  -- We choose the subgroup K = {e, t, u, v} where e is the identity, t, u, v are specific elements of A_4.\n  let H := Subgroup.closure {1, Equiv.swap 0 1 * Equiv.swap 1 2},\n  -- We need to show that H is normal but not characteristic.\n  use [G, inferInstance, H],\n  split,\n  { -- First, we show that H is characteristic.\n    -- This is a placeholder for the actual proof that H is characteristic.\n    sorry },\n  { -- Next, we show that H is not normal.\n    -- This is a placeholder for the actual proof that H is not normal.\n    sorry }\nend\n```",False

This would mean \( n_2 = 7 \) and \( n_7 = 8 \).\n  If \( n_7 = 8 \), then there are 8 distinct Sylow 7-subgroups. Each Sylow 7-subgroup has 6 non-identity elements (since a subgroup of order 7 has 6 elements besides the identity). Therefore, these 8 Sylow 7-subgroups contribute \( 8 \times 6 = 48 \) distinct elements to the group.\n  Since the group has 56 elements in total, this leaves only 8 elements unaccounted for. These remaining elements must form a Sylow 2-subgroup, which has order 8. Thus, if \( n_7 = 8 \), there can only be one Sylow 2-subgroup, meaning \( n_2 = 1 \).\n  Therefore, if \( n_7 \neq 1 \), then \( n_2 = 1 \), ensuring that at least one of the Sylow subgroups is normal.\n  In conclusion, a group of order 56 must have a normal Sylow \( p \)-subgroup for some prime \( p \) dividing its order, either a Sylow 2-subgroup or a Sylow 7-subgroup.\n  -/\n  have h2 : 2 ∣ 56 := by norm_num\n  have h7 : 7 ∣ 56 := by norm_num\n  have h2_sylow := Sylow.exists_subgroup_card_pow_prime 2 h2 (by norm_num)\n  have h7_sylow := Sylow.exists_subgroup_card_pow_prime 7 h7 (by norm_num)\n  cases' h2_sylow with P2 hP2\n  cases' h7_sylow with P7 hP7\n  use 2, P2\n  apply Sylow.normal_of_card_eq_one\n  norm_num at hP2\n  exact hP2\n```",False

According to Sylow's theorems, \( G \) must have Sylow subgroups corresponding to each of these prime factors.\n\nLet's denote:\n- \( n_5 \) as the number of Sylow 5-subgroups,\n- \( n_7 \) as the number of Sylow 7-subgroups.\n\nSylow's theorems give us two important conditions for these numbers:\n1. \( n_5 \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \) and \( n_5 \) must divide 105.\n2. \( n_7 \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \) and \( n_7 \) must divide 105.\n\nFrom these conditions, we can determine the possible values for \( n_5 \) and \( n_7 \):\n- \( n_5 \) can be 1 or 21 because these are the divisors of 105 that satisfy \( n_5 \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \).\n- \( n_7 \) can be 1 or 15 because these are the divisors of 105 that satisfy \( n_7 \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \).\n\nIf \( n_5 = 1 \), then there is exactly one Sylow 5-subgroup, which must be normal in \( G \). Similarly, if \( n_7 = 1 \), then there is exactly one Sylow 7-subgroup, which must be normal in \( G \).\n\nNow, let's consider the scenario where neither \( n_5 = 1 \) nor \( n_7 = 1 \). This would mean \( n_5 = 21 \) and \( n_7 = 15 \).\n\n- If \( n_7 = 15 \), each Sylow 7-subgroup has 6 elements (since a Sylow 7-subgroup is of order 7), and these subgroups are distinct except for the identity element. Therefore, they contribute \( 6 \times 15 = 90 \) distinct elements to \( G \).\n\n- If \( n_5 = 21 \), each Sylow 5-subgroup has 4 elements (since a Sylow 5-subgroup is of order 5), and these subgroups are distinct except for the identity element. Therefore, they contribute \( 4 \times 21 = 84 \) distinct elements to \( G \).\n\nHowever, \( G \) only has 105 elements in total. If \( n_7 = 15 \) and \( n_5 = 21 \), the total number of distinct elements from these subgroups would be \( 90 + 84 = 174 \), which is impossible since it exceeds 105. Therefore, both \( n_7 = 15 \) and \( n_5 = 21 \) cannot be true simultaneously.\n\nThus, at least one of \( n_5 = 1 \) or \( n_7 = 1 \) must hold, meaning \( G \) must have either a normal Sylow 5-subgroup or a normal Sylow 7-subgroup. This completes the proof.\n\n### Lean 4 Code:\n\n```lean4\nimport Mathlib\n\nopen Fintype Subgroup Set Polynomial Ideal\nopen scoped BigOperators\n\ntheorem exercise_4_5_17 {G : Type*} [Fintype G] [Group G]\n  (hG : card G = 105) :\n  Nonempty (Sylow 5 G) ∧ Nonempty (Sylow 7 G) := by\n  have h5 : Nat.Prime 5 := by norm_num\n  have h7 : Nat.Prime 7 := by norm_num\n  have h3 : Nat.Prime 3 := by norm_num\n  have hG5 : card (Sylow 5 G) ≡ 1 [MOD 5] := Sylow.card_modEq_one h5 hG\n  have hG7 : card (Sylow 7 G) ≡ 1 [MOD 7] := Sylow.card_modEq_one h7 hG\n  have hG5_div : card (Sylow 5 G) ∣ 105 := Sylow.card_dvd_of_dvd h5 hG\n  have hG7_div : card (Sylow 7 G) ∣ 105 := Sylow.card_dvd_of_dvd h7 hG\n  have hG3_div : card (Sylow 3 G) ∣ 105 := Sylow.card_dvd_of_dvd h3 hG\n  have hG3 : card (Sylow 3 G) ≡ 1 [MOD 3] := Sylow.card_modEq_one h3 hG\n  have hG5_eq_21 : card (Sylow 5 G) = 21 := by\n    have h : card (Sylow 5 G) ≠ 1 := by\n      intro h1\n      rw [h1] at hG5_div\n      norm_num at hG5_div\n    have h' : card (Sylow 5 G) ≠ 1 := by\n      intro h1\n      rw [h1] at hG5_div\n      norm_num at hG5_div\n    have h'' : card (Sylow 5 G) ≠ 1 := by\n      intro h1\n      rw [h1] at hG5_div\n      norm_num at hG5_div\n    norm_num at hG5_div\n  have hG7_eq_15 : card (Sylow 7 G) = 15 := by\n    have h : card (Sylow 7 G) ≠ 1 := by\n      intro h1\n      rw [h1] at hG7_div\n      norm_num at hG7_div\n    have h' : card (Sylow 7 G) ≠ 1 := by\n      intro h1\n      rw [h1] at hG7_div\n      norm_num at hG7_div\n    have h'' : card (Sylow 7 G) ≠ 1 := by\n      intro h1\n      rw [h1] at hG7_div\n      norm_num at hG7_div\n    norm_num at hG7_div\n  exact ⟨⟨Sylow.exists_subgroup_card_pow_prime h5 hG5_eq_21⟩, ⟨Sylow.exists_subgroup_card_pow_prime h7 hG7_eq_15⟩⟩\n```",False

Therefore, \( n_3 \) could be one of these values.\n\n2. **Sylow 17-subgroups**: The number of Sylow 17-subgroups, denoted \( n_{17} \), must divide 2907 and be congruent to 1 modulo 17.

First, let's break down the order of the group using its prime factorization. The number 462 can be factored as:\n\n\[ 462 = 2 \times 3 \times 7 \times 11. \]\n\nAccording to Sylow's theorems, for each prime factor \( p \) of the order of the group, there exists a Sylow \( p \)-subgroup, and the number of such subgroups, denoted \( n_p \), satisfies two conditions:\n1. \( n_p \equiv 1 \pmod{p} \).\n2. \( n_p \) divides the order of the group.\n\nLet's consider each prime factor:\n\n1. **Sylow 2-subgroups**: \n   - \( n_2 \equiv 1 \pmod{2} \) and \( n_2 \) divides 462.\n   - The divisors of 462 that are odd are 1, 3, 7, 11, 21, 33, 77, 231, and 462.\n   - So, \( n_2 \) could be 1, 3, 7, 11, 21, 33, 77, 231, or 462.\n\n2. **Sylow 3-subgroups**:\n   - \( n_3 \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \) and \( n_3 \) divides 462.\n   - The divisors of 462 that are congruent to 1 mod 3 are 1, 7, 11, 77, and 231.\n   - So, \( n_3 \) could be 1, 7, 11, 77, or 231.\n\n3. **Sylow 7-subgroups**:\n   - \( n_7 \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \) and \( n_7 \) divides 462.\n   - The divisors of 462 that are congruent to 1 mod 7 are 1, 3, 11, and 33.\n   - So, \( n_7 \) could be 1, 3, 11, or 33.\n\n4. **Sylow 11-subgroups**:\n   - \( n_{11} \equiv 1 \pmod{11} \) and \( n_{11} \) divides 462.\n   - The divisors of 462 that are congruent to 1 mod 11 are 1, 3, 7, and 21.\n   - So, \( n_{11} \) could be 1, 3, 7, or 21.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications of these numbers:\n\n- If any \( n_p = 1 \), then the corresponding Sylow \( p \)-subgroup is unique and hence normal in \( G \).

",0,1,2006,"# Informal Proof:\n\nTo prove that $P \cap H$ is the unique Sylow $p$-subgroup of $H$, we start by considering the given conditions: $P$ is a normal Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$, and $H$ is any subgroup of $G$.\n\nFirst, let's recall what it means for $P$ to be a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$. This means that $P$ is a maximal subgroup of $G$ whose order is a power of $p$, and the index of $P$ in $G$ is not divisible by $p$. Additionally, since $P$ is normal in $G$, it is invariant under conjugation by any element of $G$.\n\nNow, consider the intersection $P \cap H$. Since $P$ is a subgroup of $G$ and $H$ is a subgroup of $G$, their intersection $P \cap H$ is also a subgroup of $G$. More specifically, $P \cap H$ is a subgroup of both $P$ and $H$.\n\nSince $P$ is a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$, the order of $P$ is a power of $p$. Therefore, the order of $P \cap H$, being a subgroup of $P$, must also be a power of $p$. This means that $P \cap H$ is a $p$-subgroup of $H$.\n\nNext, we need to show that $P \cap H$ is not just any $p$-subgroup of $H$, but the unique Sylow $p$-subgroup of $H$. To do this, we use the fact that $P$ is normal in $G$. Because $P$ is normal, any conjugate of $P$ by an element of $G$ is still $P$. This property extends to subgroups of $P$, including $P \cap H$. Therefore, any conjugate of $P \cap H$ by an element of $H$ is still contained in $P$, and hence in $P \cap H$ itself.\n\nNow, suppose there is another Sylow $p$-subgroup $Q$ of $H$. By the Sylow theorems, any two Sylow $p$-subgroups of a group are conjugate to each other within that group. However, since $P \cap H$ is invariant under conjugation by elements of $H$ (as it is a subgroup of the normal subgroup $P$), $Q$ must be equal to $P \cap H$. This shows that $P \cap H$ is the unique Sylow $p$-subgroup of $H$.\n\nIn summary, $P \cap H$ is a $p$-subgroup of $H$ because it is a subgroup of the Sylow $p$-subgroup $P$. The normality of $P$ in $G$ ensures that $P \cap H$ is invariant under conjugation by elements of $H$, making it the unique Sylow $p$-subgroup of $H$.

An element \( u \) in a ring \( R \) is called a unit if there exists another element \( v \) in \( R \) such that \( u \cdot v = v \cdot u = 1 \), where \( 1 \) is the multiplicative identity in \( R \). The element \( v \) is called the inverse of \( u \), and we denote it by \( u^{-1} \).\n\nNow, let's consider the element \(-u\). We want to show that \(-u\) is also a unit, which means we need to find an element in \( R \) that, when multiplied by \(-u\), gives the multiplicative identity \( 1 \).\n\nSince \( u \) is a unit, we know there exists an element \( u^{-1} \) such that \( u \cdot u^{-1} = 1 \).

",0,1,21876,"# Informal Proof:\n\nTo prove that any subring of a field which contains the identity is an integral domain, we need to understand a few key concepts about fields, subrings, and integral domains.\n\nFirst, let's recall what a field is. A field is a set equipped with two operations, addition and multiplication, satisfying certain properties. Importantly, every non-zero element in a field has a multiplicative inverse, and the field has no zero divisors. This means that if you multiply two non-zero elements, the result is never zero.\n\nNow, consider a subring of a field. A subring is a subset of a ring that is itself a ring with the same operations. In this case, our subring is a subset of a field, and it contains the identity element of the field (usually denoted as 1). This is crucial because having the identity element ensures that the subring can potentially have multiplicative inverses for its elements.\n\nAn integral domain is a commutative ring with no zero divisors and a multiplicative identity. Since our subring is part of a field, it inherits the commutative property of multiplication from the field. Also, because the field has no zero divisors, any subring of the field will also have no zero divisors. This is because if there were zero divisors in the subring, they would also be zero divisors in the field, which contradicts the properties of a field.\n\nFinally, since the subring contains the identity element of the field, it satisfies the requirement of having a multiplicative identity. Therefore, the subring meets all the criteria for being an integral domain: it is a commutative ring, it has no zero divisors, and it contains a multiplicative identity.\n\nIn summary, any subring of a field that includes the identity element is an integral domain because it inherits the no zero divisors property from the field, is commutative, and contains the multiplicative identity.",```lean4\nimport Mathlib\n\nopen Fintype Subgroup Set Polynomial Ideal\nopen scoped BigOperators\n\n/-- Prove that any subring of a field which contains the identity is an integral domain.-/\ntheorem exercise_7_1_12 {F : Type*} [Field F] {K : Subring F}\n  (hK : (1 : F) ∈ K) : IsDomain K :=\n  inferInstance\n```,True

",0,3,75859,"# Informal Proof:\n\nTo show that the integral domain \( R \) is a Principal Ideal Domain (PID) under the given conditions, we need to demonstrate that every ideal in \( R \) is principal, meaning it can be generated by a single element.\n\nLet's start by considering the first condition: for any two nonzero elements \( a \) and \( b \) in \( R \), there exists a greatest common divisor (GCD) that can be expressed as a linear combination of \( a \) and \( b \). This condition is reminiscent of the property of Euclidean domains, where the GCD of two elements can be expressed in this way. This property is crucial because it implies that the ideal generated by \( a \) and \( b \), denoted \( \langle a, b \rangle \), is actually generated by their GCD. Thus, any ideal generated by two elements is principal.\n\nNow, let's consider the second condition: if we have a sequence of nonzero elements \( a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots \) in \( R \) such that each element divides the previous one (\( a_{i+1} \mid a_i \)), then there exists a positive integer \( N \) such that for all \( n \geq N \), \( a_n \) is a unit times \( a_N \). This condition ensures that any descending chain of ideals stabilizes, which is a key property of Noetherian rings. In a Noetherian ring, every ideal is finitely generated, and this condition specifically ensures that the chain condition on divisibility leads to stabilization, meaning the sequence eventually becomes constant up to multiplication by units.\n\nCombining these two conditions, we can argue that any ideal in \( R \) can be generated by a single element. Here's why: \n\n1. **Finite Generation of Ideals**: The second condition implies that any ideal in \( R \) is finitely generated because any infinite descending chain of ideals stabilizes. This is a characteristic of Noetherian rings.\n\n2. **Principal Generation**: The first condition ensures that any ideal generated by two elements can be reduced to a principal ideal. Since every ideal is finitely generated (from the second condition), we can apply the first condition repeatedly to reduce any finitely generated ideal to a principal ideal.\n\nTherefore, every ideal in \( R \) can be expressed as a principal ideal, satisfying the definition of a Principal Ideal Domain. Thus, under the given conditions, \( R \) is indeed a PID.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\n\nopen Fintype Subgroup Set Polynomial Ideal\nopen scoped BigOperators\n\ntheorem exercise_8_2_4 {R : Type*} [Ring R][NoZeroDivisors R]\n  [CancelCommMonoidWithZero R] [GCDMonoid R]\n  (h1 : ∀ a b : R, a ≠ 0 → b ≠ 0 → ∃ r s : R, gcd a b = r*a + s*b)\n  (h2 : ∀ a : ℕ → R, (∀ i j : ℕ, i < j → a i ∣ a j) →\n  ∃ N : ℕ, ∀ n ≥ N, ∃ u : R, IsUnit u ∧ a n = u * a N) :\n  IsPrincipalIdealRing R :=\nbegin\n  -- We need to show that every ideal in R is principal.\n  -- Given the conditions, we can use the properties of gcd and the sequence condition to show this.\n  -- First, let's consider any ideal I in R.\n  intro I,\n  -- Since R is a GCD monoid, we can use the first condition to find generators for any two elements in I.\n  -- The second condition ensures that any sequence of elements in I stabilizes, meaning there exists a point N\n  -- such that for all n ≥ N, the elements are units times a_N.\n  -- This implies that I can be generated by a single element, making it principal.\n  -- Therefore, we conclude that R is a Principal Ideal Domain.\n  exact IsPrincipalIdealRing.of_surjective_gcd h1 h2,\nend\n```",False

",0,1,132368,"# Informal Proof:\n\nTo show that the elements \(2\), \(\sqrt{-n}\), and \(1+\sqrt{-n}\) are irreducible in the ring \(R = \mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-n}]\), where \(n\) is a squarefree integer greater than 3, we need to demonstrate that each of these elements cannot be factored into a product of two non-unit elements in \(R\).\n\n### Step 1: Prove that 2 is irreducible in \(R\).\n\nFirst, consider the element \(2\). In the ring of integers \(\mathbb{Z}\), 2 is a prime number, which means it cannot be factored into a product of two non-unit integers. In the ring \(R = \mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-n}]\), the units are the elements with norm \(\pm 1\). The norm of an element \(a + b\sqrt{-n}\) in \(R\) is given by \(a^2 + nb^2\).\n\nFor \(2\) to be reducible, it would need to be expressible as a product of two non-unit elements in \(R\). Suppose \(2 = (a + b\sqrt{-n})(c + d\sqrt{-n})\). The norm of \(2\) is \(4\), and the norm of the product is \((a^2 + nb^2)(c^2 + nd^2)\). For this to equal 4, one of these norms must be 1, which would make one of the factors a unit. Therefore, \(2\) cannot be factored into non-units, making it irreducible.\n\n### Step 2: Prove that \(\sqrt{-n}\) is irreducible in \(R\).\n\nNext, consider \(\sqrt{-n}\). The norm of \(\sqrt{-n}\) is \(n\), since \((0)^2 + n(1)^2 = n\). For \(\sqrt{-n}\) to be reducible, it would need to be expressible as a product of two non-unit elements in \(R\). Suppose \(\sqrt{-n} = (a + b\sqrt{-n})(c + d\sqrt{-n})\). The norm of \(\sqrt{-n}\) is \(n\), and the norm of the product is \((a^2 + nb^2)(c^2 + nd^2)\). For this to equal \(n\), one of these norms must be 1, which would make one of the factors a unit. Therefore, \(\sqrt{-n}\) cannot be factored into non-units, making it irreducible.\n\n### Step 3: Prove that \(1+\sqrt{-n}\) is irreducible in \(R\).\n\nFinally, consider \(1+\sqrt{-n}\). The norm of \(1+\sqrt{-n}\) is \(1^2 + n(1)^2 = 1 + n\). For \(1+\sqrt{-n}\) to be reducible, it would need to be expressible as a product of two non-unit elements in \(R\). Suppose \(1+\sqrt{-n} = (a + b\sqrt{-n})(c + d\sqrt{-n})\). The norm of \(1+\sqrt{-n}\) is \(1 + n\), and the norm of the product is \((a^2 + nb^2)(c^2 + nd^2)\). For this to equal \(1 + n\), one of these norms must be 1, which would make one of the factors a unit. Therefore, \(1+\sqrt{-n}\) cannot be factored into non-units, making it irreducible.\n\nIn conclusion, each of the elements \(2\), \(\sqrt{-n}\), and \(1+\sqrt{-n}\) cannot be factored into a product of two non-unit elements in \(R\), thus proving they are irreducible.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\n\nopen Fintype Subgroup Set Polynomial Ideal\nopen scoped BigOperators\n\n/-- Let $R=\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-n}]$ where $n$ is a squarefree integer greater than 3.

",0,1,76131,"# Informal Proof:\n\nTo prove that the ring $\mathbb{Z}[x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots] / (x_1 x_2, x_3 x_4, x_5 x_6, \ldots)$ contains infinitely many minimal prime ideals, we need to understand the structure of this ring and how the ideals behave within it.\n\nFirst, let's consider the ring $\mathbb{Z}[x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots]$. This is a polynomial ring with countably infinite variables over the integers. The ideal $(x_1 x_2, x_3 x_4, x_5 x_6, \ldots)$ is generated by the products of pairs of consecutive variables. This means that any polynomial in this ideal can be expressed as a sum of terms, each of which is a multiple of one of these products.\n\nNow, when we take the quotient of $\mathbb{Z}[x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots]$ by this ideal, we are essentially setting each of these products to zero. This means that in the quotient ring, $x_1 x_2 = 0$, $x_3 x_4 = 0$, $x_5 x_6 = 0$, and so on.\n\nTo find minimal prime ideals in this quotient ring, we need to identify prime ideals that cannot be further reduced while still being prime. A prime ideal in a ring is an ideal such that if a product of two elements is in the ideal, then at least one of those elements must be in the ideal.\n\nConsider the ideal $(x_1)$ in the quotient ring. This ideal is prime because if a product $fg$ is in $(x_1)$, then either $f$ or $g$ must be in $(x_1)$, given that $x_1 x_2 = 0$ in the quotient. Similarly, the ideal $(x_2)$ is also prime for the same reason.

",0,1,76644,"# Informal Proof:\n\nTo prove that the polynomial \(x^2 - \sqrt{2}\) is irreducible over \(\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{2}]\), we need to show that it cannot be factored into polynomials of lower degree with coefficients in \(\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{2}]\).\n\nFirst, let's understand what \(\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{2}]\) is. It consists of all numbers of the form \(a + b\sqrt{2}\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are integers. This set is a unique factorization domain (UFD), meaning every element can be factored uniquely into irreducible elements, similar to how integers can be factored into prime numbers.\n\nNow, consider the polynomial \(x^2 - \sqrt{2}\). If it were reducible over \(\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{2}]\), it could be expressed as a product of two linear polynomials with coefficients in \(\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{2}]\). Let's assume it can be factored as \((x - (a + b\sqrt{2}))(x - (c + d\sqrt{2}))\), where \(a, b, c,\) and \(d\) are integers.\n\nExpanding this product, we get:\n\[\nx^2 - (a + b\sqrt{2} + c + d\sqrt{2})x + (a + b\sqrt{2})(c + d\sqrt{2})\n\]\n\nFor this to equal \(x^2 - \sqrt{2}\), the constant term \((a + b\sqrt{2})(c + d\sqrt{2})\) must equal \(-\sqrt{2}\). Let's explore this condition:\n\n1. The product \((a + b\sqrt{2})(c + d\sqrt{2})\) expands to:\n   \[\n   ac + (ad + bc)\sqrt{2} + 2bd\n   \]\n\n   For this to equal \(-\sqrt{2}\), we need:\n   - \(ac + 2bd = 0\) (the integer part)\n   - \(ad + bc = -1\) (the \(\sqrt{2}\) part)\n\n2. Solving these equations simultaneously is quite restrictive. The first equation \(ac + 2bd = 0\) suggests that the integer part of the product is zero, which is a strong condition given that \(a, b, c,\) and \(d\) are integers.\n\n3. The second equation \(ad + bc = -1\) implies that the sum of products involving \(\sqrt{2}\) must be exactly \(-1\), which is also a very specific requirement.\n\nGiven these constraints, finding integer solutions for \(a, b, c,\) and \(d\) that satisfy both equations is highly unlikely.

",0,3,109960,"# Informal Proof:\n\nTo determine whether the collection \(\mathcal{T}_\infty = \{U \mid X - U \text{ is infinite or empty or all of } X\}\) forms a topology on the set \(X\), we need to check if it satisfies the three basic properties of a topology: it must include the empty set and the entire set \(X\), it must be closed under arbitrary unions, and it must be closed under finite intersections.\n\n1. **Contains the Empty Set and the Entire Set:**\n   - The empty set \(\emptyset\) is in \(\mathcal{T}_\infty\) because \(X - \emptyset = X\), which is all of \(X\).\n   - The entire set \(X\) is in \(\mathcal{T}_\infty\) because \(X - X = \emptyset\), which is empty.\n\n2. **Closed Under Arbitrary Unions:**\n   - Consider a collection of sets \(\{U_i\}_{i \in I}\) where each \(U_i \in \mathcal{T}_\infty\). We need to check if \(\bigcup_{i \in I} U_i \in \mathcal{T}_\infty\).\n   - For each \(U_i\), \(X - U_i\) is either infinite, empty, or all of \(X\).\n   - However, the complement of the union, \(X - \bigcup_{i \in I} U_i = \bigcap_{i \in I} (X - U_i)\), may not be infinite, empty, or all of \(X\). For example, if each \(X - U_i\) is infinite, their intersection could be finite or even empty, which does not satisfy the condition for \(\mathcal{T}_\infty\).\n   - Therefore, \(\mathcal{T}_\infty\) is not necessarily closed under arbitrary unions.\n\n3. **Closed Under Finite Intersections:**\n   - Consider two sets \(U_1, U_2 \in \mathcal{T}_\infty\). We need to check if \(U_1 \cap U_2 \in \mathcal{T}_\infty\).\n   - The complement of the intersection, \(X - (U_1 \cap U_2) = (X - U_1) \cup (X - U_2)\), must be infinite, empty, or all of \(X\).\n   - If \(X - U_1\) and \(X - U_2\) are both infinite, their union is also infinite, satisfying the condition.\n   - However, if one of them is empty and the other is infinite, the union is infinite, which is fine.

",0,1,93504,"# Informal Proof:\n\nTo show that the collection of intervals $\{(a, b) \mid a < b, a \text{ and } b \text{ rational}\}$ forms a basis for the standard topology on $\mathbb{R}$, we need to demonstrate that any open set in the standard topology can be expressed as a union of these intervals.\n\nFirst, let's recall what it means for a collection of sets to be a basis for a topology. A collection of sets is a basis if every open set in the topology can be written as a union of sets from this collection. In the standard topology on $\mathbb{R}$, open sets are unions of open intervals of the form $(c, d)$ where $c < d$ and $c, d \in \mathbb{R}$.\n\nNow, consider any open interval $(c, d)$ in $\mathbb{R}$. We want to show that this interval can be covered by a union of intervals of the form $(a, b)$ where $a$ and $b$ are rational numbers. The key idea here is to use the fact that rational numbers are dense in the real numbers.

",0,1,13085,"# Informal Proof:\n\nTo show that the space $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$ with the dictionary order topology is metrizable, we need to demonstrate that there exists a metric (a way to measure distance) that induces the same topology as the dictionary order topology on this space.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the dictionary order topology is. When we consider $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$, we can think of it as pairs of real numbers, like coordinates on a plane. The dictionary order is similar to how words are ordered in a dictionary: we first compare the first elements of the pairs, and if they are equal, we then compare the second elements. So, for two pairs $(a, b)$ and $(c, d)$, $(a, b) < (c, d)$ if either $a < c$, or $a = c$ and $b < d$.\n\nNow, for a space to be metrizable, it must have a topology that can be described by a metric. A key property of metrizable spaces is that they are second-countable, meaning they have a countable basis for their topology.

Since our index set is countable, \( D \) is countable.\n\nNext, we need to show that \( D \) is dense in the product space. To do this, we use the basis for the product topology. A basic open set in the product topology is of the form \( U = \prod_{\alpha} U_\alpha \), where \( U_\alpha \) is open in \( S_\alpha \) and for all but finitely many \( \alpha \), \( U_\alpha = S_\alpha \).\n\nFor \( D \) to be dense, every basic open set \( U \) must intersect \( D \). Since each \( D_\alpha \) is dense in \( S_\alpha \), for each \( \alpha \), the intersection \( U_\alpha \cap D_\alpha \) is non-empty. We can choose an element \( x_\alpha \) from each \( U_\alpha \cap D_\alpha \).\n\nThe tuple \( (x_\alpha) \) formed by these choices is in both \( U \) and \( D \), showing that \( U \cap D \neq \emptyset \). Since this holds for any basic open set \( U \), \( D \) is dense in the product space.\n\nThus, we have shown that the countable product of spaces, each with a countable dense subset, also has a countable dense subset, making the product space separable.\nPrevious attempt failed with: type mismatch\n  s ×ˢ t\nhas type\n  Set (X 0 × X 1) : outParam (Type u_1)\nbut is expected to have type\n  Set ((i : ℕ) → X i) : Type u_1\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: type mismatch\n  s i\nhas type\n  Set (X i) : Type u_1\nbut is expected to have type\n  (i : ℕ) → X i : Type u_1\nunknown constant 'Filter.mem_dense_iff'\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, equality or iff proof expected\n  ?m.3795\ncase h.right\nX : ℕ → Type u_1\ninst✝ : (i : ℕ) → TopologicalSpace (X i)\ns : (i : ℕ) → Set (X i)\nhs : ∀ (i : ℕ), Countable ↑(s i) ∧ Dense (s i)\nx : (i : ℕ) → X i\n⊢ x ∈ closure (range fun i => sorryAx ((i : ℕ) → X i) true)\nPlease revise the proof.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\n\nopen Filter Set TopologicalSpace\nopen scoped Topology\n\n/-- Show that if $X$ is a countable product of spaces having countable dense subsets, then $X$ has a countable dense subset.-/\n\ntheorem exercise_30_10\n  {X : ℕ → Type*} [∀ i, TopologicalSpace (X i)]\n  (h : ∀ i, ∃ (s : Set (X i)), Countable s ∧ Dense s) :\n  ∃ (s : Set (Π i, X i)), Countable s ∧ Dense s := by\n  choose s hs using h\n  use {x | ∀ i, x i ∈ s i}\n  constructor\n  · exact countable_pi (fun i => (hs i).1)\n  · intro x\n    rw [mem_closure_iff_nhds]\n    intro t ht\n    rw [Filter.mem_pi] at ht\n    choose f hf using ht\n    use fun i => f i (mem_range_self i)\n    constructor\n    · intro i\n      exact hf i (mem_range_self i)\n    · exact mem_of_mem_nhds ht\n```",False

This completes the proof that every locally compact Hausdorff space is indeed completely regular.\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  LocallyCompactSpace.local_compact_nhds x (𝓝 x)\nargument\n  𝓝 x\nhas type\n  Filter X : Type u_1\nbut is expected to have type\n  Set X : Type u_1\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  LocallyCompactSpace.local_compact_nhds x (𝓝 x)\nargument\n  𝓝 x\nhas type\n  Filter X : Type u_1\nbut is expected to have type\n  Set X : Type u_1\nPlease revise the proof.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\n\nopen Filter Set TopologicalSpace\nopen scoped Topology\n\nabbrev I : Set ℝ := Icc 0 1\n\n/-- Show that every locally compact Hausdorff space is completely regular.-/\ntheorem exercise_33_7 {X : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X]\n  (hX : LocallyCompactSpace X) (hX' : T2Space X) :\n  ∀ x A, IsClosed A ∧ ¬ x ∈ A →\n  ∃ (f : X → I), Continuous f ∧ f x = 1 ∧ f '' A = {0} := by\n  intro x A hA\n  have hA' : IsClosed A := hA.1\n  have hxA : x ∉ A := hA.2\n  -- Since X is locally compact, there exists a compact neighborhood K of x\n  obtain ⟨K, hK, hxK, hKc⟩ := hX.local_compact_nhds x (𝓝 x)\n  -- Since X is Hausdorff, we can separate x and A by open sets\n  obtain ⟨U, V, hU, hV, hxU, hAV, hUV⟩ := hX'.t2_separation hA' hxA\n  -- We can assume K ⊆ U\n  have hKU : K ⊆ U := by\n    apply hK.subset_of_nhdsWithin_ne_bot\n    rw [nhdsWithin_eq_bot_iff]\n    exact hUV.symm.trans (inter_comm _ _)\n  -- Define f : X → I by f(y) = 0 if y ∈ V and f(y) = 1 if y ∈ K\n  let f : X → I := fun y => if y ∈ V then 0 else 1\n  use f\n  -- f is continuous\n  have hf : Continuous f := by\n    apply continuous_if_const\n    · intro y hy\n      exact ⟨hV, hU, hKU, hAV, hUV⟩\n    · exact continuous_const\n    · exact continuous_const\n  -- f x = 1\n  have hfx : f x = 1 := by\n    rw [if_neg]\n    exact hxA\n  -- f '' A = {0}\n  have hfA : f '' A = {0} := by\n    ext z\n    simp only [mem_image, mem_singleton_iff]\n    constructor\n    · rintro ⟨y, hyA, hy⟩\n      rw [if_neg] at hy\n      exact hy\n      exact hyA\n    · intro hz\n      use x\n      exact ⟨hA.2, hfx.symm.trans hz⟩\n  exact ⟨hf, hfx, hfA⟩\n```",False

Our goal is to construct a metric on \( X \) that is compatible with the topology of \( X \).\n\n### Step-by-Step Construction:\n\n- **Step 1: Define a Metric on \( X_1 \cup X_2 \)**: Since \( X_1 \) and \( X_2 \) are closed in \( X \), they are also compact (as closed subsets of a compact space). We can use the metrics \( d_1 \) and \( d_2 \) to define a new metric on \( X_1 \cup X_2 \).\n\n- **Step 2: Use the Metrizability of \( X_1 \) and \( X_2 \)**: For points within \( X_1 \), use the metric \( d_1 \), and for points within \( X_2 \), use the metric \( d_2 \). The challenge is to define a metric for points where one is in \( X_1 \) and the other is in \( X_2 \).\n\n- **Step 3: Construct a Combined Metric**: We can define a metric \( d \) on \( X \) by considering the following:\n  \[\n  d(x, y) = \n  \begin{cases} \n  d_1(x, y) & \text{if } x, y \in X_1, \\\n  d_2(x, y) & \text{if } x, y \in X_2, \\\n  \inf \{ d_1(x, z) + d_2(z, y) \mid z \in X_1 \cap X_2 \} & \text{if } x \in X_1, y \in X_2 \text{ or vice versa}.\n  \end{cases}\n  \]\n  This metric \( d \) respects the topology of \( X \) because it combines the metrics on \( X_1 \) and \( X_2 \) and smoothly handles the transition between these two spaces.\n\n- **Step 4: Verify the Metric Properties**: We need to check that \( d \) satisfies the properties of a metric: non-negativity, identity of indiscernibles, symmetry, and the triangle inequality.

exercise_43_2,"/-- Let $(X, d_X)$ and $(Y, d_Y)$ be metric spaces; let $Y$ be complete. Let $A \subset X$. Show that if $f \colon A \rightarrow Y$ is uniformly continuous, then $f$ can be uniquely extended to a continuous function $g \colon \bar{A} \rightarrow Y$, and $g$ is uniformly continuous.-/
",0,1,96411,"# Informal Proof:\n\nTo tackle this problem, we need to show that a uniformly continuous function \( f \) defined on a subset \( A \) of a metric space \( X \) can be uniquely extended to a continuous function \( g \) on the closure of \( A \), denoted \( \bar{A} \), and that this extension \( g \) is also uniformly continuous.\n\nLet's break this down step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding Uniform Continuity**: A function \( f: A \to Y \) is uniformly continuous if, for any small positive distance \( \epsilon \), there exists a small positive distance \( \delta \) such that whenever two points in \( A \) are within \( \delta \) of each other, their images under \( f \) are within \( \epsilon \) of each other. This property is stronger than regular continuity because \( \delta \) depends only on \( \epsilon \) and not on the specific points in \( A \).\n\n2. **Closure of \( A \)**: The closure \( \bar{A} \) of a set \( A \) in a metric space \( X \) includes all the points in \( A \) plus any limit points of sequences from \( A \). This means that if you have a sequence of points from \( A \) that converges to some point \( a \), then \( a \) is in \( \bar{A} \).\n\n3. **Constructing the Extension \( g \)**: To extend \( f \) to \( \bar{A} \), we need to define \( g \) at each point \( a \in \bar{A} \). If \( a \) is already in \( A \), we simply set \( g(a) = f(a) \). For points \( a \) in \( \bar{A} \setminus A \), we use the fact that \( a \) is a limit of some sequence \( \{a_n\} \) from \( A \). Since \( f \) is uniformly continuous, the sequence \( \{f(a_n)\} \) in \( Y \) will converge to some limit in \( Y \) because \( Y \) is complete. We define \( g(a) \) to be this limit.\n\n4. **Uniqueness of the Extension**: To ensure that this extension is unique, we need to show that the limit of \( \{f(a_n)\} \) is the same regardless of the sequence \( \{a_n\} \) chosen, as long as \( a_n \to a \). Uniform continuity of \( f \) ensures that any two sequences converging to the same limit point \( a \) will have their images under \( f \) converging to the same point in \( Y \).\n\n5. **Continuity of \( g \)**: The function \( g \) is continuous on \( \bar{A} \) because for any sequence \( \{a_n\} \) in \( \bar{A} \) converging to a point \( a \), the sequence \( \{g(a_n)\} \) will converge to \( g(a) \). This follows from how we defined \( g \) using limits of sequences.\n\n6. **Uniform Continuity of \( g \)**: Finally, \( g \) is uniformly continuous on \( \bar{A} \) because the uniform continuity of \( f \) on \( A \) extends to \( \bar{A} \). The same \( \delta \) that works for \( f \) on \( A \) will work for \( g \) on \( \bar{A} \) due to the way limits and closures work in metric spaces.\n\nIn summary, by using the properties of uniform continuity and the completeness of \( Y \), we can extend \( f \) to a unique continuous and uniformly continuous function \( g \) on the closure \( \bar{A} \). This extension is well-defined and behaves nicely due to the structure of metric spaces and the completeness of \( Y \).","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\n\nopen Filter Set TopologicalSpace\nopen scoped Topology\n\ntheorem exercise_43_2 {X : Type*} [MetricSpace X]\n  {Y : Type*} [MetricSpace Y] [CompleteSpace Y] (A : Set X)\n  (f : X → Y) (hf : UniformContinuousOn f A) :\n  ∃!

If \( a \) is already in \( A \), we simply set \( g(a) = f(a) \).

",0,3,35653,"# Informal Proof:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two numbers \( a^{2^n} + 1 \) and \( a^{2^m} + 1 \) where \( n > m \). The result will depend on whether \( a \) is odd or even.\n\nLet's start by considering the case where \( a \) is odd. When \( a \) is odd, \( a^k \) is also odd for any positive integer \( k \). Therefore, both \( a^{2^n} \) and \( a^{2^m} \) are odd, and adding 1 to each makes them even. Thus, both \( a^{2^n} + 1 \) and \( a^{2^m} + 1 \) are even numbers.\n\nNow, let's explore the GCD of these two even numbers. Since both numbers are even, their GCD is at least 2. To see if it could be greater than 2, consider the expression for the GCD:\n\n\[\n\gcd(a^{2^n} + 1, a^{2^m} + 1) = \gcd(a^{2^m} + 1, (a^{2^n} + 1) - (a^{2^m} + 1))\n\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\[\n\gcd(a^{2^m} + 1, a^{2^n} - a^{2^m})\n\]\n\nNotice that \( a^{2^n} - a^{2^m} = a^{2^m}(a^{2^n - 2^m} - 1) \). Since \( n > m \), \( 2^n - 2^m \) is positive, and \( a^{2^m} \) is odd (because \( a \) is odd), the expression \( a^{2^m}(a^{2^n - 2^m} - 1) \) is odd. Therefore, the GCD of \( a^{2^m} + 1 \) and \( a^{2^n} - a^{2^m} \) is 2, as both terms are even and no higher power of 2 divides both.\n\nNow, consider the case where \( a \) is even. If \( a \) is even, then \( a^{2^n} \) and \( a^{2^m} \) are both even, making \( a^{2^n} + 1 \) and \( a^{2^m} + 1 \) odd numbers. The GCD of two odd numbers is 1, because odd numbers cannot share any even factor.\n\nIn summary, the GCD of \( a^{2^n} + 1 \) and \( a^{2^m} + 1 \) is 2 if \( a \) is odd, and 1 if \( a \) is even.

exercise_3_4,"/-- Show that the equation $3 x^{2}+2=y^{2}$ has no solution in integers.-/
",0,1,47787,"# Informal Proof:\n\nTo show that the equation \(3x^2 + 2 = y^2\) has no solution in integers, let's analyze the structure of the equation and the properties of integers.\n\nFirst, consider the equation \(3x^2 + 2 = y^2\). This can be rearranged to \(y^2 - 3x^2 = 2\). This is a type of Diophantine equation known as a Pell-like equation, but with a constant term that is not zero.\n\nLet's examine the parity (odd or even nature) of the terms involved. If \(x\) is even, then \(x = 2k\) for some integer \(k\), and \(3x^2 = 3(2k)^2 = 12k^2\), which is even. Adding 2 to an even number results in another even number, so \(3x^2 + 2\) is even. For \(y^2\) to be even, \(y\) must also be even, say \(y = 2m\). Then \(y^2 = (2m)^2 = 4m^2\), which is also even. So, if \(x\) is even, \(y\) must be even.\n\nNow, consider if \(x\) is odd, say \(x = 2k + 1\). Then \(3x^2 = 3(2k + 1)^2 = 3(4k^2 + 4k + 1) = 12k^2 + 12k + 3\), which is odd. Adding 2 to an odd number results in an odd number, so \(3x^2 + 2\) is odd. For \(y^2\) to be odd, \(y\) must be odd, say \(y = 2m + 1\). Then \(y^2 = (2m + 1)^2 = 4m^2 + 4m + 1\), which is odd. So, if \(x\) is odd, \(y\) must be odd.\n\nNext, let's consider the equation modulo 3. If \(x\) is an integer, then \(x^2 \equiv 0, 1 \pmod{3}\). Therefore, \(3x^2 \equiv 0 \pmod{3}\).

A number \( a \) is a primitive root modulo \( p \) if the smallest positive integer \( k \) such that \( a^k \equiv 1 \pmod{p} \) is \( k = p-1 \). In other words, \( a \) generates all the non-zero residues modulo \( p \).\n\nNow, consider the prime \( p = 4t + 1 \). This form is significant because it implies that \( p-1 = 4t \), which is divisible by 4.

This means that the powers of \( a \) generate all the non-zero residues modulo \( p \). We need to show that \(-a\) also generates all these residues.\n\nConsider the order of \(-a\) modulo \( p \).

We want to show that this order is \( p-1 \).\n\nNotice that:\n\[\n(-a)^{p-1} = (-1)^{p-1} \cdot a^{p-1}\n\]\n\nSince \( p \) is an odd prime, \( p-1 \) is even, so \((-1)^{p-1} = 1\). Also, because \( a \) is a primitive root, \( a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{p} \). Therefore:\n\[\n(-a)^{p-1} \equiv 1 \cdot 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{p}\n\]\n\nThis shows that the order of \(-a\) divides \( p-1 \). However, we need to ensure that the order is exactly \( p-1 \) to confirm that \(-a\) is a primitive root.\n\nTo do this, consider the possibility that the order of \(-a\) is a proper divisor of \( p-1 \). The divisors of \( p-1 = 4t \) are \( 1, 2, 4, \ldots \). If the order were less than \( p-1 \), say \( 2t \), then:\n\[\n(-a)^{2t} \equiv 1 \pmod{p}\n\]\n\nThis would imply:\n\[\na^{2t} \equiv (-1)^{2t} \equiv 1 \pmod{p}\n\]\n\nBut since \( a \) is a primitive root, the smallest power for which \( a^k \equiv 1 \pmod{p} \) is \( k = p-1 \), not \( 2t \). Therefore, the order of \(-a\) cannot be \( 2t \) or any other proper divisor of \( p-1 \).\n\nThus, the order of \(-a\) must be \( p-1 \), confirming that \(-a\) is indeed a primitive root modulo \( p \).\n\nConversely, if \(-a\) is a primitive root, a similar argument shows that \( a \) must also be a primitive root, completing the proof.\n\nIn summary, for a prime \( p = 4t + 1 \), \( a \) is a primitive root modulo \( p \) if and only if \(-a\) is a primitive root modulo \( p \).","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\n\nopen Real\nopen scoped BigOperators\n\n/-- Consider a prime $p$ of the form $4 t+1$.

",0,1,6007,"# Informal Proof:\n\nTo tackle this problem, we need to understand the behavior of the sum of powers modulo a prime number \( p \). Specifically, we are interested in the sum \( 1^k + 2^k + \cdots + (p-1)^k \) and how it behaves under modulo \( p \) conditions, depending on whether \( p-1 \) divides \( k \) or not.\n\nFirst, let's consider the case where \( p-1 \nmid k \). In this scenario, we can use a result from number theory known as Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that for any integer \( a \) not divisible by \( p \), \( a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{p} \). This implies that the powers of integers modulo \( p \) have a periodicity of \( p-1 \).\n\nNow, if \( p-1 \nmid k \), then \( k \) is not a multiple of \( p-1 \), and the sum \( 1^k + 2^k + \cdots + (p-1)^k \) can be thought of as a sum of a complete set of residues raised to the power \( k \). Due to the symmetry and periodicity properties of powers modulo \( p \), this sum will be congruent to zero modulo \( p \). This is because the residues \( 1, 2, \ldots, p-1 \) form a complete residue system modulo \( p \), and their powers will distribute evenly across the possible residues, effectively canceling each other out.\n\nNext, consider the case where \( p-1 \mid k \). Here, \( k \) is a multiple of \( p-1 \), say \( k = m(p-1) \) for some integer \( m \). In this case, each term in the sum \( 1^k, 2^k, \ldots, (p-1)^k \) simplifies to \( 1^{m(p-1)}, 2^{m(p-1)}, \ldots, (p-1)^{m(p-1)} \). By Fermat's Little Theorem, each of these terms is congruent to 1 modulo \( p \), because raising any non-zero integer to the power of \( p-1 \) results in 1 modulo \( p \).\n\nThus, the sum becomes \( 1 + 1 + \cdots + 1 \) (a total of \( p-1 \) times), which equals \( p-1 \). Since \( p-1 \equiv -1 \pmod{p} \), the sum \( 1^k + 2^k + \cdots + (p-1)^k \equiv -1 \pmod{p} \) when \( p-1 \mid k \).\n\nIn summary, the behavior of the sum \( 1^k + 2^k + \cdots + (p-1)^k \) modulo \( p \) depends on whether \( k \) is a multiple of \( p-1 \). If \( p-1 \nmid k \), the sum is congruent to 0 modulo \( p \). If \( p-1 \mid k \), the sum is congruent to \(-1\) modulo \( p \).

This means we are looking for an integer \( x \) such that when \( x^4 \) is divided by \( p \), the remainder is 2. For this to be possible, 2 must be a fourth power residue modulo \( p \).\n\n### Step 2: Connection to Fermat's Two Squares Theorem\n\nFermat's Two Squares Theorem tells us that a prime \( p \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \) can be expressed as the sum of two squares, \( p = a^2 + b^2 \).

The presence of 64 suggests a deeper connection to the structure of numbers and their residues.\n\n### Step 4: Using Quadratic Reciprocity and Descent\n\nTo show the equivalence, we can use the idea of descent, similar to the proof of Fermat's Two Squares Theorem.

This implies that \( x^4 \equiv 2 \) is a fourth power residue, which is a stronger condition than being a simple quadratic residue.\n\nThe descent method involves finding a smaller representation of \( p \) in terms of squares, eventually leading to the form \( A^2 + 64B^2 \). The presence of 64 suggests that the descent involves scaling one of the terms by 8, which is consistent with the structure of fourth powers.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\n\nThus, the problem boils down to showing that the existence of a solution to \( x^4 \equiv 2 \pmod{p} \) implies a specific form of representation of \( p \) as \( A^2 + 64B^2 \), and vice versa.

An algebraic number is any number that satisfies such a polynomial equation.\n\nFirst, let's recall that \(\pi/12\) is equivalent to \(15^\circ\) in degrees.

This is because, as \( f \) transitions from increasing to non-increasing behavior, the derivatives must change sign, indicating a point where \( f^{(n)}(x) < 0 \).\n\nIn conclusion, the conditions \( f(0) = 0 \), \( f(1) = 1 \), and \( f(x) \geq 0 \) for all \( x \) ensure that \( f \) must have a point where a higher-order derivative is negative, confirming the existence of such an \( n \) and \( x \).\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\n\nopen scoped BigOperators\n\n/-- Let $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be an infinitely differentiable function satisfying $f(0)=0, f(1)=1$, and $f(x) \geq 0$ for all $x \in$ $\mathbb{R}$.

Our goal is to show that \( f'(x) < 2f(x) \) for all \( x \).\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Derivatives:**\n   - Since \( f'''(x) \leq f(x) \), this implies that the rate of change of the concavity (as given by the third derivative) is bounded above by the function itself. This suggests that the function is not becoming more concave too quickly.\n   - The positivity of \( f''(x) \) indicates that \( f \) is convex, meaning the slope of \( f \) (i.e., \( f'(x) \)) is increasing.\n\n2. **Implications of \( f'''(x) \leq f(x) \):**\n   - The condition \( f'''(x) \leq f(x) \) suggests a control over how rapidly the convexity of \( f \) can increase. Since \( f'''(x) \) is the derivative of \( f''(x) \), it means that the rate at which the slope \( f'(x) \) is increasing is not too fast compared to the value of the function itself.\n\n3. **Analyzing \( f'(x) < 2f(x) \):**\n   - We want to show that the slope of the function \( f \) is less than twice the value of the function at any point. This can be interpreted as saying that the function grows at a rate that is not too steep compared to its current value.\n   - Given that \( f'(x) \) is increasing (since \( f''(x) > 0 \)), we need to ensure that this increase is controlled enough to satisfy \( f'(x) < 2f(x) \).\n\n4. **Using the Positivity of Derivatives:**\n   - Since all derivatives are positive, \( f(x) \) is increasing, \( f'(x) \) is increasing, and \( f''(x) \) is increasing. This means \( f \) is growing, and its growth rate is also increasing.\n   - However, the condition \( f'''(x) \leq f(x) \) ensures that the increase in the growth rate (i.e., the increase in \( f'(x) \)) is not too rapid.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The condition \( f'''(x) \leq f(x) \) effectively acts as a constraint that prevents \( f'(x) \) from growing too quickly relative to \( f(x) \). This constraint, combined with the positivity of all derivatives, ensures that \( f'(x) \) remains less than \( 2f(x) \).\n   - Therefore, the function's growth is controlled in such a way that the slope \( f'(x) \) is always less than twice the function value \( f(x) \), satisfying the required inequality.\n\nIn summary, the interplay between the positivity of the derivatives and the constraint \( f'''(x) \leq f(x) \) ensures that the function's growth is moderated, leading to the conclusion that \( f'(x) < 2f(x) \) for all \( x \).\nPrevious attempt failed with: linarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase h\nf : ℝ → ℝ\nhf : ContDiff ℝ 3 f\nhf1 : ∀ n ≤ 3, ∀ (x : ℝ), iteratedDeriv n f x > 0\nhf2 : ∀ (x : ℝ), iteratedDeriv 3 f x ≤ f x\nx : ℝ\nh1 : 0 < iteratedDeriv 0 f x\nh2 : 0 < iteratedDeriv 1 f x\nh3 : 0 < iteratedDeriv 2 f x\nh4 : 0 < iteratedDeriv 3 f x\nh5 : iteratedDeriv 3 f x ≤ f x\na✝ : deriv f x ≥ 2 * f x\n⊢ False\nfailed\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: linarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase h\nf : ℝ → ℝ\nhf : ContDiff ℝ 3 f\nhf1 : ∀ n ≤ 3, ∀ (x : ℝ), iteratedDeriv n f x > 0\nhf2 : ∀ (x : ℝ), iteratedDeriv 3 f x ≤ f x\nx : ℝ\nh1 : 0 < iteratedDeriv 0 f x\nh2 : 0 < iteratedDeriv 1 f x\nh3 : 0 < iteratedDeriv 2 f x\nh4 : 0 < iteratedDeriv 3 f x\nh5 : iteratedDeriv 3 f x ≤ f x\na✝ : deriv f x ≥ 2 * f x\n⊢ False\nfailed\nPlease revise the proof.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\n\nopen scoped BigOperators\n\ntheorem exercise_1999_b4 (f : ℝ → ℝ) (hf: ContDiff ℝ 3 f)\n  (hf1 : ∀ n ≤ 3, ∀ x : ℝ, iteratedDeriv n f x > 0)\n  (hf2 : ∀ x : ℝ, iteratedDeriv 3 f x ≤ f x) :\n  ∀ x : ℝ, deriv f x < 2 * f x :=\nbegin\n  intro x,\n  have h1 : 0 < iteratedDeriv 0 f x := hf1 0 (by norm_num) x,\n  have h2 : 0 < iteratedDeriv 1 f x := hf1 1 (by norm_num) x,\n  have h3 : 0 < iteratedDeriv 2 f x := hf1 2 (by norm_num) x,\n  have h4 : 0 < iteratedDeriv 3 f x := hf1 3 (by norm_num) x,\n  have h5 : iteratedDeriv 3 f x ≤ f x := hf2 x,\n  by_contradiction h,\n  push_neg at h,\n  have h6 : deriv f x ≥ 2 * f x := h,\n  linarith [h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6],\nend\n```",False

",0,1,51174,"# Informal Proof:\n\nTo tackle this problem, we need to show that for any integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\), there exists a positive integer \(n\) such that \(\sqrt{n^3 + an^2 + bn + c}\) is not an integer. Essentially, we are looking for a value of \(n\) that makes the expression inside the square root not a perfect square.\n\nLet's start by considering the expression \(n^3 + an^2 + bn + c\). As \(n\) becomes very large, the term \(n^3\) will dominate the expression because it grows much faster than the other terms. This means that for large \(n\), the expression \(n^3 + an^2 + bn + c\) is approximately \(n^3\).\n\nNow, if \(\sqrt{n^3 + an^2 + bn + c}\) were to be an integer, say \(k\), then we would have:\n\n\[ k^2 = n^3 + an^2 + bn + c. \]\n\nFor large \(n\), since \(n^3\) is the dominant term, \(k^2\) would be approximately equal to \(n^3\). This implies that \(k\) would be approximately equal to \(n^{3/2}\).\n\nHowever, let's consider the nature of perfect squares. For a number to be a perfect square, it must be exactly equal to some integer squared. The expression \(n^3 + an^2 + bn + c\) is a polynomial of degree 3, and as \(n\) increases, the difference between \(n^3\) and the next perfect square becomes significant. Specifically, the gaps between consecutive perfect squares grow larger as the numbers themselves grow larger.\n\nTherefore, for sufficiently large \(n\), the expression \(n^3 + an^2 + bn + c\) will not be exactly a perfect square because the additional terms \(an^2 + bn + c\) will cause it to fall between two perfect squares. This is because the difference between \(n^3\) and the next perfect square is larger than the sum of the terms \(an^2 + bn + c\) for large \(n\).\n\nThus, there will always be some positive integer \(n\) such that \(\sqrt{n^3 + an^2 + bn + c}\) is not an integer, as the expression will not be a perfect square for sufficiently large \(n\). This completes the informal proof.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\n\nopen scoped BigOperators\n\ntheorem exercise_1998_b6 (a b c : ℤ) :\n  ∃ n : ℤ, n > 0 ∧ ¬ ∃ m : ℤ, Real.sqrt (n^3 + a*n^2 + b*n + c) = m :=\n  by\n  use 1\n  constructor\n  norm_num\n  intro h\n  obtain ⟨m, hm⟩ := h\n  norm_num at hm\n  have : (1 : ℝ) = m := by\n    rw [← hm]\n    ring\n  norm_num at this\n  linarith\n```",False
