Polynomial functions are well-known for their smoothness and lack of breaks or jumps; they are continuous everywhere in their domain. Specifically:\n\n1. The term \\( x^2y \\) involves multiplying \\( x^2 \\) (which is continuous for all real \\( x \\)) by \\( y \\) (also continuous for all real \\( y \\)). The product of continuous functions remains continuous.\n2. Similarly, the term \\( -3xy^2 \\) is a product of \\( x \\), \\( y^2 \\), and a constant \\(-3\\). Each of these individual parts is continuous, and multiplying by a constant does not affect continuity.\n3. The constant term \\( +5 \\) is trivially continuous since it does not change with \\( x \\) or \\( y \\).\n\nSince each of these components is continuous and the sum of continuous functions is also continuous, the entire function \\( f(x, y) \\) inherits this continuity. Therefore, at the specific point \\((1, 2)\\), there are no abrupt changes or discontinuities in \\( f(x, y) \\).

The student studies at a rate of 3 pages per hour, and each page has an independent probability of 0.8 of being remembered. Since he studies 3 pages, the possible number of pages he can remember ranges from 0 to 3.\n\n2. **Modeling the Probability:**\n   \n   The number of pages the student remembers follows a **binomial distribution** with parameters \\( n = 3 \\) (number of pages) and \\( p = 0.8 \\) (probability of remembering each page). The probability mass function for a binomial distribution gives the probability of remembering exactly \\( k \\) pages:\n   \\[\n   P(X = k) = \\binom{3}{k} (0.8)^k (0.2)^{3-k}\n   \\]\n   \n   Consequently, \\( f(x) = P(X \\geq x) \\) sums the probabilities of remembering \\( x \\) or more pages.\n\n3. **Formulating \\( f(x) \\):**\n   \n   Given that \\( x \\) can only be an integer between 0 and 3, \\( f(x) \\) is a **step function**:\n   - For \\( x \\leq 0 \\), \\( f(x) = 1 \\) (since remembering at least 0 pages is certain).\n   - For \\( 1 \\leq x < 2 \\), \\( f(x) = P(X \\geq 1) \\).\n   - For \\( 2 \\leq x < 3 \\), \\( f(x) = P(X \\geq 2) \\).\n   - For \\( x \\geq 3 \\), \\( f(x) = P(X \\geq 3) \\).\n\n4. **Analyzing the Derivative:**\n   \n   - **At \\( x = 3 \\):**\n     \n     Since \\( f(x) \\) is a step function, its derivative at any integer point like \\( x = 3 \\) isn\u2019t defined in the traditional sense because of the sudden jump. However, if we approximate \\( f(x) \\) as a continuous function around \\( x = 3 \\), the slope just before \\( x = 3 \\) can be considered.\n   \n   - **Assuming a Continuous Approximation:**\n     \n     If we treat \\( f(x) \\) as a decreasing linear function (which is a simplification for the sake of differentiation), the rate at which the probability decreases with respect to \\( x \\) would be constant. Given that each additional page increases the chance of not remembering, the slope (or derivative) reflects this change.\n\n5. **Determining the Constant Derivative:**\n   \n   The probability of remembering each additional page decreases by the probability of forgetting it, which is \\( 0.2 \\) (since \\( 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 \\)). However, since the student studies 3 pages per hour, the overall rate at which the probability decreases with each additional page is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Derivative} = -0.8\n   \\]\n   The negative sign indicates that as \\( x \\) increases, the probability \\( f(x) \\) decreases.\n\n6. **Concluding the Answers:**\n   \n   1. The derivative of \\( f(x) \\) at \\( x = 3 \\) is \\( -0.8 \\).\n   \n   2. Since the rate at which the probability decreases is consistent for each additional page, the derivative of \\( f(x) \\) is a constant value of \\( -0.8 \\) across its domain.",

Since \\( f(a) \\) and \\( f(b) \\) have the same value, the function starts and ends at the same height.

Thus, any point \\( c \\) in \\((a, b)\\) satisfies \\( f'(c) = 0 \\).\n\n2. **Non-Constant Function Case:** If \\( f(x) \\) is not constant, it must have either a highest point (a local maximum) or a lowest point (a local minimum) somewhere between \\( a \\) and \\( b \\). At such a peak or trough, the slope of the function changes direction. \n\n   - **At a Local Maximum:** The function increases up to the maximum point and then decreases.

One of the key properties of the exponential function \\( e^x \\) is that its first derivative with respect to \\( x \\) is the same as the function itself. That is, the rate at which \\( y \\) changes as \\( x \\) increases is exactly \\( e^x \\). Mathematically, this means:\n\\[\ny' = \\frac{dy}{dx} = e^x\n\\]\n\nNow, let's find the second derivative, which is the derivative of the first derivative. Since the first derivative \\( y' \\) is also \\( e^x \\), taking the derivative of \\( y' \\) gives us:\n\\[\ny'' = \\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = e^x\n\\]\n\nWith both the first and second derivatives determined, we can substitute \\( y \\), \\( y' \\), and \\( y'' \\) back into the original differential equation:\n\\[\ny'' - y' - 2y = e^x - e^x - 2e^x\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the right-hand side:\n\\[\ne^x - e^x = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 0 - 2e^x = -2e^x\n\\]\n\\[\n0 - 2e^x = -2e^x\n\\]\n\nHowever, upon closer examination, there seems to be a miscalculation. Let's correct that:\n\nSubstituting the derivatives into the equation:\n\\[\ny'' - y' - 2y = e^x - e^x - 2e^x = (e^x - e^x) - 2e^x = 0 - 2e^x = -2e^x\n\\]\n\nThis result, \\( -2e^x \\), does not equal zero, which suggests that \\( y = e^x \\) is **not** a solution to the differential equation \\( y'' - y' - 2y = 0 \\).\n\nHowever, if we reassess the original problem, it's clear there was a mistake in the substitution. Let's try the process again carefully:\n\nSubstitute \\( y = e^x \\) into the equation:\n\\[\ny'' - y' - 2y = e^x - e^x - 2e^x\n\\]\n\\[\n= (e^x - e^x) - 2e^x\n\\]\n\\[\n= 0 - 2e^x\n\\]\n\\[\n= -2e^x\n\\]\n\nSince \\( -2e^x \\) does not equal zero, this indicates that \\( y = e^x \\) does not satisfy the differential equation \\( y'' - y' - 2y = 0 \\). Therefore, \\( y = e^x \\) is **not** a solution to this equation.\n\n*Note: Upon re-evaluating the steps, it's clear that there was an initial oversight in the substitution process leading to an incorrect conclusion. The correct verification shows that \\( y = e^x \\) does not satisfy the given differential equation.*\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.exp', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.exp', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.exp', and it does not have executable code\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.exp', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.exp', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.exp', and it does not have executable code\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.exp', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.exp', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.exp', and it does not have executable code\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

The divergence \\( \\nabla \\cdot F \\) at a point measures the net rate at which the vector field \\( F \\) is \"spreading out\" from that point. If the divergence is positive at a point, it means there's a net \"source\" of the field there\u2014more of the field is flowing outward than inward. Conversely, a negative divergence indicates a \"sink,\" where more field is flowing inward than outward.\n\nIn our problem, we're given that the divergence of \\( F \\) is zero everywhere within the solid region \\( D \\):\n\\[\n\\nabla \\cdot F = f_{1_x} + f_{2_y} + f_{3_z} = 0\n\\]\nThis condition implies that, within the entire region \\( D \\), there are no net sources or sinks of the vector field \\( F \\). In other words, whatever amount of the field flows into any part of \\( D \\) must exactly balance the amount flowing out.\n\nNow, consider the boundary surface \\( S \\) of the region \\( D \\), which is oriented by outward-pointing unit normal vectors \\( n \\). The flux \\( \\int\\int_S F \\cdot n \\, dS \\) represents the total amount of the vector field \\( F \\) passing outward through the surface \\( S \\).\n\nSince the divergence inside \\( D \\) is zero, there are no net sources or sinks within \\( D \\) to create an imbalance between the incoming and outgoing flux across \\( S \\). Any portion of \\( F \\) that flows into \\( D \\) must be matched by an equal portion flowing out, ensuring that the total outward flux equals the total inward flux.\n\nMathematically, this relationship is formalized by the Divergence Theorem, which states:\n\\[\n\\int\\int_S F \\cdot n \\, dS = \\int\\int\\int_D \\nabla \\cdot F \\, dV\n\\]\nGiven that \\( \\nabla \\cdot F = 0 \\) throughout \\( D \\), the right side of the equation becomes zero:\n\\[\n\\int\\int_S F \\cdot n \\, dS = 0\n\\]\nTherefore, the total flux of \\( F \\) across the boundary surface \\( S \\) is zero.\n\nIn summary, because the divergence of \\( F \\) is zero within the region \\( D \\), there are no net sources or sinks of \\( F \\) inside \\( D \\).

We'll call this original price \\( P \\).\n\n1. **Increasing the Price by 20%:**\n   - John decides to increase the price of the books by 20% for a sale event.\n   - To calculate the new price after a 20% increase, we multiply the original price \\( P \\) by 1.20 (which represents a 100% original price plus the additional 20%).\n   - So, the increased price becomes:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Increased Price} = P \\times 1.20 = 1.20P\n     \\]\n\n2. **Decreasing the Increased Price by 20%:**\n   - After the sale event, John wants to return the book prices to their original value. To do this, he decreases the **increased price** by 20%.\n   - To find the final price after a 20% decrease, we multiply the increased price \\( 1.20P \\) by 0.80 (which represents retaining 80% of the increased price after a 20% reduction).\n   - So, the final price becomes:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Final Price} = 1.20P \\times 0.80 = 0.96P\n     \\]\n\n3. **Comparing the Final Price to the Original Price:**\n   - The original price was \\( P \\), and after these adjustments, the final price is \\( 0.96P \\).\n   - To find out how much the final price differs from the original price, we look at the difference:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Difference from Original} = P - 0.96P = 0.04P\n     \\]\n   - This means the final price is 4% less than the original price.\n\n4. **Calculating the Percentage Difference Between the Increased Price and the Final Price:**\n   - The increased price was \\( 1.20P \\), and the final price is \\( 0.96P \\).\n   - The difference between these two prices is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Difference} = 1.20P - 0.96P = 0.24P\n     \\]\n   - To find the percentage difference relative to the increased price, we divide the difference by the increased price and multiply by 100:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Percentage Difference} = \\left( \\frac{0.24P}{1.20P} \\right) \\times 100 = 20\\%\n     \\]\n   \n**Conclusion:**\nAfter increasing the book prices by 20% and then decreasing the increased prices by 20%, the final price ends up being 20% less than the increased price.

The derivative of a constant term is zero.\n\nApplying these rules to each term in \\( f(z) \\):\n\n- The derivative of \\( z^2 \\) is \\( 2z \\).\n- The derivative of \\( 2z \\) is \\( 2 \\).\n- The derivative of the constant \\( 1 \\) is \\( 0 \\).\n\nAdding these up, the derivative of the function \\( f(z) \\) is:\n\\[ f'(z) = 2z + 2 \\]\n\nNow, we substitute the given value \\( z = 3 + 4i \\) into the derivative:\n\n\\[\nf'(3 + 4i) = 2(3 + 4i) + 2 = 6 + 8i + 2 = 8 + 8i\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the derivative of the function \\( f(z) \\) at the point \\( z = 3 + 4i \\) is \\( 8 + 8i \\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'calc'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'calc'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'calc'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

This equation tells us that the rate at which \\( y \\) changes with respect to \\( x \\) is directly proportional to the current value of \\( y \\), with \\( k \\) being the proportionality constant.\n\nThink about functions where the derivative is proportional to the function itself. The exponential function is a prime example of such a function. Specifically, the derivative of \\( e^{kx} \\) with respect to \\( x \\) is \\( k e^{kx} \\), which means it satisfies the equation \\( \\frac{d}{dx}e^{kx} = ke^{kx} \\).\n\nRecognizing this property, we infer that any function whose derivative is proportional to itself must involve an exponential function. Therefore, the general solution to our differential equation must be some constant multiple of \\( e^{kx} \\).

Since the function f is continuous and differentiable everywhere with its derivative equal to itself (f\u2009\u2032(x) = f(x)), we know that f has properties similar to the exponential function.\n\n2. **Finding the Slope of the Tangent Line:**\n   The slope of the tangent line to the curve at any point is given by the derivative of the function defining the curve. Here, the second component of \u03b3(t) is f(t), so the slope of the tangent line at the point (t, f(t)) is f\u2009\u2032(t). Given that f\u2009\u2032(t) = f(t), the slope of the tangent line is f(t).\n\n3. **Using the Point-Slope Form of a Line:**\n   With the slope identified as f(t) and knowing that the tangent line passes through the point (t, f(t)), we can use the point-slope form of a linear equation to express the tangent line. The point-slope form is:\n   \\[\n   y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\n   \\]\n   Substituting the known values:\n   - \\( m = f(t) \\) (the slope)\n   - \\( (x_1, y_1) = (t, f(t)) \\) (the point of tangency)\n   \n   This gives:\n   \\[\n   y - f(t) = f(t)(x - t)\n   \\]\n\n4. **Simplifying the Equation:**\n   To express the equation in a more familiar form, we can rearrange the terms:\n   \\[\n   y = f(t)(x - t) + f(t)\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   y = f(t) \\cdot (x - t) + f(t)\n   \\]\n   which is the desired equation of the tangent line.\n\nTherefore, by identifying the slope of the tangent using the derivative and applying the point-slope formula, we have shown that the tangent line to the curve \u03b3 at the point (t, f(t)) is indeed given by:\n\\[\ny = f(t) \\cdot (x - t) + f(t)\n\\]",

Recall that a perfect square trinomial has the form \\( (px + q)^2 = p^2x^2 + 2pqx + q^2 \\). Comparing this to our equation:\n\n- The coefficient of \\( x^2 \\) is \\( a^2 \\), which suggests \\( p = a \\).\n- The constant term is \\( b^2 \\), corresponding to \\( q^2 \\), so \\( q = b \\).\n- The middle term should be \\( 2pqx \\). Plugging in \\( p = a \\) and \\( q = b \\), we get \\( 2abx \\).\n\nHowever, in our equation, the middle term is \\( -2abx \\) instead of \\( +2abx \\). This indicates that the perfect square should actually be \\( (ax - b)^2 \\), since:\n\n\\[\n(ax - b)^2 = a^2x^2 - 2abx + b^2\n\\]\n\nThis matches our original equation exactly. Therefore, the equation can be rewritten as:\n\n\\[\n(ax - b)^2 = 0\n\\]\n\nFor this squared expression to equal zero, the term inside the square must itself be zero:\n\n\\[\nax - b = 0\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\), we find:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{b}{a}\n\\]\n\nSince the equation reduces to a single solution \\( x = \\frac{b}{a} \\), it means that the quadratic equation has a repeated root at this value of \\( x \\). In other words, both solutions of the equation are the same, resulting in a single, repeated root.\n\nAlternatively, we can look at the discriminant of the quadratic equation, which determines the nature of its roots. The standard form of a quadratic equation is \\( Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0 \\), and its discriminant \\( D \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\nD = B^2 - 4AC\n\\]\n\nFor our equation:\n\n- \\( A = a^2 \\)\n- \\( B = -2ab \\)\n- \\( C = b^2 \\)\n\nPlugging these into the discriminant formula:\n\n\\[\nD = (-2ab)^2 - 4(a^2)(b^2) = 4a^2b^2 - 4a^2b^2 = 0\n\\]\n\nA discriminant of zero indicates that the quadratic equation has exactly one real root, or a repeated root. This confirms our earlier conclusion that \\( x = \\frac{b}{a} \\) is the repeated root of the equation.\n\nThus, for any real numbers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), the quadratic equation \\( (a^2)x^2 - 2abx + b^2 = 0 \\) indeed has a repeated root.\nPrevious attempt failed with: simp made no progress\nunexpected token 'at'; expected command\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: simp made no progress\nunexpected token 'at'; expected command\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: simp made no progress\nPlease revise the proof.",

For the polynomial to have real roots, it would need to dip below the x-axis somewhere between these points. However, all evaluated points are positive, and the overall trend suggests that the polynomial remains above the x-axis.\n\n4. **Minimum Value Consideration**: To have real roots, the polynomial must attain a value of zero, which would require its minimum value to be at or below zero. Given that \\( f(x) \\) is always positive at the tested points and tends to positive infinity at the extremes, the minimum value of \\( f(x) \\) must also be positive. This means there's no point where \\( f(x) \\) equals zero.\n\nSince the polynomial \\( f(x) \\) remains positive for all real values of \\( x \\) and does not cross the x-axis, we can conclude that it has no real roots.

When we take a random sample of size n from this population and calculate the sample mean, denoted by X\u0304, this sample mean itself is a random variable. The distribution of X\u0304 has its own probability density function (pdf), which describes how the probabilities are spread around different possible values of X\u0304.\n\nThe mean of the sampling distribution of X\u0304 is also \u03bc, and its spread is characterized by a standard deviation of \u03c3 divided by the square root of the sample size, n. This means that \u03bc is the central point around which the values of X\u0304 are most likely to cluster.\n\nNow, to understand the behavior of the pdf of X\u0304 around \u03bc, think about how probabilities are distributed.

At this peak, the slope of the pdf changes direction\u2014from increasing to decreasing\u2014as you move through \u03bc. \n\nMathematically, the slope of the pdf at any point is given by its derivative with respect to X\u0304.

However, one player is injured and cannot participate, leaving 14 eligible players. The coach needs to select 11 players out of these 14. This is a classic combination problem, where the order of selection doesn't matter. The number of ways to choose 11 players from 14 is given by the combination formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of ways} = \\binom{14}{11}\n\\]\n\nThis can also be calculated as \\(\\binom{14}{3}\\) since choosing 11 players out of 14 is equivalent to leaving out 3 players.\n\nNext, we address the second part of the problem regarding the rate of change of the number of different teams the coach can choose during the game. The game lasts 90 minutes, and the coach decides to change the players every 10 minutes. This means that substitutions occur at the 10-minute marks: 10, 20, 30, ..., up to 90 minutes. \n\nBetween these substitution times, the set of players on the field remains constant, so the number of different teams the coach can choose does not change during these intervals. Therefore, the rate at which the number of different teams changes is zero during each of these periods. Since substitutions happen every 10 minutes over a 90-minute game, there are 9 intervals (from 0 to 10 minutes, 10 to 20 minutes, ..., up to 80 to 90 minutes) where the team composition\u2014and thus the number of different possible teams\u2014remains unchanged. \n\nIn summary, the coach can choose the 11 players in \\(\\binom{14}{11}\\) different ways, and the rate at which the number of different teams changes is zero during each of the 9 intervals between substitutions.",

Let's denote angle A as the angle opposite side BC (which has length 7), angle B opposite side AC (length 8), and angle C opposite side AB (length 5).\n\nThe Law of Sines states that the ratio of the length of a side to the sine of its opposite angle is the same for all three sides of the triangle. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n\\[ \\frac{a}{\\sin A} = \\frac{b}{\\sin B} = \\frac{c}{\\sin C} \\]\nwhere \\( a, b, c \\) are the lengths of the sides opposite angles A, B, and C, respectively.\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for sin\u202fA:\n\\[ \\sin A = \\frac{a}{2R} \\]\nwhere \\( R \\) is the radius of the circumcircle of the triangle. However, calculating \\( R \\) directly might be cumbersome, so instead, we'll use the relationship between the sides and angles more directly.\n\nTo find sin\u202fA without knowing the angles explicitly, we can use the Law of Cosines to first find the cosine of angle A.

On each of these tiny intervals, we can approximate the area under the curve by drawing a rectangle. The height of each rectangle can be determined by the value of the function \\( f \\) at a specific point within the subinterval\u2014this could be the left endpoint, the right endpoint, the midpoint, or any other point, depending on the method of approximation we choose.\n\nBy summing up the areas of all these rectangles, we obtain an approximation of the total area under the curve between \\( a \\) and \\( b \\). The key idea here is that as we make these subintervals smaller and smaller\u2014meaning we increase the number of rectangles and decrease their width\u2014the approximation becomes more accurate. In the limit, as the width of the subintervals approaches zero (and thus their number approaches infinity), the sum of the areas of these rectangles converges to the exact area under the curve.\n\nSince the function \\( f \\) is continuous on \\([a, b]\\), there are no abrupt jumps or gaps in the curve, ensuring that our approximation improves uniformly across the entire interval as we refine our partitioning. This process of taking finer and finer partitions and summing the corresponding rectangle areas is precisely what the definite integral formalizes.\n\nTherefore, by understanding that the definite integral represents the limit of these increasingly accurate approximations of the area under \\( f \\), we conclude that the exact area \\( A \\) under the curve from \\( a \\) to \\( b \\) is indeed given by the definite integral \\( \\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \\, dx \\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: function expected at\n  Icc\nterm has type\n  ?m.386\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: function expected at\n  Area\nterm has type\n  ?m.244\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.measureSpace', and it does not have executable code\nPlease revise the proof.",

This gives us a central point around which the values of \\(X\\) are distributed.\n\nThe **variance** \\(Var(X)\\) measures how much the values of \\(X\\) deviate from this mean \\(\\mu\\). By definition, the variance is calculated as the expected value of the squared deviations of \\(X\\) from its mean. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n\\[\nVar(X) = E\\left[(X - \\mu)^2\\right]\n\\]\nHere\u2019s why this holds true:\n\n1. **Expansion of the Squared Term**:\n   Consider the expression \\((X - \\mu)^2\\). Expanding this, we get:\n   \\[\n   (X - \\mu)^2 = X^2 - 2\\mu X + \\mu^2\n   \\]\n\n2. **Applying Linearity of Expectation**:\n   The expectation operator \\(E\\) is linear, meaning it distributes over addition and can factor out constants. Applying \\(E\\) to both sides of the expanded equation:\n   \\[\n   E\\left[(X - \\mu)^2\\right] = E(X^2) - 2\\mu E(X) + E(\\mu^2)\n   \\]\n   Simplifying further:\n   \\[\n   E(X^2) - 2\\mu^2 + \\mu^2 = E(X^2) - \\mu^2\n   \\]\n   (Since \\(E(X) = \\mu\\) and \\(E(\\mu^2) = \\mu^2\\) because \\(\\mu\\) is a constant.)\n\n3. **Relating Back to Variance**:\n   The variance \\(Var(X)\\) is also defined as:\n   \\[\n   Var(X) = E(X^2) - (E(X))^2 = E(X^2) - \\mu^2\n   \\]\n   Comparing this with our earlier result:\n   \\[\n   E\\left[(X - \\mu)^2\\right] = Var(X)\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Conclusion**:\n   Therefore, the expected value of the squared deviation \\((X - \\mu)^2\\) is precisely the variance \\(\\sigma^2\\) of the random variable \\(X\\). This shows that:\n   \\[\n   E\\left[(X - \\mu)^2\\right] = \\sigma^2\n   \\]\n   \nThis completes the proof, demonstrating that the expectation of \\((X - \\mu)^2\\) indeed equals the variance \\(\\sigma^2\\) of \\(X\\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: expected token\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: function expected at\n  E\nterm has type\n  ?m.1129\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: function expected at\n  E\nterm has type\n  ?m.1129\nPlease revise the proof.",

In this case, triangles ABC and DEF are similar, and the ratio of their corresponding sides is given by AB/DE = BC/EF = AC/DF = k. This ratio k indicates how much larger or smaller one triangle is compared to the other.\n\nNow, the area of a triangle is calculated using the formula \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}\\). If we consider that not only the sides but also the heights of the similar triangles are scaled by the same factor k, then both the base and the height of triangle ABC are k times the corresponding base and height of triangle DEF.\n\nSince both the base and the height are multiplied by k, the area of triangle ABC becomes \\(k \\times \\text{base}\\) times \\(k \\times \\text{height}\\), which is \\(k^2 \\times (\\text{base} \\times \\text{height})\\).

This means that the behavior of \\( f \\) around the point \\( a \\) can be fully understood by examining how \\( f \\) changes in the directions of each of these basis vectors.\n\nThe function \\( f: V \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R} \\) is given to be differentiable at the point \\( a \\). Differentiability implies that there is a well-defined linear approximation to \\( f \\) near \\( a \\), and this linear approximation is captured by the gradient of \\( f \\) at \\( a \\), denoted by \\( \\nabla f(a) \\).

The problem states that each of these directional derivatives is equal to the \\( i \\)-th component of a given vector \\( w \\) in \\( V \\).

The fact that they are parallel ensures that the distance between them remains constant everywhere, which is given as 10 units.\n\nNext, consider the line EF that connects a point E on AB to a point F on CD. The slope of EF is given as -0.5. To understand the relationship between EF and the parallel lines AB and CD, we can look at the product of their slopes. The slope of AB is 2, and the slope of EF is -0.5. Multiplying these together gives:\n\n\\[ 2 \\times (-0.5) = -1 \\]\n\nWhen the product of the slopes of two lines is -1, it indicates that the lines are perpendicular to each other. Therefore, EF is perpendicular to both AB and CD.\n\nSince EF is perpendicular to the parallel lines AB and CD, it serves as the shortest path connecting them. In other words, EF directly measures the perpendicular distance between AB and CD. Given that this distance is 10 units, the length of EF must also be 10 units.\n\nThus, by understanding the slopes and their relationship, we conclude that the length of line EF is 10 units.\nPrevious attempt failed with: no goals to be solved\nPlease revise the proof.",

To find this angle, we can use basic trigonometry. Imagine drawing a line from the apex directly down to the midpoint of the base, effectively splitting the isosceles triangle into two right-angled triangles. Each of these right triangles will have:\n\n- An adjacent side (height) of length \\(h\\).\n- An opposite side (half the base) of length \\(r\\).\n\nThe angle we're interested in is half of the apex angle, so let's call this smaller angle \\(\\theta\\).

Suppose \\( y_1(x) \\) and \\( y_2(x) \\) are two solutions to this equation on the interval \\( I \\).\n\nWe want to examine the behavior of the Wronskian \\( W(y_1, y_2) = y_1 y_2' - y_2 y_1' \\) on \\( I \\). The Wronskian is a determinant that helps us understand whether the two solutions \\( y_1 \\) and \\( y_2 \\) are linearly independent.\n\nTo explore this, let's differentiate the Wronskian with respect to \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\nW' = \\frac{d}{dx}(y_1 y_2' - y_2 y_1') = y_1' y_2' + y_1 y_2'' - y_2' y_1' - y_2 y_1''\n\\]\n\nSimplifying, we find:\n\n\\[\nW' = y_1 y_2'' - y_2 y_1''\n\\]\n\nNow, since both \\( y_1 \\) and \\( y_2 \\) are solutions to the differential equation, we can substitute \\( y'' \\) from the original equation:\n\n\\[\ny'' = -p(x)y' - q(x)y\n\\]\n\nApplying this to both \\( y_1'' \\) and \\( y_2'' \\):\n\n\\[\nW' = y_1 (-p(x)y_2' - q(x)y_2) - y_2 (-p(x)y_1' - q(x)y_1)\n\\]\n\nExpanding the terms:\n\n\\[\nW' = -p(x)y_1 y_2' - q(x)y_1 y_2 + p(x)y_2 y_1' + q(x)y_2 y_1\n\\]\n\nNotice that the \\( q(x) \\) terms cancel out:\n\n\\[\nW' = -p(x)y_1 y_2' + p(x)y_2 y_1' = -p(x)(y_1 y_2' - y_2 y_1') = -p(x)W\n\\]\n\nSo, we've derived a simple first-order differential equation for the Wronskian:\n\n\\[\nW' = -p(x)W\n\\]\n\nThis equation tells us how the Wronskian changes with \\( x \\). To understand its implications, consider the following scenarios:\n\n1. **If the Wronskian is zero at some point in \\( I \\):**\n   Suppose \\( W(x_0) = 0 \\) for some \\( x_0 \\) in \\( I \\). The differential equation \\( W' = -p(x)W \\) becomes \\( W' = 0 \\) at \\( x_0 \\), meaning the derivative of \\( W \\) is zero there. Because the equation is linear and \\( W = 0 \\) is a solution, the uniqueness theorem for differential equations tells us that if \\( W \\) is zero at one point and satisfies this equation, it must be zero everywhere on \\( I \\).\n\n2. **If the Wronskian is non-zero at some point in \\( I \\):**\n   Suppose \\( W(x_0) \\neq 0 \\) for some \\( x_0 \\) in \\( I \\). Since \\( p(x) \\) is continuous, the solution to the differential equation \\( W' = -p(x)W \\) will never cross zero.

We are given that this series converges absolutely for all real numbers \\( x \\) in the interval \\( (-R, R) \\), meaning that the sum of the absolute values \\( \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} |a_n x^n| \\) is finite within this interval.\n\n2. **Uniform Convergence Implications:**\n   Absolute convergence on \\( (-R, R) \\) implies uniform convergence on any smaller closed interval within \\( (-R, R) \\). Uniform convergence is a powerful property because it allows us to interchange limits with other operations, such as differentiation. This interchangeability is crucial for differentiating the series term by term.\n\n3. **Differentiating Term by Term:**\n   To find the derivative \\( f'(x) \\), we consider differentiating each term of the series individually:\n   \\[\n   f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n x^n \\right) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{d}{dx} (a_n x^n)\n   \\]\n   Since differentiation is a linear operation, we can move the derivative inside the sum.\n\n4. **Calculating the Derivative of Each Term:**\n   Differentiating each term \\( a_n x^n \\) with respect to \\( x \\) yields:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dx} (a_n x^n) = n a_n x^{n-1}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the differentiated series becomes:\n   \\[\n   f'(x) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} n a_n x^{n-1}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Simplifying the Series:**\n   Notice that when \\( n = 0 \\), the term \\( 0 \\cdot a_0 x^{-1} \\) equals zero. This means the first term of the differentiated series does not contribute anything to the sum. As a result, we can start the summation from \\( n = 1 \\) instead of \\( n = 0 \\):\n   \\[\n   f'(x) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} n a_n x^{n-1}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Conclusion Within the Interval of Convergence:**\n   Since the original series converges absolutely and uniformly on \\( (-R, R) \\), the differentiated series \\( \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} n a_n x^{n-1} \\) also converges within this interval. This ensures that the operation of differentiating term by term is valid, and thus:\n   \\[\n   f'(x) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} n a_n x^{n-1} \\quad \\text{for all } x \\in (-R, R)\n   \\]\n   \nTherefore, we have successfully shown that within the interval \\( (-R, R) \\), the derivative of the function \\( f(x) \\) is equal to the series formed by differentiating each term of the original power series individually.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

Typically, the side opposite the right angle is the hypotenuse.\n\n2. **Given Information:**\n   - The sine of angle A is 0.5.\n   - The length of side BC (opposite angle A) is 10 units.\n   - We need to find the length of side AB, which is opposite angle C and, in this configuration, acts as the hypotenuse.\n\n3. **Applying the Sine Function:**\n   - The sine of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the hypotenuse.\n   - Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n     \\[\n     \\sin(A) = \\frac{\\text{Opposite side}}{\\text{Hypotenuse}} = \\frac{BC}{AB}\n     \\]\n   - Plugging in the known values:\n     \\[\n     0.5 = \\frac{10}{AB}\n     \\]\n   - Solving for AB:\n     \\[\n     AB = \\frac{10}{0.5} = 20\n     \\]\n\n4. **Determining the Length of AB:**\n   - From the calculation, AB is found to be 20 units long.\n   - The problem also states that AB must be an integer, and 20 satisfies this condition.\n\n5. **Assessing the Hypothesis:**\n   - The hypothesis to test is whether AB is less than or equal to 5.\n   - Our calculation shows that AB is 20, which is significantly greater than 5.\n   - Since AB cannot be less than or equal to 5 based on the given information and our calculation, we have sufficient evidence to reject the hypothesis.\n\n6. **Significance Level Consideration:**\n   - A significance level of 0.05 indicates that there's only a 5% chance of rejecting the hypothesis when it's actually true.\n   - In this case, the difference between the calculated AB (20) and the hypothesized maximum of 5 is substantial.\n   - Therefore, at the 0.05 significance level, we confidently reject the hypothesis that AB is less than or equal to 5.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the given information and mathematical reasoning, the length of side AB is 20 units, and we can reject the hypothesis that AB is less than or equal to 5 with high confidence.\nPrevious attempt failed with: invalid binder annotation, type is not a class instance\n  ?m.14\nuse the command `set_option checkBinderAnnotations false` to disable the check\nfunction expected at\n  angle\nterm has type\n  x\u271d\u00b9\nfunction expected at\n  length\nterm has type\n  x\u271d\nfunction expected at\n  length\nterm has type\n  x\u271d\nunknown identifier 'sin_of_right_triangle'\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\nunknown constant 'Real.arcsin'\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'let'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\nunknown identifier 'begin'\ntype of theorem 'right_triangle_length_AB' is not a proposition\n  \u211d\nunexpected token 'let'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nunknown identifier 'begin'\ntype of theorem 'reject_hypothesis_AB_leq_5' is not a proposition\n  Bool\nunexpected token 'let'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

Therefore, the length can be expressed as \\( 2w + 3 \\) units.\n\n2. **Understand the Perimeter:**\n   - The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding up all its sides. Since a rectangle has two lengths and two widths, the perimeter \\( P \\) is given by:\n     \\[\n     P = 2 \\times (\\text{length} + \\text{width})\n     \\]\n   - We know the perimeter is 36 units, so plugging in the known values:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times ((2w + 3) + w) = 36\n     \\]\n\n3. **Simplify the Equation:**\n   - Combine like terms inside the parentheses:\n     \\[\n     (2w + 3) + w = 3w + 3\n     \\]\n   - The equation now looks like:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times (3w + 3) = 36\n     \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\( w \\):**\n   - Divide both sides of the equation by 2 to simplify:\n     \\[\n     3w + 3 = 18\n     \\]\n   - Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \\( w \\):\n     \\[\n     3w = 15\n     \\]\n   - Finally, divide both sides by 3 to find the width:\n     \\[\n     w = 5\n     \\]\n     So, the width of the rectangle is **5 units**.\n\n5. **Find the Length:**\n   - Recall that the length is \\( 2w + 3 \\). Substitute \\( w = 5 \\) into this expression:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Length} = 2 \\times 5 + 3 = 10 + 3 = 13\n     \\]\n     Therefore, the length of the rectangle is **13 units**.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The rectangle has a width of 5 units and a length of 13 units.

This results in a new set \\( A' = \\{k a_1, k a_2, \\ldots, k a_n\\} \\), effectively scaling \\( x \\) to \\( kx \\).\n\n3. **Impact on Covariance:**\n   Covariance measures how two variables change together. If we scale \\( x \\) by \\( k \\), the covariance between the new \\( x' = kx \\) and \\( y \\) becomes:\n   \\[\n   \\text{cov}(k x, y) = k \\cdot \\text{cov}(x, y)\n   \\]\n   This is because covariance is linear with respect to scaling one variable.\n\n4. **Impact on Variance:**\n   Variance measures how much a single variable varies. Scaling \\( x \\) by \\( k \\) affects its variance as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{var}(k x) = k^2 \\cdot \\text{var}(x)\n   \\]\n   Variance increases by the square of the scaling factor since it involves squaring the deviations from the mean.\n\n5. **New Slope Calculation:**\n   The slope \\( m_{\\text{new}} \\) of the regression line after scaling becomes:\n   \\[\n   m_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{\\text{cov}(k x, y)}{\\text{var}(k x)} = \\frac{k \\cdot \\text{cov}(x, y)}{k^2 \\cdot \\text{var}(x)} = \\frac{\\text{cov}(x, y)}{k \\cdot \\text{var}(x)} = \\frac{m}{k}\n   \\]\n   So, the new slope \\( m_{\\text{new}} \\) is the original slope \\( m \\) divided by the scaling factor \\( k \\).\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   Therefore, when every value in the independent variable \\( x \\) is multiplied by a constant factor \\( k \\), the slope of the regression line becomes \\( m_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{m}{k} \\). This means that the slope decreases by a factor of \\( k \\) when \\( x \\) is scaled by \\( k \\).\n\n**Note:** The original statement suggested that \\( m_{\\text{new}} = k \\cdot m \\). However, as shown, scaling the independent variable \\( x \\) by \\( k \\) results in the slope being divided by \\( k \\), not multiplied. If instead the dependent variable \\( y \\) were scaled by \\( k \\), then the slope would indeed be multiplied by \\( k \\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  cov A\nargument\n  A\nhas type\n  Set \u211d : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u211d : Type\napplication type mismatch\n  var A\nargument\n  A\nhas type\n  Set \u211d : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u211d : Type\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\napplication type mismatch\n  cov scaled_A\nargument\n  scaled_A\nhas type\n  Set \u211d \u2192 \u211d \u2192 Set \u211d : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u211d : Type\napplication type mismatch\n  var scaled_A\nargument\n  scaled_A\nhas type\n  Set \u211d \u2192 \u211d \u2192 Set \u211d : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u211d : Type\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to synthesize\n  HMul \u211d ((\u211d \u2192 \u211d \u2192 \u211d) \u2192 (\u211d \u2192 \u211d) \u2192 \u211d) ?m.5473\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\napplication type mismatch\n  scaled_x x\nargument\n  x\nhas type\n  \u211d \u2192 \u211d : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u211d : Type\napplication type mismatch\n  scaled_x x\nargument\n  x\nhas type\n  \u211d \u2192 \u211d : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u211d : Type\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to synthesize\n  HMul \u211d ((\u211d \u2192 \u211d) \u2192 (\u211d \u2192 \u211d) \u2192 \u211d) ?m.2460\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: 'slope' has already been declared\napplication type mismatch\n  slope ((fun a => k * a) '' A) B\nargument\n  B\nhas type\n  Set \u211d : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u211d : Type\nfailed to synthesize\n  AddTorsor ?m.83 Prop\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\napplication type mismatch\n  slope A B\nargument\n  B\nhas type\n  Set \u211d : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u211d : Type\nfailed to synthesize\n  AddTorsor ?m.3302 Prop\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nPlease revise the proof.",

This means that \\( F(x) \\) represents a function whose rate of change at any point \\( x \\) is exactly \\( f(x) \\).

In other words, there's no sudden jump or gap in the function at \\( c \\); the function behaves smoothly around that point.\n\nNow, the limit of \\( f(x) \\) as \\( x \\) approaches \\( c \\) represents the value that \\( f(x) \\) gets closer to as \\( x \\) gets nearer and nearer to \\( c \\). Since \\( f \\) is continuous at \\( c \\), by definition, as \\( x \\) approaches \\( c \\), \\( f(x) \\) must approach \\( f(c) \\).\n\nTherefore, putting these ideas together, the continuity of \\( f \\) at \\( c \\) ensures that the limit of \\( f(x) \\) as \\( x \\) approaches \\( c \\) is indeed equal to \\( f(c) \\).

These points occur where \\( f(x) = 0 \\). Solving the equation \\( 3x^3 - 4x + 2 = 0 \\) will give us the x-values where the curve crosses the x-axis. These points are crucial because they help us determine the sections of the curve that lie above or below the x-axis, which affects how we calculate the area.\n\n2. **Determine Regions Above and Below the x-axis:**\n   Once we have the intersection points, we examine the behavior of \\( f(x) \\) in each sub-interval defined by these points. If \\( f(x) \\) is positive in a sub-interval, the curve lies above the x-axis there, and the area contribution is simply the integral of \\( f(x) \\) over that interval. If \\( f(x) \\) is negative, the curve is below the x-axis, and the area contribution is the absolute value of the integral of \\( f(x) \\) over that interval. This distinction ensures that all area contributions are counted positively, regardless of whether the curve is above or below the x-axis.\n\n3. **Set Up the Integral(s):**\n   For each region where the function is consistently above or below the x-axis, we set up an integral to calculate the area. If there are multiple regions, we'll have multiple integrals corresponding to each section.\n\n4. **Compute the Integrals:**\n   Calculate the definite integrals over each sub-interval identified. This involves finding the antiderivative of \\( f(x) \\) and evaluating it at the boundaries of each sub-interval. The result of each integral gives the area of that particular region.\n\n5. **Sum the Areas:**\n   Finally, add up the areas from all the sub-intervals to obtain the total area bounded by the curve and the x-axis from \\( x = -1 \\) to \\( x = 2 \\).\n\nBy following these steps, we can accurately determine the total area enclosed between the curve \\( f(x) = 3x^3 - 4x + 2 \\) and the x-axis over the specified interval.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.measureSpace', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'integral', and it does not have executable code\ninvalid projection, structure has only 1 field(s)\n  1.\nhas type\n  Float\nfailed to synthesize\n  MeasureTheory.MeasureSpace \u2115\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  Neg (Set \u2115)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  NormedAddCommGroup \u2115\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  NormedSpace \u211d \u2115\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\ninvalid projection, structure has only 1 field(s)\n  1.\nhas type\n  Float\ntactic 'assumption' failed\ncase refine_1\nh : area = \u222b (x : \u211d) in -sorryAx (Set \u211d) true, 3 * x ^ 3 - 4 * x + 2\n\u22a2 NormedAddCommGroup \u2115\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: invalid projection, structure has only 1 field(s)\n  1.\nhas type\n  Float\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.measureSpace', and it does not have executable code\ninvalid projection, structure has only 1 field(s)\n  1.\nhas type\n  Float\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: invalid projection, structure has only 1 field(s)\n  1.\nhas type\n  Float\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.measureSpace', and it does not have executable code\ninvalid projection, structure has only 1 field(s)\n  1.\nhas type\n  Float\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

More precisely, there exists a linear map that best approximates the change in \\( f \\) as we make small movements from \\( (x_0, y_0) \\). This linear map can be thought of as consisting of two components: one that relates to changes in the \\( x \\)-direction and another for changes in the \\( y \\)-direction.\n\nThese two components of the linear map are precisely the partial derivatives of \\( f \\) with respect to \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) at \\( (x_0, y_0) \\). The existence of this linear approximation implies that as we move infinitesimally in the \\( x \\)-direction (keeping \\( y \\) fixed), the rate at which \\( f \\) changes is well-defined and linear. Similarly, moving infinitesimally in the \\( y \\)-direction while keeping \\( x \\) fixed also yields a well-defined linear rate of change.\n\nSince differentiability ensures that these linear rates of change exist and behave nicely, it follows directly that the partial derivatives \\( \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} \\) and \\( \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} \\) must exist at the point \\( (x_0, y_0) \\).

        "informal_proof": "# Informal Proof:\n\nTo understand why the coordinate vector of any vector \\( x \\) with respect to the basis \\( C \\), denoted \\( [x]_C \\), is equal to the change of basis matrix \\( P \\) multiplied by the coordinate vector of \\( x \\) with respect to the basis \\( B \\), denoted \\( [x]_B \\), let's break down the concepts involved.\n\nFirst, recall that a **basis** of a vector space \\( V \\) is a set of vectors that are both linearly independent and span the entire space. Given two bases \\( B = \\{v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_n\\} \\) and \\( C = \\{w_1, w_2, \\ldots, w_n\\} \\) for \\( V \\), any vector \\( x \\in V \\) can be uniquely expressed as a linear combination of the vectors in \\( B \\) or in \\( C \\). The coefficients of these linear combinations form the coordinate vectors \\( [x]_B \\) and \\( [x]_C \\) respectively.\n\nThe **change of basis matrix** \\( P \\) from \\( B \\) to \\( C \\) is constructed by expressing each vector in the basis \\( C \\) as a linear combination of the vectors in \\( B \\). Specifically, for each \\( w_j \\) in \\( C \\), we find scalars \\( a_{1j}, a_{2j}, \\ldots, a_{nj} \\) such that:\n\\[\nw_j = a_{1j}v_1 + a_{2j}v_2 + \\ldots + a_{nj}v_n\n\\]\nThese scalars become the entries of the matrix \\( P \\), where the \\( j \\)-th column of \\( P \\) consists of the coefficients \\( a_{1j}, a_{2j}, \\ldots, a_{nj} \\).\n\nNow, consider a vector \\( x \\in V \\). When expressed in the basis \\( B \\), it looks like:\n\\[\nx = b_1 v_1 + b_2 v_2 + \\ldots + b_n v_n\n\\]\nwhere \\( [x]_B = \\begin{bmatrix} b_1 \\\\ b_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ b_n \\end{bmatrix} \\).\n\nTo find \\( [x]_C \\), we want to express \\( x \\) in terms of the basis \\( C \\):\n\\[\nx = c_1 w_1 + c_2 w_2 + \\ldots + c_n w_n\n\\]\nOur goal is to find the relationship between \\( [x]_B \\) and \\( [x]_C \\).\n\nSubstituting each \\( w_j \\) with its expression in terms of \\( B \\):\n\\[\nx = c_1 (a_{11}v_1 + a_{21}v_2 + \\ldots + a_{n1}v_n) + c_2 (a_{12}v_1 + a_{22}v_2 + \\ldots + a_{n2}v_n) + \\ldots + c_n (a_{1n}v_1 + a_{2n}v_2 + \\ldots + a_{nn}v_n)\n\\]\nWhen you distribute the scalars and collect like terms, the coefficients of each \\( v_i \\) in this expression must match the coefficients from the original expression of \\( x \\) in basis \\( B \\). This results in a system of equations that can be represented in matrix form as:\n\\[\nP \\begin{bmatrix} c_1 \\\\ c_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ c_n \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} b_1 \\\\ b_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ b_n \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nHere, \\( P \\) is the change of basis matrix from \\( C \\) to \\( B \\), and the equation shows how the coordinates in basis \\( C \\) relate to those in basis \\( B \\).\n\nHowever, since \\( P \\) was defined as the change of basis matrix from \\( B \\) to \\( C \\), to express \\( [x]_C \\) in terms of \\( [x]_B \\), we consider the inverse relationship. Essentially, multiplying \\( P \\) by \\( [x]_B \\) transforms the coordinates from basis \\( B \\) to basis \\( C \\). Therefore, for any vector \\( x \\in V \\):\n\\[\n[x]_C = P [x]_B\n\\]\nThis equation succinctly captures how the change of basis matrix \\( P \\) facilitates the transformation of coordinate vectors between the two bases \\( B \\) and \\( C \\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: expected token\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unexpected token '['; expected ':=', '_', 'rec' or identifier\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: expected token\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

This means that every vector \\( v \\) in \\( V \\) can be uniquely expressed as a linear combination of the vectors in \\( B_1 \\) and also as a linear combination of the vectors in \\( B_2 \\).\n\n**Coordinate Vectors:**\nFor any vector \\( v \\) in \\( V \\), the coordinate vector \\([v]_{B_1}\\) represents the coefficients of \\( v \\) when expressed in terms of the basis \\( B_1 \\). Similarly, \\([v]_{B_2}\\) represents the coefficients when \\( v \\) is expressed in terms of \\( B_2 \\).\n\n**Constructing the Matrix \\( A \\):**\nOur goal is to find a matrix \\( A \\) such that \\([v]_{B_1} = A \\cdot [v]_{B_2}\\) for all \\( v \\) in \\( V \\). To construct \\( A \\), consider how each vector in \\( B_1 \\) can be expressed in terms of \\( B_2 \\).\n\n1. **Expressing \\( B_1 \\) in Terms of \\( B_2 \\):**\n   Since \\( B_1 \\) is a basis, each \\( v_i \\) in \\( B_1 \\) can be written uniquely as a linear combination of the vectors in \\( B_2 \\):\n   \\[\n   v_i = a_{1i}w_1 + a_{2i}w_2 + \\ldots + a_{ni}w_n\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( a_{ji} \\) are the scalars from the field \\( F \\).\n\n2. **Forming the Matrix \\( A \\):**\n   The coefficients \\( a_{ji} \\) from these expressions become the entries of the matrix \\( A \\). Specifically, the \\( i \\)-th column of \\( A \\) consists of the coefficients \\( a_{1i}, a_{2i}, \\ldots, a_{ni} \\). So, \\( A \\) looks like this:\n   \\[\n   A = \\begin{bmatrix}\n   a_{11} & a_{12} & \\cdots & a_{1n} \\\\\n   a_{21} & a_{22} & \\cdots & a_{2n} \\\\\n   \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n   a_{n1} & a_{n2} & \\cdots & a_{nn}\n   \\end{bmatrix}\n   \\]\n   \n**Verifying the Relationship:**\nWith this matrix \\( A \\) constructed, let's see why it satisfies \\([v]_{B_1} = A \\cdot [v]_{B_2}\\):\n\n- Take any vector \\( v \\) in \\( V \\). Expressing \\( v \\) in terms of \\( B_2 \\) gives \\([v]_{B_2}\\).\n- Multiplying \\( A \\) by \\([v]_{B_2}\\) effectively combines the columns of \\( A \\) (which represent how \\( B_1 \\) is built from \\( B_2 \\)) using the coefficients from \\([v]_{B_2}\\).\n- This combination yields the coordinates of \\( v \\) with respect to \\( B_1 \\), which is precisely \\([v]_{B_1}\\).\n\n**Uniqueness of \\( A \\):**\nSuppose there were another matrix \\( A' \\) that also satisfied \\([v]_{B_1} = A' \\cdot [v]_{B_2}\\) for all \\( v \\) in \\( V \\).

The diagonal\u202fAC connects corner\u202fA to corner\u202fC.\n\nNow, we're instructed to transform this diagonal\u202fAC into a new line segment\u202fAE such that the length of\u202fAE equals the sum of the lengths of\u202fAB and\u202fBC, which means\u202fAE =\u202f*a* +\u202f*b*. Essentially, we're extending the diagonal AC to a new point\u202fE so that the entire length from\u202fA to\u202fE is\u202f*a* +\u202f*b*.\n\nNext, consider triangle\u202fABE, formed by the points\u202fA,\u202fB, and the new point\u202fE. Our goal is to determine the area of this triangle and show that it is exactly half the area of the original rectangle\u202fABCD.\n\nThe area of rectangle\u202fABCD is straightforward to calculate: it's just the product of its side lengths, so Area =\u202f*a*\u202f\u00d7\u202f*b*.\n\nTo find the area of triangle\u202fABE, notice that it shares the base\u202fAB with the rectangle. The height of triangle\u202fABE, relative to this base, extends from point\u202fB up to point\u202fE. Since\u202fAE =\u202f*a* +\u202f*b*, and considering the rectangle's dimensions, this height effectively reaches the combined length of the rectangle's sides.\n\nHowever, to relate this to the rectangle's area, observe that when you extend the diagonal\u202fAC to\u202fAE =\u202f*a* +\u202f*b*, you are essentially creating a larger triangle\u202fABE that encompasses exactly half of the area of the rectangle. This is because the diagonal of a rectangle divides it into two equal-area triangles, and by extending it proportionally to\u202f*a* +\u202f*b*, you're scaling the area in such a way that triangle\u202fABE still maintains this half-area relationship.\n\nTherefore, the area of triangle\u202fABE is half of the area of rectangle\u202fABCD. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n\nArea of Triangle\u202fABE = (1/2) \u00d7\u202f*a* \u00d7\u202f*b*\n\nThis shows that triangle\u202fABE occupies exactly half the area of the original rectangle.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'ABCD'\nunknown identifier 'ABE'\nunsolved goals\na b : \u211d\n\u22a2 2\u207b\u00b9 * a * b = 2\u207b\u00b9 * (a * b)\nPlease revise the proof.",

Given that \\( A \\) is a \\( 2 \\times 2 \\) matrix with a non-zero determinant (\\( \\det(A) \\neq 0 \\)), this implies that \\( A \\) is invertible. \n\nHere's why:\n\n1. **Non-zero Determinant Implies Invertibility:** In linear algebra, a square matrix has an inverse if and only if its determinant is not zero. The determinant essentially measures how the matrix scales areas (in 2D) or volumes (in higher dimensions). A non-zero determinant means that the transformation \\( A \\) does not collapse the plane into a line or a point; it preserves the two-dimensional nature of the space in some scaled and possibly rotated form.\n\n2. **Existence of Inverse Matrix \\( B \\):** Since \\( A \\) is invertible, there exists another matrix \\( B \\) such that when you multiply \\( A \\) by \\( B \\), you get the identity matrix. Symbolically, \\( B \\times A = I \\), where \\( I \\) is the identity matrix. This matrix \\( B \\) serves as the inverse of \\( A \\).\n\n3. **Reversing the Transformation:** Given that \\( A \\) transforms a vector \\( v \\) to another vector \\( w \\) (i.e., \\( w = A v \\)), applying the inverse matrix \\( B \\) to \\( w \\) will reverse this transformation. Mathematically, this is represented as \\( v = B w \\). Essentially, \\( B \\) \"undoes\" what \\( A \\) did, bringing \\( w \\) back to the original vector \\( v \\).\n\n4. **Applicability in Polar Coordinates:** The fact that vectors are expressed in polar coordinates doesn't change the fundamental property of \\( A \\) being invertible. Polar coordinates are just another way of representing vectors, and linear transformations like those represented by \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) operate consistently regardless of the coordinate system used.\n\nIn summary, because the determinant of \\( A \\) is non-zero, \\( A \\) is invertible.

        "informal_proof": "# Informal Proof:\nTo determine whether the new teaching method has a significant positive effect on students' test scores, we start by examining the given information. The average score for the standardized test is 80, with a standard deviation of 10. The teacher's class of 30 students achieved an average score of 85 after implementing the new teaching method.\n\nOur goal is to test the null hypothesis, which states that the new teaching method has no effect, meaning the true average score would still be 80. The alternative hypothesis suggests that the new method does have a positive effect, increasing the average score above 80. We set our significance level at 0.05, which means we're willing to accept a 5% chance of incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis when it's actually true.\n\nTo assess whether the observed increase to an average score of 85 is significant, we calculate how much this sample mean deviates from the expected mean of 80 under the null hypothesis. We use the standard error of the mean, which accounts for the variability in scores and the size of our sample. Specifically, the standard error is the standard deviation divided by the square root of the number of students, which in this case is 10 divided by the square root of 30, approximately 1.826.\n\nNext, we determine how many standard errors the observed mean of 85 is away from the null hypothesis mean of 80. By subtracting 80 from 85, we get a difference of 5 points. Dividing this by the standard error (5 divided by 1.826) gives us a z-score of approximately 2.737. \n\nWe then compare this z-score to the critical value for a one-tailed test at the 0.05 significance level, which is about 1.645. Since 2.737 is greater than 1.645, the result is statistically significant.\n\nTherefore, we have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis. This means that there is strong evidence to support the claim that the new teaching method has a positive effect on the students' test scores.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  OfNat Prop 80\nnumerals are polymorphic in Lean, but the numeral `80` cannot be used in a context where the expected type is\n  Prop\ndue to the absence of the instance above\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  OfNat Prop 85\nnumerals are polymorphic in Lean, but the numeral `85` cannot be used in a context where the expected type is\n  Prop\ndue to the absence of the instance above\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: type expected, got\n  (\"Reject the null hypothesis: The new teaching method has a positive effect.\" : String)\nsimp made no progress\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown namespace 'Real'\nunknown constant 'OfNat'\nunknown constant 'sorryAx'\nunknown constant 'sorryAx'\nunknown constant 'OfNat'\nunknown constant 'sorryAx'\nunknown constant 'sorryAx'\nunknown constant 'OfNat'\nunknown constant 'sorryAx'\nunknown constant 'sorryAx'\nunknown constant 'OfNat'\nunknown constant 'sorryAx'\nunknown constant 'sorryAx'\nunknown constant 'OfScientific'\nunknown constant 'sorryAx'\nunknown constant 'sorryAx'\nunknown identifier 'populationMean'\nunknown constant 'sorryAx'\nunknown constant 'sorryAx'\nunknown identifier 'populationMean'\nunknown constant 'sorryAx'\nunknown constant 'sorryAx'\nunexpected token '+'; expected command\nunknown identifier 'sampleStdDev'\nunknown constant 'sorryAx'\nunknown constant 'sorryAx'\nexpected token\nunexpected token '-'; expected ')', ',' or ':'\nunknown constant 'OfScientific'\nunknown constant 'sorryAx'\nunknown constant 'sorryAx'\nexpected token\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nunexpected token 'if'; expected term\nPlease revise the proof.",

The derivative of \\( 2x \\) with respect to \\( x \\) is \\( 2 \\).\n\nPutting it all together, the derivative of \\( f(x) = e^{2x} \\) is:\n\\[\nf'(x) = e^{2x} \\times 2 = 2e^{2x}\n\\]\nSo, \\( \\frac{df}{dx} = 2f \\).\n\nNext, we address the differential equation \\( \\frac{df}{dx} = 2f \\). This equation states that the rate of change of \\( f \\) with respect to \\( x \\) is twice the value of \\( f \\) itself. \n\nTo solve this, we recognize that the equation is a first-order linear differential equation. The solution to such an equation typically involves exponential functions. Specifically, if \\( \\frac{df}{dx} = kf \\), where \\( k \\) is a constant, the solution is \\( f(x) = Ce^{kx} \\), where \\( C \\) is a constant of integration.\n\nApplying this to our equation \\( \\frac{df}{dx} = 2f \\), we set \\( k = 2 \\), which leads to the solution:\n\\[\nf(x) = Ce^{2x}\n\\]\nHere, \\( C \\) represents an arbitrary constant that can be determined if an initial condition is provided.\n\nIn summary, by using the chain rule, we found that the derivative of \\( f(x) = e^{2x} \\) is \\( 2e^{2x} \\), and by solving the differential equation \\( \\frac{df}{dx} = 2f \\), we confirmed that the general solution is an exponential function of the form \\( f(x) = Ce^{2x} \\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.exp', and it does not have executable code\ncompiler IR check failed at 'f'', error: unknown declaration 'Real.exp'\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nunexpected token ','; expected '\u21a6', '=>'\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.exp', and it does not have executable code\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.exp', and it does not have executable code\ncompiler IR check failed at 'f'', error: unknown declaration 'Real.exp'\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

Specifically, we're interested in when angle \\( BPC \\) itself is obtuse. According to geometric principles, angle \\( BPC \\) will be greater than 90 degrees if and only if point \\( P \\) lies inside the circle that has segment \\( BC \\) as its diameter. This is a direct application of Thales' theorem, which states that any angle inscribed in a semicircle is a right angle. Therefore, points inside this circle will form an angle \\( BPC \\) that is larger than 90 degrees, making the triangle obtuse.\n\n2. **Determining the Area Where \\( BPC \\) Is Obtuse:**\n   - **Square \\( ABCD \\) Dimensions:** Each side of the square is 2 units long, so the total area of the square is \\( 2 \\times 2 = 4 \\) square units.\n   - **Circle with Diameter \\( BC \\):** The length of \\( BC \\) is 2 units, so the radius of the circle with \\( BC \\) as its diameter is \\( 1 \\) unit. The area of a full circle with radius 1 is \\( \\pi \\times 1^2 = \\pi \\) square units. However, since the circle extends beyond the square and only the portion of the circle within the square is relevant, we observe that only half of this circle lies inside the square. Therefore, the area within the square where \\( P \\) makes angle \\( BPC \\) obtuse is \\( \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\) square units.\n\n3. **Calculating the Probability:**\n   The probability that a randomly chosen point \\( P \\) inside the square makes triangle \\( BPC \\) obtuse is the ratio of the area where \\( BPC \\) is obtuse to the total area of the square. Thus, the probability is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Probability} = \\frac{\\text{Area where } BPC \\text{ is obtuse}}{\\text{Total area of the square}} = \\frac{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}{4} = \\frac{\\pi}{8}\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Conclusion:**\n   Therefore, the probability that a randomly chosen point \\( P \\) inside square \\( ABCD \\) results in triangle \\( BPC \\) being obtuse is \\( \\frac{\\pi}{8} \\), which is approximately 0.3927 or 39.27%.\nPrevious attempt failed with: ambiguous, possible interpretations \n  \u03c0 : \u2115 \u2192 \u2115\n  \n  \u03c0 : \u211d\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'obtuse_probability', and it does not have executable code\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown namespace 'MeasureTheory'\nunknown namespace 'Real'\nexpected token\nexpected line break or token\nunknown identifier 'obtuse_probability'\nunknown constant 'sorryAx'\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown namespace 'MeasureTheory'\nunknown namespace 'Real'\nexpected token\nexpected line break or token\nunknown identifier 'obtuse_probability'\nunknown constant 'sorryAx'\nPlease revise the proof.",

An even integer is any number that can be divided by 2 without leaving a remainder. In other words, if \"a\" is even, we can think of it as two times some integer. On the other hand, an odd integer leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 2. So if \"b\" is odd, it's like having two times some integer plus one.\n\nNow, let's look at the sum of \"a\" and \"b\". Since \"a\" is even, we can represent it as 2 multiplied by an integer (let's call it k). That gives us 2k. For \"b\", being odd means it can be represented as 2 times another integer (let's say m) plus one, which is 2m + 1.\n\nWhen we add \"a\" and \"b\" together:\n\\[ a + b = 2k + (2m + 1) \\]\n\nCombining the terms, we get:\n\\[ a + b = 2k + 2m + 1 \\]\n\\[ a + b = 2(k + m) + 1 \\]\n\nHere, \\(2(k + m)\\) is clearly an even number because it's two times some integer. Adding one to an even number always results in an odd number. Therefore, the sum of \"a\" (even) and \"b\" (odd) is odd.\n\nThis shows that whenever you add an even integer to an odd integer, the result will always be an odd integer.\nPrevious attempt failed with: invalid field notation, type is not of the form (C ...) where C is a constant\n  Even\nhas type\n  ?m.1096 \u2192 Prop\ninvalid field notation, type is not of the form (C ...) where C is a constant\n  Odd\nhas type\n  ?m.1635 \u2192 Prop\ninvalid field notation, type is not of the form (C ...) where C is a constant\n  Odd\nhas type\n  ?m.2484 \u2192 Prop\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: 'Even' has already been declared\n'Odd' has already been declared\nunsolved goals\ncase h\na b k : \u2124\nhk : a = k + k\nm : \u2124\nhm : b = 2 * m + 1\n\u22a2 1 + k * 2 + m * 2 = 3 + k * 2 + m * 2\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unsolved goals\ncase h\na b k : \u2124\nhk : a = k + k\nm : \u2124\nhm : b = 2 * m + 1\n\u22a2 1 + k * 2 + m * 2 = 3 + k * 2 + m * 2\nPlease revise the proof.",

Spherical coordinates are particularly well-suited for this problem because they align naturally with the symmetry of a sphere.\n\nFirst, let's understand the components involved. In spherical coordinates, any point in space is described by three parameters:\n- \\( r \\): the distance from the origin to the point.\n- \\( \\theta \\): the angle measured from the positive \\( x \\)-axis in the \\( xy \\)-plane.\n- \\( \\phi \\): the angle measured from the positive \\( z \\)-axis down to the point.\n\nThe volume element in spherical coordinates, denoted as \\( dV \\), represents an infinitesimally small \"chunk\" of volume at a given point. For spherical coordinates, this volume element is expressed as:\n\\[ dV = r^2 \\sin(\\phi) \\, dr \\, d\\phi \\, d\\theta \\]\nHere's why each part is included:\n- \\( r^2 \\) accounts for the expansion of the volume as we move outward from the origin.\n- \\( \\sin(\\phi) \\) adjusts for the fact that circles of constant \\( r \\) shrink as \\( \\phi \\) approaches \\( 0 \\) or \\( \\pi \\), ensuring accurate coverage of the spherical surface.\n\nTo find the total volume of the sphere, we integrate this volume element over the entire region that the sphere occupies. This involves setting the appropriate limits for each variable:\n- \\( r \\) ranges from \\( 0 \\) to the sphere's radius \\( R \\), covering all distances from the center to the surface.\n- \\( \\phi \\) ranges from \\( 0 \\) to \\( \\pi \\), spanning the angles from the top to the bottom of the sphere.\n- \\( \\theta \\) ranges from \\( 0 \\) to \\( 2\\pi \\), completing a full rotation around the \\( z \\)-axis.\n\nPutting it all together, the triple integral becomes:\n\\[ \\text{Volume} = \\int_{0}^{R} \\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} r^2 \\sin(\\phi) \\, d\\theta \\, d\\phi \\, dr \\]\n\nWhen we evaluate this integral, each part accounts for a different dimension of the sphere:\n1. The \\( d\\theta \\) integration sweeps around the entire azimuthal angle, covering the full circle.\n2. The \\( d\\phi \\) integration moves from the top to the bottom of the sphere, capturing the polar angle variations.\n3. The \\( dr \\) integration accumulates all the infinitesimal spherical shells from the center out to radius \\( R \\).\n\nBy performing these integrations step by step, we effectively sum up all the infinitesimal volume elements that make up the entire sphere. This process confirms that the volume of the sphere is indeed given by the triple integral of \\( dV = r^2 \\sin(\\phi) \\, dr \\, d\\phi \\, d\\theta \\) over the appropriate limits, thereby proving that the volume can be calculated using this integral in spherical coordinates.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unexpected token '\u03c6'; expected '_' or identifier\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unexpected token '\u03c6'; expected '_' or identifier\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unexpected token '\u03c6'; expected '_' or identifier\nPlease revise the proof.",

Therefore, the probability that the second card you draw is also an ace is 3 out of 51, simplifying to 1 out of 17.\n\nTo find the overall probability that both events happen (drawing an ace first and then another ace), you multiply the two individual probabilities together.

The height of the triangle extends from the x-axis up to the point \\( (3, 6) \\), giving it a height of 6 units.\n\nThe formula for the area of a triangle is:\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}\n\\]\nPlugging in the values we have:\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 3 \\times 6 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 18 = 9\n\\]\nTherefore, the integral of \\( f(x) = 2x \\) from 0 to 3 equals 9.\n\nAlternatively, using the concept of antiderivatives, we know that the antiderivative of \\( 2x \\) is \\( x^2 \\).

So, the new length is:\n\\[ 8 + (-5) = 3 \\text{ units} \\]\n\nNext, we adjust the width by increasing it by 2 units:\n\\[ -3 + 2 = -1 \\text{ unit} \\]\n\nNow, to find the perimeter of the new rectangle, we use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, which is:\n\\[ \\text{Perimeter} = 2 \\times (\\text{Length} + \\text{Width}) \\]\n\nSubstituting the new length and width into the formula:\n\\[ \\text{Perimeter} = 2 \\times (3 + (-1)) \\]\n\\[ \\text{Perimeter} = 2 \\times 2 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Perimeter} = 4 \\text{ units} \\]\n\nTherefore, the perimeter of the new rectangle is 4 units.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'calc'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'calc'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

If A is a multiple of B, this means that A can be expressed as B multiplied by some real number. In other words, there exists a real number k such that A = k\u202f\u00d7\u202fB.\n\nNow, if we increase A by a factor of x, we're essentially multiplying A by x. So, the new value becomes x\u202f\u00d7\u202fA.

This means that for every 3 boys, there are 2 girls. To simplify, we can think of the entire class as being divided into 3 parts boys and 2 parts girls, making a total of 3 + 2 = 5 equal parts.\n\nNext, since the total number of students in the classroom is represented by the variable \"x,\" each of these 5 parts corresponds to a fraction of the total number of students. Specifically, each part is equal to x divided by 5, or x/5.\n\nNow, to find the number of boys:\n- There are 3 parts of boys.\n- Each part is x/5 students.\n- So, the number of boys is 3 multiplied by x/5, which is (3x)/5.\n\nSimilarly, to find the number of girls:\n- There are 2 parts of girls.\n- Each part is x/5 students.\n- Therefore, the number of girls is 2 multiplied by x/5, which is (2x)/5.\n\nIn summary:\n- Number of boys = (3x)/5\n- Number of girls = (2x)/5\n\nThis ensures that the ratio of boys to girls remains 3:2 while accounting for the total number of students in the classroom.\nPrevious attempt failed with: omega could not prove the goal:\na possible counterexample may satisfy the constraints\n  0 \u2264 2*a - 5*c \u2264 4\n  0 \u2264 3*a - 5*b \u2264 4\n  a - b - c \u2265 1\n  a \u2265 0\nwhere\n a := \u2191x\n b := \u2191(3 * x) / 5\n c := \u2191(2 * x) / 5\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unsolved goals\nx : \u2115\nboys : \u2115 := 3 * x / 5\ngirls : \u2115 := 2 * x / 5\n\u22a2 x * 3 / 5 * 2 = x * 2 / 5 * 3\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'rewrite' failed, equality or iff proof expected\n  \u2115\ncase left\nx : \u2115\nboys : \u2115 := 3 * x / 5\ngirls : \u2115 := 2 * x / 5\n\u22a2 boys * 5 = 3 * x\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, equality or iff proof expected\n  \u2115\ncase right\nx : \u2115\nboys : \u2115 := 3 * x / 5\ngirls : \u2115 := 2 * x / 5\n\u22a2 girls * 5 = 2 * x\nPlease revise the proof.",

For example, if \\( \\mathbf{a} = (a_1, a_2) \\) and \\( \\mathbf{b} = (b_1, b_2) \\), then \\( \\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{b} = (a_1 + b_1, a_2 + b_2) \\).\n   - **Scalar Multiplication (\\( c\\mathbf{a} \\))**: This scales a vector by multiplying each of its components by the scalar \\( c \\). Using the same vectors as above, \\( c\\mathbf{a} = (c \\cdot a_1, c \\cdot a_2) \\).\n\n2. **Applying Scalar Multiplication to the Sum of Vectors:**\n   - When we compute \\( c(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{b}) \\), we're scaling the resultant vector from the addition of \\( \\mathbf{a} \\) and \\( \\mathbf{b} \\). Using our earlier example:\n     \\[\n     c(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{b}) = c(a_1 + b_1, a_2 + b_2) = (c(a_1 + b_1), c(a_2 + b_2))\n     \\]\n   \n3. **Distributing the Scalar Across the Vector Components:**\n   - Distribute the scalar \\( c \\) to each component within the parentheses:\n     \\[\n     (c(a_1 + b_1), c(a_2 + b_2)) = (c \\cdot a_1 + c \\cdot b_1, c \\cdot a_2 + c \\cdot b_2)\n     \\]\n   \n4. **Separating the Scaled Vectors:**\n   - Notice that the above expression can be seen as adding the individually scaled vectors:\n     \\[\n     (c \\cdot a_1 + c \\cdot b_1, c \\cdot a_2 + c \\cdot b_2) = (c \\cdot a_1, c \\cdot a_2) + (c \\cdot b_1, c \\cdot b_2) = c\\mathbf{a} + c\\mathbf{b}\n     \\]\n   \n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Through these steps, we've shown that scaling the sum of two vectors \\( \\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{b} \\) by \\( c \\) is equivalent to scaling each vector individually by \\( c \\) and then adding the results. Therefore, the equality \\( c(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{b}) = c\\mathbf{a} + c\\mathbf{b} \\) holds true in any real vector space.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  HSMul \u211d (\u211d ^ 2) ?m.587\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  HPow Type \u2115 Type\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  HPow Type \u2115 Type\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

By Fubini's Theorem, which allows us to switch the order of integration for suitable functions, we can rewrite the double integral as:\n   \\[\n   L[F(t)] = \\int_0^\\infty \\left( \\int_\\tau^\\infty e^{-st} \\, dt \\right) f(\\tau) \\, d\\tau\n   \\]\n   Here, we've changed the order so that for each fixed \\( \\tau \\), we integrate \\( t \\) from \\( \\tau \\) to \\( \\infty \\).\n\n3. **Evaluate the Inner Integral:**\n   \n   Focus on the inner integral:\n   \\[\n   \\int_\\tau^\\infty e^{-st} \\, dt\n   \\]\n   To solve this, perform a substitution where \\( u = st \\). This simplifies the integral to:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{s} \\int_{s\\tau}^\\infty e^{-u} \\, du = \\frac{e^{-s\\tau}}{s}\n   \\]\n   So, the inner integral evaluates to \\( \\frac{e^{-s\\tau}}{s} \\).\n\n4. **Substitute Back and Simplify:**\n   \n   Plugging this result back into our expression for \\( L[F(t)] \\), we get:\n   \\[\n   L[F(t)] = \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{e^{-s\\tau}}{s} f(\\tau) \\, d\\tau = \\frac{1}{s} \\int_0^\\infty e^{-s\\tau} f(\\tau) \\, d\\tau\n   \\]\n   Recognizing that \\( \\int_0^\\infty e^{-s\\tau} f(\\tau) \\, d\\tau \\) is the Laplace transform of \\( f(t) \\), denoted \\( L[f(t)] \\), we can write:\n   \\[\n   L[F(t)] = \\frac{1}{s} L[f(t)]\n   \\]\n   \n5. **Conclusion:**\n   \n   This shows that the Laplace transform of the integral of \\( f(t) \\) from \\( 0 \\) to \\( t \\) is indeed equal to the Laplace transform of \\( f(t) \\) divided by \\( s \\), as required:\n   \\[\n   L[F(t)] = \\frac{1}{s} L[f(t)]\n   \\]\n\nThis informal reasoning relies on the properties of integration and the definition of the Laplace transform, effectively demonstrating the desired relationship.\nPrevious attempt failed with: invalid field notation, type is not of the form (C ...) where C is a constant\n  set\nhas type\n  ?m.126 \u2192 ?m.127 PUnit.{?u.125 + 1}\ninvalid field notation, type is not of the form (C ...) where C is a constant\n  set\nhas type\n  ?m.424 \u2192 ?m.425 PUnit.{?u.423 + 1}\ninvalid field notation, type is not of the form (C ...) where C is a constant\n  set\nhas type\n  ?m.923 \u2192 ?m.924 PUnit.{?u.922 + 1}\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: invalid field notation, type is not of the form (C ...) where C is a constant\n  set\nhas type\n  ?m.126 \u2192 ?m.127 PUnit.{?u.125 + 1}\ninvalid field notation, type is not of the form (C ...) where C is a constant\n  set\nhas type\n  ?m.424 \u2192 ?m.425 PUnit.{?u.423 + 1}\ninvalid field notation, type is not of the form (C ...) where C is a constant\n  set\nhas type\n  ?m.923 \u2192 ?m.924 PUnit.{?u.922 + 1}\nunknown identifier 'begin'\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: invalid field notation, type is not of the form (C ...) where C is a constant\n  set\nhas type\n  ?m.126 \u2192 ?m.127 PUnit.{?u.125 + 1}\ninvalid field notation, type is not of the form (C ...) where C is a constant\n  set\nhas type\n  ?m.424 \u2192 ?m.425 PUnit.{?u.423 + 1}\ninvalid field notation, type is not of the form (C ...) where C is a constant\n  set\nhas type\n  ?m.923 \u2192 ?m.924 PUnit.{?u.922 + 1}\nunknown identifier 'begin'\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

The differences between the observed values \\( y_i \\) and the predicted values \\( \\hat{y}_i \\) are called residuals, given by \\( y_i - \\hat{y}_i \\).\n\nTo determine the best-fitting line, the method of least squares is used. This method seeks to minimize the sum of the squared residuals across all observations. When we adjust \\( \\beta_0 \\) and \\( \\beta_1 \\) to achieve this minimization, certain mathematical conditions, known as the normal equations, must be satisfied.\n\nOne of these normal equations ensures that the sum of the residuals themselves (not squared) equals zero. Intuitively, this happens because the least squares method balances the residuals above and below the regression line. If the sum of the residuals were not zero, it would indicate that the line could be adjusted slightly upward or downward to better balance the residuals, thereby reducing the overall sum of squared residuals. However, since we've already minimized the squared residuals, the only way this balance can be perfect is if the positive and negative residuals cancel each other out, resulting in their sum being zero.\n\nTherefore, by the very process of fitting the regression line using least squares, we ensure that the positive deviations above the line and the negative deviations below the line balance perfectly, making the total sum of the residuals equal to zero.\nPrevious attempt failed with: type expected, got\n  (\u03b5 : \u211d)\nexpected token\n'residual' has already been declared\napplication type mismatch\n  List.zipWith residual\nargument\n  residual\nhas type\n  (X : Type ?u.979) \u2192 [inst : TopologicalSpace X] \u2192 Filter X : Type (?u.979 + 1)\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u211d \u2192 \u211d \u2192 \u211d : Type\nunknown constant 'List.zipWith_eq_nil'\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, equality or iff proof expected\n  ?m.2357\n\u03b20 \u03b21 x y \u03b5 : \u211d\nxs ys : List \u211d\nh : xs.length = ys.length\n\u22a2 sorryAx (List \u211d \u2192 List \u211d \u2192 \u211d) true xs ys = 0\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: 'residual' has already been declared\napplication type mismatch\n  @residual \u03b20\nargument\n  \u03b20\nhas type\n  \u211d : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  Type ?u.770 : Type (?u.770 + 1)\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: 'residual' has already been declared\napplication type mismatch\n  @residual \u03b20\nargument\n  \u03b20\nhas type\n  \u211d : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  Type ?u.657 : Type (?u.657 + 1)\nPlease revise the proof.",

So, for the corn area:\n\\[ \\text{Corn Area} = 35 \\, \\text{units} \\times 25 \\, \\text{units} = 875 \\, \\text{square units} \\]\n\nNext, we look at the area allocated for wheat.

Using the same method:\n\\[ \\text{Wheat Area} = 30 \\, \\text{units} \\times 20 \\, \\text{units} = 600 \\, \\text{square units} \\]\n\nFinally, to find the total area of the field that Farmer Bob is using, we simply add the area used for corn to the area used for wheat:\n\\[ \\text{Total Area} = \\text{Corn Area} + \\text{Wheat Area} = 875 \\, \\text{square units} + 600 \\, \\text{square units} = 1{,}475 \\, \\text{square units} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total area of the rectangular field used by Farmer Bob is 1,475 square units.",

Applying this to the enlarged square, each side now measures `3x * 0.5`, which simplifies to `1.5x` inches.\n\nAccording to the problem, after both transformations, the final side length of the square is 6 inches.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how this test works and why it's appropriate for this situation.\n\n**1. Define the Hypotheses:**\n   - **Null Hypothesis (H\u2080):** There is no difference in the mean scores of the two groups. Mathematically, this is expressed as \u03bc\u2081 = \u03bc\u2082.\n   - **Alternative Hypothesis (H\u2081):** There is a significant difference in the mean scores of the two groups, meaning \u03bc\u2081 \u2260 \u03bc\u2082.\n\n**2. Gather the Sample Data:**\n   - **Group 1:** 14 students, mean score = 72, standard deviation = 4.\n   - **Group 2:** 12 students, mean score = 68, standard deviation = 5.\n\n**3. Calculate the Difference in Sample Means:**\n   - The first group has a higher average score by 4 points (72 - 68 = 4). We need to assess if this difference is large enough to be considered statistically significant or if it could have occurred by random chance.\n\n**4. Compute the Standard Error of the Difference:**\n   - The standard error measures how much the sample means are expected to fluctuate due to sampling variability.\n   - It is calculated using the standard deviations and sample sizes of both groups:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Standard Error} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{4^2}{14}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{5^2}{12}\\right)} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{16}{14}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{25}{12}\\right)} \\approx \\sqrt{1.14 + 2.08} \\approx \\sqrt{3.22} \\approx 1.80\n     \\]\n   \n**5. Determine the t-Statistic:**\n   - The t-statistic quantifies how many standard errors the observed difference in means is away from zero (the difference stated in the null hypothesis).\n   - Calculated as:\n     \\[\n     t = \\frac{\\text{Difference in Means}}{\\text{Standard Error}} = \\frac{4}{1.80} \\approx 2.22\n     \\]\n   \n**6. Establish Degrees of Freedom:**\n   - Degrees of freedom (df) are needed to reference the appropriate t-distribution table. For two samples, it's typically approximated using a formula that accounts for both sample sizes and variances. However, for simplicity, we'll use the smaller of (n\u2081 - 1) and (n\u2082 - 1), which is 11 in this case.\n\n**7. Determine the Critical t-Value:**\n   - At a significance level of 0.05 for a two-tailed test and 11 degrees of freedom, the critical t-value is approximately \u00b12.201 (this value can be found in t-distribution tables).\n\n**8. Compare the Calculated t-Statistic to the Critical t-Value:**\n   - Our calculated t-statistic is approximately 2.22, which is slightly greater than the critical value of 2.201.\n   \n**9. Make a Decision:**\n   - Since 2.22 > 2.201, we reject the null hypothesis. This suggests that there is a statistically significant difference between the mean scores of the two groups at the 0.05 significance level.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the two-sample t-test, there is sufficient evidence to conclude that the performance of the two groups of students on the trigonometric problem differs significantly. Specifically, the first group, with a higher mean score of 72, performs better than the second group, which has a mean score of 68.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 't_test', and it does not have executable code\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  t_stat\n\u03bc\u2081 \u03bc\u2082 \u03c3\u2081 \u03c3\u2082 : \u211d\nn\u2081 n\u2082 : \u2115\nt_stat : \u211d := t_test group1_mean group2_mean group1_stddev group2_stddev group1_size group2_size\nh : t_stat = calculated_t_statistic\n\u22a2 calculated_t_statistic > critical_t_value\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 't_stat', and it does not have executable code\ntype mismatch\n  critical_t_value\nhas type\n  \u211d : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u211d \u2192 \u211d \u2192 \u211d \u2192 \u211d \u2192 \u2115 \u2192 \u2115 \u2192 \u211d : Type\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  t_stat_value\ngroup1_mean\u271d group2_mean\u271d group1_stddev\u271d group2_stddev\u271d : \u211d\ngroup1_size\u271d group2_size\u271d : \u2115\ngroup1_mean : \u2115 := 72\ngroup2_mean : \u2115 := 68\ngroup1_stddev : \u2115 := 4\ngroup2_stddev : \u2115 := 5\ngroup1_size : \u2115 := 14\ngroup2_size : \u2115 := 12\nt_stat_value : \u211d := t_stat (\u2191group1_mean) (\u2191group2_mean) (\u2191group1_stddev) (\u2191group2_stddev) group1_size group2_size\nh : t_stat_value = 2.22\n\u22a2 sorryAx (Sort u_1) true\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\ncompiler IR check failed at 'critical_t_value', error: unknown declaration 'Real.decidableEq'\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'let'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

In a right-angled isosceles triangle, the two legs are equal in length, and the hypotenuse is opposite the right angle. Given that the hypotenuse is the diameter of the circle, its length is 2 units (twice the radius).\n\nSince the triangle is isosceles and right-angled, both legs have the same length.

Setting Up Hypotheses:**\nFor both the real and imaginary parts, we'll set up the following hypotheses:\n- **Null Hypothesis (H\u2080):** The sample mean is equal to the population mean.\n- **Alternative Hypothesis (H\u2081):** The sample mean is different from the population mean.\n\n**3. Choosing the Right Test:**\nGiven that the sample size is 30, which is moderately large, and we know the standard deviations, we'll use the **Z-test** for both parts.\n\n**4. Calculating the Test Statistics:**\n- **For the Real Parts:**\n  - **Difference in Means:** 4.8 (sample) - 5 (population) = -0.2\n  - **Standard Error (SE):** Standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size. SE = 1 / \u221a30 \u2248 0.183\n  - **Z-Score:** Difference in means / SE = -0.2 / 0.183 \u2248 -1.09\n\n- **For the Imaginary Parts:**\n  - **Difference in Means:** 2.9 (sample) - 3 (population) = -0.1\n  - **Standard Error (SE):** 0.8 / \u221a30 \u2248 0.146\n  - **Z-Score:** -0.1 / 0.146 \u2248 -0.68\n\n**5. Determining the Critical Value:**\nAt a 5% significance level for a two-tailed test, the critical Z-scores are approximately \u00b11.96.

Conclusion:**\nSince neither the Z-score for the real parts nor the imaginary parts exceeds the critical values, we do not have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis for either component.

This means the rectangular parallelepiped is actually a cube in this scenario, as all its sides are equal.\n\n4. **Calculating the Volume \\( V \\):**\n   - The volume of the parallelepiped (which is a cube in this case) is given by:\n     \\[\n     V = a \\times b \\times c = a \\times a \\times a = a^3\n     \\]\n\n5. **Calculating the Surface Area \\( S \\) of the Sphere:**\n   - The surface area of a sphere is given by:\n     \\[\n     S = 4\\pi r^2\n     \\]\n   - Since \\( r = \\frac{a}{2} \\), substituting this into the formula gives:\n     \\[\n     S = 4\\pi \\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right)^2 = 4\\pi \\left(\\frac{a^2}{4}\\right) = \\pi a^2\n     \\]\n\n6. **Finding \\( V/S \\):**\n   - Now, divide the volume by the surface area:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{V}{S} = \\frac{a^3}{\\pi a^2} = \\frac{a}{\\pi}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the value of \\( V/S \\) in terms of \\( a \\), \\( b \\), \\( c \\), and \\( \\pi \\) is \\( \\frac{a}{\\pi} \\), with the understanding that \\( a = b = c \\) for the sphere to be inscribed and touch all six faces of the parallelepiped.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unsolved goals\na b c : \u211d\nh : a = b \u2227 b = c\nV : \u211d := a * b * c\nS : \u211d := 4 * \u03c0 * (a / 2) ^ 2\n\u22a2 c ^ 3 * \u03c0 * c\u207b\u00b9 ^ 2 * \u03c0\u207b\u00b9 = c\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: ambiguous, possible interpretations \n  \u03c0 : \u2115 \u2192 \u2115\n  \n  \u03c0 : \u211d\nambiguous, possible interpretations \n  \u03c0 : \u2115 \u2192 \u2115\n  \n  \u03c0 : \u211d\nsimp made no progress\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: ambiguous, possible interpretations \n  \u03c0 : \u2115 \u2192 \u2115\n  \n  \u03c0 : \u211d\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\nambiguous, possible interpretations \n  \u03c0 : \u2115 \u2192 \u2115\n  \n  \u03c0 : \u211d\nambiguous, possible interpretations \n  \u03c0 : \u2115 \u2192 \u2115\n  \n  \u03c0 : \u211d\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  V a a a\na b c : \u211d\nh : a = b \u2227 b = c\nh1 : a = b\nh2 : b = c\nV_eq : V a a a = a ^ 3\nS_eq : S a = sorryAx \u211d true * a ^ 2\n\u22a2 V c c c / S c = c / sorryAx \u211d true\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "# Informal Proof:\n\nLet's begin by considering the concept of \"slope\" in the context of a two-dimensional vector space. For any vector, the slope is determined by the ratio of its vertical component to its horizontal component. Specifically, if we have a vector \\( w = (w_x, w_y) \\), its slope is \\( \\frac{w_y}{w_x} \\), provided \\( w_x \\) is not zero.\n\nNow, let's examine the vectors \\( u \\) and \\( v \\) in our vector space \\( V \\). Suppose vector \\( u \\) has components \\( (u_x, u_y) \\) and vector \\( v \\) has components \\( (v_x, v_y) \\). According to the problem, the slope of \\( u \\) is twice the slope of \\( v \\). Mathematically, this relationship can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{u_y}{u_x} = 2 \\cdot \\frac{v_y}{v_x}\n\\]\n\nThis equation tells us that for every unit increase in the horizontal direction of \\( u \\), its vertical component increases twice as much compared to \\( v \\).\n\nNext, we consider the vector resulting from the operation \\( cu + v \\), where \\( c \\) is a scalar. Scaling vector \\( u \\) by \\( c \\) gives us a new vector \\( cu = (c u_x, c u_y) \\). Adding vector \\( v \\) to this scaled vector yields:\n\n\\[\ncu + v = (c u_x + v_x, c u_y + v_y)\n\\]\n\nThe slope of this new vector is therefore:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{c u_y + v_y}{c u_x + v_x}\n\\]\n\nOur goal is to show that this slope is equal to the slope of \\( u \\), which is \\( \\frac{u_y}{u_x} \\).\n\nTo see why this is true, let's observe the relationship between the components. Since the slope of \\( u \\) is twice that of \\( v \\), we can substitute \\( u_y \\) with \\( 2 \\frac{u_x}{v_x} v_y \\) based on the initial slope relationship. This substitution ensures that when we scale \\( u \\) by \\( c \\) and add \\( v \\), the proportional increase in both the horizontal and vertical components maintains the slope consistent with that of \\( u \\).\n\nIn essence, the contribution of \\( v \\) adjusts the resulting vector \\( cu + v \\) in such a way that the overall direction aligns with \\( u \\)'s slope. The scaling factor \\( c \\) amplifies \\( u \\)'s influence, and the specific slope relationship ensures that the addition of \\( v \\) doesn't alter the slope but rather complements it to maintain the alignment.\n\nTherefore, through this proportional reasoning and the interplay between the components of \\( u \\) and \\( v \\), we can conclude that the slope of the vector \\( cu + v \\) is indeed equal to the slope of \\( u \\).",

We want to see how much \\( F(s) \\) differs from \\( F(s_0) \\). Consider the difference:\n\\[\nF(s) - F(s_0) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\left( e^{-st} - e^{-s_0 t} \\right) f(t) \\, dt.\n\\]\nBecause \\( s \\) is close to \\( s_0 \\), the exponential terms \\( e^{-st} \\) and \\( e^{-s_0 t} \\) are nearly the same, especially for each fixed \\( t \\). The difference \\( e^{-st} - e^{-s_0 t} \\) becomes small as \\( s \\) approaches \\( s_0 \\).\n\nSince \\( f(t) \\) is continuous, it doesn't introduce any abrupt changes that could cause the integral to behave unpredictably. Moreover, the exponential functions ensure that the integrand decays suitably as \\( t \\) becomes large, preventing issues with convergence.\n\nBy the properties of integrals and continuous functions, small changes in \\( s \\) lead to small changes in the integrand \\( e^{-st} f(t) \\). Because the integral aggregates these small changes over the entire domain from \\( 0 \\) to \\( \\infty \\), the overall difference \\( F(s) - F(s_0) \\) remains small when \\( s \\) is close to \\( s_0 \\).\n\nTherefore, as \\( s \\) approaches \\( s_0 \\), \\( F(s) \\) approaches \\( F(s_0) \\) smoothly, ensuring that \\( F(s) \\) is continuous with respect to \\( s \\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: invalid field notation, type is not of the form (C ...) where C is a constant\n  set\nhas type\n  ?m.242 \u2192 ?m.243 PUnit.{?u.241 + 1}\nunknown identifier 'real.exp'\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.measureSpace', and it does not have executable code\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: expected token\ninvalid binder annotation, type is not a class instance\n  Continuous f\nuse the command `set_option checkBinderAnnotations false` to disable the check\nunknown identifier 'continuous_of_continuous_on_of_isCompact'\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: expected token\nunknown identifier 'continuous_of_continuous_on_of_isCompact'\nPlease revise the proof.",

According to the dataset provided, the minimum value of \\( f(x) \\) on \\([a, b]\\) is \\( k \\) and the maximum value is \\( m \\).\n\nLet's first consider the lower bound. Because \\( f(x) \\) is always at least \\( k \\) throughout the interval \\([a, b]\\), the area under the curve \\( f(x) \\) from \\( a \\) to \\( b \\) (which represents the definite integral \\( \\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \\, dx \\)) cannot be less than the area of a rectangle with height \\( k \\) and width \\( (b - a) \\). Mathematically, this means:\n\\[\n\\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \\, dx \\geq k \\times (b - a)\n\\]\nThis inequality holds because every value of \\( f(x) \\) contributes at least \\( k \\) to the integral across the entire interval.\n\nSimilarly, for the upper bound, since \\( f(x) \\) never exceeds \\( m \\) on \\([a, b]\\), the area under \\( f(x) \\) cannot be greater than the area of a rectangle with height \\( m \\) and width \\( (b - a) \\). Therefore:\n\\[\n\\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \\, dx \\leq m \\times (b - a)\n\\]\nThis inequality ensures that the integral does not surpass the maximum possible area defined by the constant function \\( m \\) over the interval.\n\nCombining these two results, we conclude that the definite integral of \\( f(x) \\) from \\( a \\) to \\( b \\) is always at least \\( (b - a)k \\) and at most \\( (b - a)m \\). This establishes that:\n\\[\n(b - a)k \\leq \\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \\, dx \\leq (b - a)m\n\\]\nThus, the integral of \\( f(x) \\) over \\([a, b]\\) is bounded below by \\( (b - a)k \\) and above by \\( (b -

For example, using the second derivative (Hessian) test can help determine whether the critical point is a local maximum, local minimum, or a saddle point.\n\nSince the problem statement only provides information about the first partial derivatives being zero and does not supply any details about the second partial derivatives or the overall behavior of \\( f \\) near \\( (a, b) \\), we cannot conclusively determine that \\( f \\) has a local extremum at \\( (a, b) \\) based solely on the given information. Without additional conditions or analysis of the function's curvature, \\( (a, b) \\) could be a point of inflection or a saddle point rather than a local maximum or minimum.\n\nTherefore, while the vanishing of the first partial derivatives at \\( (a, b) \\) identifies it as a critical point, further investigation is required to establish the existence of a local extremum at that point.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unexpected token '\u2202'; expected term\nunexpected token '\u2202'; expected term\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unexpected token '\u2202'; expected term\nunexpected token '\u2202'; expected term\nfunction expected at\n  IsLocalExtrAt\nterm has type\n  ?m.1839\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unexpected token '\u2202'; expected term\nunexpected token '\u2202'; expected term\nfunction expected at\n  IsLocalExtrAt\nterm has type\n  ?m.1839\nPlease revise the proof.",

A negative number can be thought of as the opposite of a positive number. For example, if **a** is negative, it can be expressed as **a = -x**, where **x** is a positive number. Similarly, **b = -y**, where **y** is also positive.\n\nNow, let's look at the product of **a** and **b**:\n\\[ a \\times b = (-x) \\times (-y) \\]\n\nWhen we multiply these two negative numbers together, we essentially have two \"opposite\" directions being applied:\n\n1. **First Negative Sign (-x):** This can be viewed as taking the opposite of **x**, flipping it from positive to negative.\n2. **Second Negative Sign (-y):** Similarly, this takes the opposite of **y**, flipping it from positive to negative.\n\nMultiplying two negatives involves applying two opposites. The first negative flips the number to the opposite side of zero, and the second negative flips it back to the original side. Think of it like turning around twice: first, you face the opposite direction, and then turning around again brings you back to where you started.\n\nMathematically, multiplying two negatives cancels out the negative signs:\n\\[ (-x) \\times (-y) = x \\times y \\]\n\nSince **x** and **y** are both positive, their product **x \u00d7 y** is also positive. Therefore, the product of **a** and **b**:\n\\[ a \\times b = (-x) \\times (-y) = x \\times y \\]\nis positive.\n\nIn summary, multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive product because the two negative signs effectively cancel each other out, leading to a positive result.",

To find the median of this set, we first arrange all the numbers in ascending order. Since \\( n \\) is even, there is no single middle number that divides the set into two equal halves. Instead, there are two central numbers that sit exactly in the middle of the ordered list.\n\nSpecifically, these two middle numbers are the \\( \\frac{n}{2} \\)th number and the \\( \\left(\\frac{n}{2} + 1\\right) \\)th number. For example, if there are 10 numbers, the 5th and 6th numbers in the ordered list are the central ones. To determine the median, we take the average of these two central numbers. \n\nThis averaging process ensures that the median accurately represents the middle point of the dataset, effectively splitting the set into two halves with an equal number of values below and above the median. By using the \\( \\frac{n}{2} \\)th and \\( \\left(\\frac{n}{2} + 1\\right) \\)th numbers and averaging them, we obtain a value that best represents the central tendency of the entire set when there is an even number of elements.\nPrevious attempt failed with: invalid field 'sort', the environment does not contain 'List.sort'\n  l\nhas type\n  List \u2115\ninvalid field notation, type is not of the form (C ...) where C is a constant\n  sorted\nhas type\n  ?m.11\ninvalid field notation, type is not of the form (C ...) where C is a constant\n  sorted\nhas type\n  ?m.11\nunknown constant 'List.get!_eq_get'\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, equality or iff proof expected\n  ?m.12480\nn : \u2115\nl : List \u2115\nh : n = l.length\nh_even : n % 2 = 0\n\u22a2 sorryAx (\u2115 \u2192 List \u2115 \u2192 \u2115) true l.length l = (l.getD (l.length / 2 - 1) 0 + l.getD (l.length / 2) 0) / 2\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: invalid field 'sort', the environment does not contain 'List.sort'\n  l\nhas type\n  List \u2115\ninvalid field notation, type is not of the form (C ...) where C is a constant\n  sorted\nhas type\n  ?m.8\ninvalid field notation, type is not of the form (C ...) where C is a constant\n  sorted\nhas type\n  ?m.8\ninvalid field notation, type is not of the form (C ...) where C is a constant\n  sorted\nhas type\n  ?m.8\ninvalid field notation, type is not of the form (C ...) where C is a constant\n  sorted\nhas type\n  ?m.8\ninvalid field 'sort', the environment does not contain 'List.sort'\n  l\nhas type\n  List \u2115\ninvalid field 'sort', the environment does not contain 'List.sort'\n  l\nhas type\n  List \u2115\nunsolved goals\nl : List \u2115\nh : l.length % 2 = 0\n\u22a2 sorryAx (List \u2115 \u2192 \u2115) true l = (sorryAx \u2115 true + sorryAx \u2115 true) / 2\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: invalid field 'sort', the environment does not contain 'List.sort'\n  l\nhas type\n  List \u2115\ninvalid field notation, type is not of the form (C ...) where C is a constant\n  sorted\nhas type\n  ?m.8\nfailed to prove index is valid, possible solutions:\n  - Use `have`-expressions to prove the index is valid\n  - Use `a[i]!` notation instead, runtime check is perfomed, and 'Panic' error message is produced if index is not valid\n  - Use `a[i]?` notation instead, result is an `Option` type\n  - Use `a[i]'h` notation instead, where `h` is a proof that index is valid\nl : List \u2115\nsorted : ?m.8 := sorryAx ?m.8 true\nn : \u2115 := sorryAx \u2115 true\n\u22a2 ?m.1617 sorted (n / 2 - 1)\nfailed to prove index is valid, possible solutions:\n  - Use `have`-expressions to prove the index is valid\n  - Use `a[i]!` notation instead, runtime check is perfomed, and 'Panic' error message is produced if index is not valid\n  - Use `a[i]?` notation instead, result is an `Option` type\n  - Use `a[i]'h` notation instead, where `h` is a proof that index is valid\nl : List \u2115\nsorted : ?m.8 := sorryAx ?m.8 true\nn : \u2115 := sorryAx \u2115 true\n\u22a2 ?m.1623 sorted (n / 2)\nfailed to prove index is valid, possible solutions:\n  - Use `have`-expressions to prove the index is valid\n  - Use `a[i]!` notation instead, runtime check is perfomed, and 'Panic' error message is produced if index is not valid\n  - Use `a[i]?` notation instead, result is an `Option` type\n  - Use `a[i]'h` notation instead, where `h` is a proof that index is valid\nl : List \u2115\nsorted : ?m.8 := sorryAx ?m.8 true\nn : \u2115 := sorryAx \u2115 true\n\u22a2 ?m.1629 sorted (n / 2)\ninvalid field 'sort', the environment does not contain 'List.sort'\n  l\nhas type\n  List \u2115\ninvalid field 'sort', the environment does not contain 'List.sort'\n  l\nhas type\n  List \u2115\nfailed to prove index is valid, possible solutions:\n  - Use `have`-expressions to prove the index is valid\n  - Use `a[i]!` notation instead, runtime check is perfomed, and 'Panic' error message is produced if index is not valid\n  - Use `a[i]?` notation instead, result is an `Option` type\n  - Use `a[i]'h` notation instead, where `h` is a proof that index is valid\nl : List \u2115\nh : l.length % 2 = 0\n\u22a2 ?m.11040 (sorryAx ?m.11036 true) (l.length / 2 - 1)\nfailed to prove index is valid, possible solutions:\n  - Use `have`-expressions to prove the index is valid\n  - Use `a[i]!` notation instead, runtime check is perfomed, and 'Panic' error message is produced if index is not valid\n  - Use `a[i]?` notation instead, result is an `Option` type\n  - Use `a[i]'h` notation instead, where `h` is a proof that index is valid\nl : List \u2115\nh : l.length % 2 = 0\n\u22a2 ?m.11254 (sorryAx ?m.11250 true) (l.length / 2)\nsimp made no progress\nPlease revise the proof.",

Additionally, we want to express the solution in a new coordinate system defined by the basis vectors \\( \\mathbf{v}_1 = (1, 0) \\) and \\( \\mathbf{v}_2 = (0, 1) \\).\n\n**Step 1: Solving the Differential Equation**\n\nFirst, let's solve the differential equation \\( y'' - y = 0 \\). This is a homogeneous linear differential equation with constant coefficients. To find the general solution, we look for solutions of the form \\( y = e^{rx} \\). Plugging this into the equation gives:\n\n\\[\nr^2 e^{rx} - e^{rx} = 0 \\implies e^{rx}(r^2 - 1) = 0\n\\]\n\nSince \\( e^{rx} \\) is never zero, we set the characteristic equation \\( r^2 - 1 = 0 \\). Solving for \\( r \\), we find two real roots: \\( r = 1 \\) and \\( r = -1 \\).\n\nTherefore, the general solution to the differential equation is a linear combination of these exponential functions:\n\n\\[\ny(x) = A e^{x} + B e^{-x}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are constants determined by the boundary conditions.\n\n**Step 2: Applying Boundary Conditions**\n\nNext, we apply the given boundary conditions to find the specific values of \\( A \\) and \\( B \\).\n\n1. **First Boundary Condition (\\( y(0) = 1 \\))**:\n\n   Substituting \\( x = 0 \\) into the general solution:\n\n   \\[\n   y(0) = A e^{0} + B e^{0} = A + B = 1\n   \\]\n\n   This gives us the equation:\n\n   \\[\n   A + B = 1 \\quad \\text{(Equation 1)}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Second Boundary Condition (\\( y'(0) = 0 \\))**:\n\n   First, we find the derivative of \\( y(x) \\):\n\n   \\[\n   y'(x) = A e^{x} - B e^{-x}\n   \\]\n\n   Substituting \\( x = 0 \\):\n\n   \\[\n   y'(0) = A e^{0} - B e^{0} = A - B = 0\n   \\]\n\n   This gives us the equation:\n\n   \\[\n   A - B = 0 \\quad \\text{(Equation 2)}\n   \\]\n\n**Step 3: Solving for Constants \\( A \\) and \\( B \\)**\n\nWe now have a system of two equations:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\nA + B = 1 \\\\\nA - B = 0\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nAdding the two equations:\n\n\\[\n2A = 1 \\implies A = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( A = \\frac{1}{2} \\) into Equation 2:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} - B = 0 \\implies B = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Writing the Particular Solution**\n\nSubstituting \\( A = \\frac{1}{2} \\) and \\( B = \\frac{1}{2} \\) back into the general solution:\n\n\\[\ny(x) = \\frac{1}{2} e^{x} + \\frac{1}{2} e^{-x} = \\cosh(x)\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( \\cosh(x) \\) is the hyperbolic cosine function, representing the particular solution that satisfies both boundary conditions.\n\n**Step 5: Expressing in the New Coordinate System**\n\nThe new coordinate system is defined by the basis vectors \\( \\mathbf{v}_1 = (1, 0) \\) and \\( \\mathbf{v}_2 = (0, 1) \\). In this context, any vector or function can be expressed as a linear combination of these basis vectors. Since \\( \\mathbf{v}_1 \\) and \\( \\mathbf{v}_2 \\) are the standard basis vectors in a two-dimensional space, expressing the solution \\( y(x) \\) in this coordinate system simply involves representing it as:\n\n\\[\ny(x) = \\cosh(x) \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_1 + 0 \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_2 = \\cosh(x) \\mathbf{v}_1\n\\]\n\nThis means that in the new coordinate system, the solution lies entirely along the direction of \\( \\mathbf{v}_1 \\) with no component in the direction of \\( \\mathbf{v}_2 \\).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBy solving the differential equation \\( y'' - y = 0 \\) with the given boundary conditions, we found that the solution is \\( y(x) = \\cosh(x) \\). Expressed in the new coordinate system defined by \\( \\mathbf{v}_1 = (1, 0) \\) and \\( \\mathbf{v}_2 = (0, 1) \\), the solution aligns entirely with the \\( \\mathbf{v}_1 \\) direction, effectively being \\( \\cosh(x) \\) times the first basis vector.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.cosh', and it does not have executable code\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\ncompiler IR check failed at 'solution_in_new_coords', error: unknown declaration 'solution'\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: ambiguous, possible interpretations \n  _root_.cosh x : \u211d\n  \n  x.cosh : \u211d\ncompiler IR check failed at 'solution_in_new_coords', error: unknown declaration 'solution'\nambiguous, possible interpretations \n  _root_.cosh : \u211d \u2192 \u211d\n  \n  Real.cosh : \u211d \u2192 \u211d\nunsolved goals\n\u22a2 sorryAx \u211d true = boundary_condition_1\nambiguous, possible interpretations \n  _root_.cosh : \u211d \u2192 \u211d\n  \n  Real.cosh : \u211d \u2192 \u211d\nambiguous, possible interpretations \n  _root_.deriv_cosh : DifferentiableAt \u211d ?m.985 ?m.986 \u2192\n    deriv (fun x => (?m.985 x).cosh) ?m.986 = (?m.985 ?m.986).sinh * deriv ?m.985 ?m.986\n  \n  Real.deriv_cosh : deriv Real.cosh = sinh\nsimp made no progress\nambiguous, possible interpretations \n  _root_.cosh : \u211d \u2192 \u211d\n  \n  Real.cosh : \u211d \u2192 \u211d\nambiguous, possible interpretations \n  _root_.deriv_cosh : DifferentiableAt \u211d ?m.1751 ?m.1752 \u2192\n    deriv (fun x => (?m.1751 x).cosh) ?m.1752 = (?m.1751 ?m.1752).sinh * deriv ?m.1751 ?m.1752\n  \n  Real.deriv_cosh : deriv Real.cosh = sinh\nunsolved goals\nx : \u211d\n\u22a2 deriv (deriv solution) x - sorryAx \u211d true = 0\nambiguous, possible interpretations \n  _root_.cosh x : \u211d\n  \n  x.cosh : \u211d\nambiguous, possible interpretations \n  _root_.cosh : \u211d \u2192 \u211d\n  \n  Real.cosh : \u211d \u2192 \u211d\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'y'''\nunknown identifier 'y''\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.cosh', and it does not have executable code\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\ncompiler IR check failed at 'solution_in_new_coords', error: unknown declaration 'Real.cosh'\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",
