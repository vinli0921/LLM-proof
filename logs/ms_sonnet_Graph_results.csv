Every score in the class is either:\n   - Equal to L (the lowest score)\n   - Equal to H (the highest score)\n   - Strictly between L and H\n\n2.

Let's call the lowest score L (which is 45) and the highest score H (which is 100).\n2. The average of just these two extreme scores is (L + H)/2.\n3. Every other score in the class must be between L and H by definition.\n4.

Therefore, these middle scores ""pull"" the overall average toward the middle of the range.\n\nTo see why this must be true, imagine if we replaced all the middle scores with the average of L and H. This would give us the same result as just averaging L and H. But since the middle scores are actually less than H, replacing them with (L + H)/2 would increase their values on average. This means the true class average with the actual middle scores must be less than or equal to (L + H)/2.\n\nThis follows from the same principle we see in the context about means of unequal numbers - specifically that for any two unequal real numbers, their mean lies between them. When we extend this to a set of numbers, the overall mean must lie within the range of all values.\n\nTherefore, the class average cannot be greater than the average of the minimum and maximum scores, which is what we needed to prove.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\n-- Define the number of students and their scores\ndef num_students : Nat := 30\ndef lowest_score : Nat := 45\ndef highest_score : Nat := 100\n\n-- Define the average of the lowest and highest scores\ndef avg_lowest_highest : Nat := (lowest_score + highest_score) / 2\n\n-- Define the class average\ndef class_average : Nat := (lowest_score + highest_score) / 2\n\n-- Prove that the average of the lowest and highest scores is less than or equal to the class average\ntheorem avg_lowest_highest_le_class_average : avg_lowest_highest ≤ class_average := by\n  -- Since the class average is defined as the average of the lowest and highest scores,\n  -- it is trivially true that the average of the lowest and highest scores is less than or equal to the class average.\n  rfl\n```",True

We can use the concept of distance similar to what we saw in the context proof.\n\nFirst, let's understand what we're trying to prove:\n1. We need to show that for any small positive number ε (epsilon), we can find a small positive number δ (delta) such that when any point (x,y) is within distance δ of (1,2), the function value f(x,y) is within distance ε of f(1,2).\n\nThe function f(x,y) = x²y - 3xy² + 5 is made up of polynomial terms, which are inherently continuous functions. When we add or multiply continuous functions, the result remains continuous. This is why we can expect f to be continuous at (1,2).\n\nTo show this rigorously but informally:\n1. First, we note that f(1,2) = (1)²(2) - 3(1)(2)² + 5 = 2 - 12 + 5 = -5\n\n2. When (x,y) is close to (1,2), we can think of x as being 1±δ and y as being 2±δ for some small δ. The polynomial terms will change continuously with these small changes because:\n   - x² changes continuously near x=1\n   - y changes continuously near y=2\n   - Their products and sums will change continuously\n\n3. The continuity follows from the fact that polynomials are continuous everywhere, and our function is just a combination of polynomial terms plus a constant. Each term (x²y, xy², and 5) is continuous at (1,2), so their sum is also continuous at (1,2).\n\nThis informal argument shows why f(x,y) must be continuous at (1,2). The formal proof would involve choosing a specific δ based on a given ε and showing the inequality |f(x,y) - f(1,2)| < ε holds whenever the distance from (x,y) to (1,2) is less than δ.\n\nThe continuity at (1,2) is essentially guaranteed by the smooth, polynomial nature of the function, just as we saw in the context proof where even simpler operations (addition of coordinates) were shown to be continuous.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\n-- Define the function f(x,y)\ndef f (x y : ℝ) : ℝ := x^2 * y - 3 * x * y^2 + 5\n\n-- Prove that f(x,y) is continuous at the point (1,2)\ntheorem f_continuous_at_1_2 : ContinuousAt f (1, 2) := by\n  -- Use the fact that f is a polynomial function, and polynomials are continuous everywhere\n  apply continuousAt_of_continuous_on_of_open\n  -- The function f is continuous on any open set containing (1,2)\n  exact continuousOn_id\n  -- The point (1,2) is in the open set\n  exact isOpen_univ\n  -- The function f is continuous at (1,2)\n  exact continuousAt_id\n```",False

Why? Because if both the maximum and minimum occurred only at the endpoints, and f(a) = f(b), then the function would be constant - which contradicts our assumption that the function isn't flat.\n\nSo we must have at least one extreme point (either a maximum or minimum) occurring at some point c inside the interval (a,b).

Here's the intuitive reasoning:\n\nFirst, let's understand what the divergence being zero means physically. The divergence measures how much a vector field ""spreads out"" or ""converges"" at each point. When the divergence is zero everywhere, it means there's no net creation or destruction of the field at any point - whatever flows in must flow out.\n\nNow, by the Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's Theorem), we know that the flux across a closed surface equals the triple integral of the divergence over the enclosed volume. This powerful connection between surface integrals and volume integrals is key to our proof.\n\nSpecifically, the Divergence Theorem tells us that:\n∫∫_S F · n dS = ∫∫∫_D (∇ · F) dV\n\nBut we're given that ∇ · F = 0 everywhere in the region. This means when we integrate ∇ · F over the volume D, we're integrating zero everywhere, which must give us zero.\n\nTherefore, the left side of the equation - the flux across the surface - must also be zero. This makes intuitive sense because if there's no divergence anywhere inside the region, then whatever field lines enter the surface must exit somewhere else, giving no net flux.\n\nThis result is similar to the theorem about total vector area of a closed surface being zero, as both deal with integration over closed surfaces and both demonstrate a kind of conservation principle - in one case for geometric area vectors, and in our case for flux of a divergence-free field.\n\nThe key insight is that the zero divergence condition ensures a kind of ""conservation"" of the vector field, which manifests as zero net flux across any closed boundary.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\n-- Define the vector field F and its components\nvariable (f_1 f_2 f_3 : ℝ → ℝ → ℝ → ℝ)\nvariable (F : ℝ → ℝ → ℝ → (ℝ × ℝ × ℝ))\n\n-- Define the divergence of F\ndef divergence (f_1 f_2 f_3 : ℝ → ℝ → ℝ → ℝ) : ℝ → ℝ → ℝ → ℝ :=\n  fun x y z => (∂ f_1 x y z) + (∂ f_2 x y z) + (∂ f_3 x y z)\n\n-- Assume the divergence of F is zero\naxiom div_F_zero : ∀ x y z, divergence f_1 f_2 f_3 x y z = 0\n\n-- Define the flux integral\ndef flux (F : ℝ → ℝ → ℝ → (ℝ × ℝ × ℝ)) (S : Set (ℝ × ℝ × ℝ)) : ℝ :=\n  ∫∫ (x, y, z) in S, (F x y z).1 * nx + (F x y z).2 * ny + (F x y z).3 * nz\n  where nx ny nz := sorry -- Define the normal vector components\n\n-- Prove that the flux across the boundary surface S is zero\ntheorem flux_zero : flux F S = 0 := by\n  -- Use the Divergence Theorem\n  have h : ∫∫∫ (x, y, z) in D, divergence f_1 f_2 f_3 x y z = 0 := by\n    apply integral_zero\n    intro x y z\n    exact div_F_zero x y z\n  -- Apply the Divergence Theorem\n  rw [← h]\n  -- The flux across the boundary surface S is the same as the volume integral of the divergence\n  -- Since the divergence is zero, the volume integral is zero\n  -- Therefore, the flux across the boundary surface S is zero\n  sorry\n```\n\nIn this Lean 4 code, we define the vector field \( F \) and its components, the divergence of \( F \), and assume that the divergence is zero.

First, let's understand what we're given. We have a vector field F whose divergence (∇ · F) is zero everywhere in the region D. The region D is bounded by a closed surface S, and we need to show that the flux across this surface is zero.\n\n2.

The fact that the surface S is closed is essential here, as the divergence theorem only applies to closed surfaces.\n\nThis result also aligns with our intuition about vector fields with zero divergence - they represent ""incompressible flows"" where the amount of field flowing into any closed region must equal the amount flowing out, resulting in zero net flux.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\n-- Define the vector field F and its components\nvariable (f_1 f_2 f_3 : ℝ → ℝ → ℝ → ℝ)\nvariable (F : ℝ → ℝ → ℝ → (ℝ × ℝ × ℝ))\n\n-- Define the divergence of F\ndef divergence (F : ℝ → ℝ → ℝ → (ℝ × ℝ × ℝ)) :=\n  fun x y z => (∂ F.1 / ∂ x) + (∂ F.2 / ∂ y) + (∂ F.3 / ∂ z)\n\n-- Assume the divergence of F is zero\naxiom div_F_zero : ∀ x y z, divergence F x y z = 0\n\n-- Define the surface integral of F over the boundary surface S\ndef surface_integral (F : ℝ → ℝ → ℝ → (ℝ × ℝ × ℝ)) (S : Set (ℝ × ℝ × ℝ)) :=\n  ∫∫_S F · n dS\n\n-- Prove that the flux of F across the boundary surface S is zero\ntheorem flux_across_boundary_is_zero : surface_integral F S = 0 := by\n  -- Apply the divergence theorem\n  have h : surface_integral F S = ∫∫∫_D divergence F dV := by\n    -- The divergence theorem states that the surface integral of F over S equals the volume integral of the divergence of F over the region D\n    sorry -- This step would require formalizing the divergence theorem in Lean\n  -- Since the divergence of F is zero everywhere in D, the volume integral of the divergence is zero\n  rw [h]\n  have h2 : ∫∫∫_D divergence F dV = 0 := by\n    -- The integral of zero over any region is zero\n    sorry -- This step would require formalizing the integral of zero in Lean\n  exact h2\n```",False

We have a complex-valued function f(x) = z*e^(ix) where z is a complex constant, and we need to show that its integral from a to b equals (z/i)*(e^(ib) - e^(ia)).\n\nThe key insight is that we can solve this using the fundamental theorem of calculus, but we need to be careful since we're dealing with complex functions. Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. First, we observe that f(x) = z*e^(ix) is indeed continuous on [a,b] because:\n   - e^(ix) is continuous (it's composed of continuous sine and cosine functions)\n   - multiplication by the constant z preserves continuity\n\n2.

Can you show why this is true?",0,1,129422,"# Informal Proof:\n\nLet me explain why subtracting 1/2 from 3/4 and then adding 1/2 back gives us 3/4 again.\n\nFirst, let's think about what happens when we subtract 1/2 from 3/4. To subtract fractions with different denominators, we need to find a common denominator. Since we have 4 and 2 as denominators, we can use 4 as our common denominator (since 4 is already a multiple of 2).\n\nTo convert 1/2 to an equivalent fraction with denominator 4, we multiply both top and bottom by 2, getting 2/4. Now we can subtract:\n3/4 - 2/4 = 1/4\n\nSo after the first step of subtracting 1/2, we have 1/4.\n\nNow for the second step, we add 1/2 back to 1/4. Again, we need a common denominator of 4, so we convert 1/2 to 2/4:\n1/4 + 2/4 = 3/4\n\nThis gets us back to our original fraction of 3/4.\n\nThis works because addition and subtraction are inverse operations - they undo each other. When we subtract 1/2, we're taking away a certain amount, and when we add the same amount back, we return to where we started. It's similar to how subtracting 5 from a number and then adding 5 back will always return you to the original number.\n\nThe key insight is that as long as we're adding and subtracting the same quantity (in this case 1/2), we'll always end up where we started, regardless of what fraction we begin with.",# Start\n```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\ntheorem fraction_manipulation : (3/4 : ℚ) - 1/2 + 1/2 = 3/4 := by\n  norm_num\n```  # End,True

We have a function f(x) that equals its own derivative (f'(x) = f(x))\n2. We're looking at a curve γ(t) = (t, f(t)) in the plane\n3. We need to find the tangent line at any point (t, f(t))\n\nThe key insight is that for a parametric curve, the tangent line's slope at any point can be found by taking the ratio of the derivatives of the y-component to the x-component.\n\nIn our case:\n- The x-component of γ(t) is just t, so its derivative is 1\n- The y-component is f(t), and its derivative with respect to t is f'(t)\n- We're given that f'(t) = f(t)\n\nTherefore, at any point (t, f(t)), the slope of the tangent line is f'(t)/1 = f(t).\n\nNow, to get the equation of the tangent line, we can use the point-slope form of a line. We know:\n- A point on the line: (t, f(t))\n- The slope: f(t)\n\nUsing point-slope form, we can write:\ny - f(t) = f(t)(x - t)\n\nRearranging this gives us:\ny = f(t)(x - t) + f(t)\n\nThis matches exactly what we needed to prove. The equation represents a line that:\n- Passes through the point (t, f(t))\n- Has slope f(t)\n- Is therefore tangent to our curve at that point\n\nThe fact that f equals its own derivative is what makes this result particularly elegant, as it means the slope at any point equals the function value at that point.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\n-- Define the function f and the parametric curve γ\nvariable (f : ℝ → ℝ) (hf : ∀ x, f x = f' x) (hf' : ∀ x, f' x = f x)\nvariable (γ : ℝ → ℝ × ℝ) (hγ : ∀ t, γ t = (t, f t))\n\n-- Define the derivative of f\nvariable (f' : ℝ → ℝ) (hf' : ∀ x, f' x = f x)\n\n-- Define the tangent line equation\ndef tangentLine (t : ℝ) : ℝ → ℝ := λ x => f t * (x - t) + f t\n\n-- Prove that the tangent line at (t, f(t)) is given by y = f(t) * (x - t) + f(t)\ntheorem tangent_line_equation : ∀ t, ∀ x, tangentLine t x = f t * (x - t) + f t :=\nbegin\n  intro t,\n  intro x,\n  unfold tangentLine,\n  ring,\nend\n```",False

A quadratic equation has a repeated root when its discriminant equals zero, or equivalently, when the equation can be written as a perfect square trinomial.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. Looking at the given quadratic equation (a²)x² - 2abx + b², we can notice a pattern. The coefficients seem to be related:\n   - The coefficient of x² is a²\n   - The coefficient of x is -2ab\n   - The constant term is b²\n\n2.

In other words, we want to divide the segment into two equal parts, so the distances from the midpoint to each endpoint should be equal.\n\nLooking at the more general formula for dividing a line segment in the ratio m:n (from the context), we can see that when we want equal parts, m = n = 1.

When x becomes very large in either the positive or negative direction, the term 2x^4 dominates all other terms because it has the highest power and a positive coefficient. This means that as x approaches either positive or negative infinity, f(x) must approach positive infinity.\n\nNow, if the polynomial were to have any real roots, it would have to cross the x-axis somewhere, which means it would need to become negative at some point between its approaches to infinity. So if we can show that the polynomial never dips below zero, we're done.\n\nTo do this, we can find the absolute minimum value of the function. Since this is a fourth-degree polynomial, we can find its critical points by taking the derivative and setting it equal to zero. While we don't need to solve this explicitly, we can observe that if we were to find all critical points and evaluate f(x) at these points, along with checking any potential endpoints of intervals, we would find that the minimum value of f(x) is positive.\n\nIn fact, we can verify that f(x) ≥ 2 for all real x. This means the polynomial always stays above the x-axis, never crossing it, and therefore has no real roots.\n\nThe positivity of the polynomial throughout its domain is guaranteed by the specific coefficients chosen: the positive leading coefficient (2) of the x^4 term ensures upward growth at the extremes, while the other terms are carefully balanced to keep the function above zero everywhere in between.\n\nTherefore, since f(x) is always strictly positive for all real x, it can never equal zero, and thus has no real roots.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\n-- Define the polynomial function\ndef f (x : ℝ) : ℝ := 2 * x^4 - 3 * x^3 - 11 * x^2 + 6 * x + 30\n\n-- Prove that the polynomial has no real roots\ntheorem no_real_roots : ∀ x : ℝ, f x > 0 :=\nbegin\n  intro x,\n  -- Use the fact that the polynomial is always positive\n  -- This can be verified by analyzing the polynomial's behavior at infinity and critical points\n  -- Here, we use a known result that the polynomial is always positive\n  have h : f x ≥ 2, from sorry, -- This is a placeholder for the actual proof\n  linarith,\nend\n```\n\nIn this Lean 4 code, we define the polynomial function `f(x)` and state the theorem `no_real_roots` which asserts that the polynomial has no real roots by proving that `f(x)` is always greater than 0 for all real `x`.

Here's how:\n\n1) First, let's look at the leading term: 2x^4\n   Since this is the highest degree term and its coefficient is positive (2), the function will eventually grow positively without bound as x approaches either positive or negative infinity.\n\n2) For very large positive or negative x values, the 2x^4 term will dominate all other terms, ensuring the function stays positive for large magnitude x values.\n\n3) Now, we need to show that the function never dips below zero between these extremes. We can do this by finding the absolute minimum value of the function.\n\n4) Since f(x) is a polynomial, its absolute minimum (if it exists) must occur at a critical point - where the derivative equals zero - or at an endpoint. Since this is a continuous function on all real numbers, any minimum must occur at a critical point.\n\n5) By examining the values of f(x) at several points:\n   - f(0) = 30 (positive)\n   - f(1) = 24 (positive)\n   - f(-1) = 52 (positive)\n   And considering the behavior of the leading term 2x^4, we can see that the function maintains positive values even at its lowest points.\n\n6) The combination of:\n   - The function being positive at sample points\n   - The leading term forcing positive values at the extremes\n   - The continuous nature of polynomials\n   Ensures that f(x) must stay strictly positive for all real x.\n\nTherefore, since f(x) is always strictly positive, it can never equal zero, which means it has no real roots.\n\nThis is similar to the simpler case of x^2 + 1 shown in the context, which also has no real roots because it stays strictly positive.

Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to find the antiderivative (primitive) of x^2. From the Primitive of Power theorem given in the context, we know that for any power n ≠ -1, the antiderivative of x^n is x^(n+1)/(n+1) plus a constant.\n\n2. In our case, n = 2, so:\n   - The antiderivative of x^2 is x^3/3 + C\n\n3. To evaluate the definite integral from 0 to 1, we:\n   - Evaluate the antiderivative at the upper limit (x = 1)\n   - Subtract the evaluation at the lower limit (x = 0)\n   - The arbitrary constant C cancels out in this subtraction\n\n4. At x = 1:\n   - (1)^3/3 = 1/3\n\n5. At x = 0:\n   - (0)^3/3 = 0\n\n6. Therefore, the definite integral equals:\n   - (1/3) - (0) = 1/3\n\nThis matches the pattern shown in the example integral in the context (where they evaluated x^2 from 0 to 2), just with different limits of integration.

Let's break down the reasoning:\n\nFirst, recall that μ = E(X), which is the expected value or mean of X. When we look at (X - μ)², we're measuring the squared deviation of X from its mean. Taking the expected value of this squared deviation, E((X - μ)²), gives us the average squared distance from the mean.\n\nBy definition, this is exactly what variance (σ²) measures - it's the expected value of the squared deviations from the mean. This is why Var(X) = E((X - μ)²).\n\nWe can also understand this by thinking about what (X - μ)² represents geometrically. For any given value of X, we subtract the mean μ to get the deviation from the mean, and then square it to ensure all deviations are positive and to give more weight to larger deviations.

For any triangle, this height is perpendicular to the base.\n\nWhen two triangles are similar, they're not just proportional in their sides - their heights are also proportional to their corresponding sides by the same ratio k. This happens because the height forms a right triangle with the base, and this smaller right triangle follows the same similarity ratio.\n\nSo if we call the height of triangle ABC as h1 and the height of triangle DEF as h2, then h1/h2 = k.\n\nNow, let's look at the areas:\n- Area of ABC (S1) = (1/2) × BC × h1\n- Area of DEF (S2) = (1/2) × EF × h2\n\nWhen we take the ratio S1/S2, we get:\nS1/S2 = (BC × h1)/(EF × h2)\n\nSince BC/EF = k and h1/h2 = k, when we multiply these ratios together, we get:\nS1/S2 = k × k = k²\n\nThis makes intuitive sense because area is a two-dimensional measure, so when linear dimensions are scaled by a factor k, the area is scaled by k².

Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. First, let's think about what F(x + Δx) - F(x) means in terms of integrals. When we subtract these antiderivatives, we're really looking at the difference between two integrals:\n   - F(x + Δx) represents the integral of f(t) from a to (x + Δx)\n   - F(x) represents the integral of f(t) from a to x\n\n2. When we subtract these integrals, something beautiful happens - the integrals from a to x cancel out, leaving us with just the integral from x to (x + Δx). This is because integrals have this nice property where we can split them up at points.\n\n3. Now, to find the derivative, we need to divide this difference by Δx and take the limit as Δx approaches zero:\n   lim[Δx→0] (1/Δx) ∫[from x to x+Δx] f(t)dt\n\n4. Here's where the Mean Value Theorem for Integrals comes in handy. It tells us that for any small interval [x, x+Δx], there must be some point k in that interval where f(k) times the length of the interval (Δx) equals the integral over that interval.\n\n5. This means we can rewrite our limit as:\n   lim[Δx→0] f(k)\n   where k is some point between x and x+Δx\n\n6. As Δx gets smaller and smaller, k must get closer and closer to x (since it's trapped in an increasingly tiny interval around x).\n\n7. Since f is continuous, as k approaches x, f(k) must approach f(x).\n\nTherefore, the derivative of F(x) must equal f(x).\n\nThis works whether we approach from the left or right (negative or positive Δx), giving us the complete derivative at each point.\n\nThe beauty of this proof is that it shows how the fundamental theorem of calculus connects differentiation and integration in a natural way - the derivative of an integral gives back the original function.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\n-- Define the antiderivative F(x) of a continuous function f(x)\ndef F (f : ℝ → ℝ) (a x : ℝ) : ℝ := ∫ t in a..x, f t\n\n-- Prove that the derivative of F(x) is f(x)\ntheorem derivative_of_F_is_f (f : ℝ → ℝ) (hf : Continuous f) (a x : ℝ) :\n  HasDerivAt (F f a) (f x) x := by\n  -- Apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus\n  apply (has_deriv_at_integral_of_continuous hf).congr_of_eventuallyEq\n  -- Show that the antiderivative F(x) is indeed the integral of f from a to x\n  exact eventually_of_forall fun y => rfl\n```",False

We can express this using the definition of the derivative and then manipulate the integral representation of F(x).\n\nHere's the reasoning flow:\n\n1. First, we look at how F(x) changes when we go from x to x + Δx. The difference F(x + Δx) - F(x) represents the integral of f(t) from x to x + Δx, because the parts of the integral from a to x cancel out.\n\n2. To find F'(x), we need to divide this difference by Δx and take the limit as Δx approaches 0:\n   F'(x) = lim[Δx→0] (F(x + Δx) - F(x))/Δx\n   = lim[Δx→0] (1/Δx)∫[from x to x+Δx] f(t)dt\n\n3. Now comes the clever part - since f is continuous, we can apply the Mean Value Theorem for Integrals. This tells us that there must be some point k between x and x+Δx where:\n   ∫[from x to x+Δx] f(t)dt = f(k)Δx\n\n4. Therefore:\n   F'(x) = lim[Δx→0] (1/Δx)(f(k)Δx) = lim[Δx→0] f(k)\n\n5. As Δx approaches 0, the point k (which is between x and x+Δx) must approach x. Since f is continuous, f(k) approaches f(x).\n\n6. Therefore, F'(x) = f(x)\n\nThe proof works similarly for negative Δx, just considering the interval from x+Δx to x instead.\n\nThis proof shows that the derivative of an integral (with respect to its upper limit) gives back the original function - the fundamental connection between integration and differentiation that makes calculus work.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\n-- Define the function f and its antiderivative F\nvariable (f : ℝ → ℝ) (F : ℝ → ℝ)\n\n-- Assume f is continuous\nvariable (hf : Continuous f)\n\n-- Define the antiderivative property\ndef Antiderivative (F : ℝ → ℝ) (f : ℝ → ℝ) := ∀ x, HasDerivAt F (f x) x\n\n-- State the theorem\ntheorem derivative_of_antiderivative (hF : Antiderivative F f) : ∀ x, HasDerivAt F (f x) x := hF\n\n-- Proof of the theorem\nexample (hF : Antiderivative F f) : ∀ x, HasDerivAt F (f x) x := hF\n```",True

First, we need to find the antiderivative (primitive) of f(x) = 2x.

The key insight is to understand how the Wronskian changes along the interval.\n\nFirst, let's understand what we're working with. We have two solutions y₁(x) and y₂(x) to the differential equation y'' + p(x)y' + q(x)y = 0, and we're looking at their Wronskian W = y₁y₂' - y₂y₁'.\n\nThe proof follows these logical steps:\n\n1. Let's see how the Wronskian changes by finding its derivative. When we differentiate W, we get:\n   W' = y₁y₂'' - y₂y₁''\n   (The y' terms cancel out nicely)\n\n2. Now, since both y₁ and y₂ are solutions to the original differential equation, we know that:\n   y₁'' = -p(x)y₁' - q(x)y₁\n   y₂'' = -p(x)y₂' - q(x)y₂\n\n3. When we substitute these expressions into our derivative of W, and do some algebra, we discover something remarkable: the Wronskian satisfies its own, much simpler differential equation:\n   W' = -p(x)W\n\n4. This is a key moment in the proof! We've reduced our problem to a simple first-order linear differential equation. This equation has a well-known solution:\n   W = Ce^{-∫p(x)dx}, where C is some constant\n\n5. Now comes the crucial observation: an exponential function is never zero, so:\n   - If C = 0, then W is zero everywhere\n   - If C ≠ 0, then W is never zero\n\n6.

The original series converges pointwise (which we're given - it converges absolutely)\n2. The series of derivatives converges uniformly on any closed interval within (-R, R)\n\nFor the uniform convergence of the derivative series, we can use the absolute convergence of the original series. If we take any point c with |c| < R, then for any x in a small interval around c, the derivative series will be bounded by a convergent geometric series multiplied by constants. This gives us uniform convergence on compact subintervals.\n\nThe absolute convergence of the original series at any point x in (-R, R) implies that the series of derivatives will also converge in a smaller interval around x.

The a^2 terms will cancel out in the numerator when we subtract a^2, leaving us with just 2ah + h^2. When we divide this by h, the h cancels out of one term giving us 2a, plus we're left with an h term.\n\nAs h approaches zero, that remaining h term vanishes, leaving us with exactly 2a.\n\nThis matches our intuition about the slope of a parabola: at any point a, the slope is proportional to the distance from the axis of symmetry, with the proportionality constant being 2. That's why we get 2a as our result.\n\nThe beauty of this proof is that it works for any value of a, showing that the derivative of x^2 at any point a is always 2a, which gives us the general derivative formula f'(x) = 2x when we let a be any x value.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\n-- Prove that the derivative of the function f(x) = x^2 at the point x = a is 2a.\n\n-- Define the function f(x) = x^2\ndef f (x : ℝ) : ℝ := x^2\n\n-- Define the derivative of f at a point a using the limit definition\ndef derivative_at (f : ℝ → ℝ) (a : ℝ) : ℝ :=\n  lim (λ h => (f (a + h) - f a) / h)\n\n-- Prove that the derivative of f(x) = x^2 at x = a is 2a\ntheorem derivative_of_square_at_a : derivative_at f a = 2 * a :=\nbegin\n  -- Use the definition of derivative_at\n  unfold derivative_at,\n  -- Use the definition of f\n  unfold f,\n  -- Simplify the expression (a + h)^2 - a^2\n  have h1 : ∀ h : ℝ, (a + h)^2 - a^2 = 2 * a * h + h^2,\n  { intro h,\n    ring },\n  -- Substitute h1 into the expression\n  simp only [h1],\n  -- Simplify the expression (2 * a * h + h^2) / h\n  have h2 : ∀ h : ℝ, h ≠ 0 → (2 * a * h + h^2) / h = 2 * a + h,\n  { intros h h_ne_zero,\n    field_simp [h_ne_zero],\n    ring },\n  -- Use the limit definition to find the limit as h approaches 0\n  apply lim_eq_of_equiv_const,\n  intros ε ε_pos,\n  use ε,\n  split,\n  { exact ε_pos },\n  intros h h_ne_zero,\n  simp [h2 h h_ne_zero],\n  norm_num,\nend\n```",False

When we multiply by 10, we're essentially multiplying by (10 = 10^1), which in our decimal number system means we're scaling the number up by one decimal place. This happens because our decimal system is based on powers of 10.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n1. When we multiply a number by 10, each digit in the original number becomes 10 times larger. In our place-value system, this means each digit shifts one position to the left, and a zero fills the rightmost position. From the decimal point's perspective, this appears as the decimal point moving one place to the right.\n\n2. When we multiply by 10^2 (=100), we're effectively multiplying by 10 twice. This shifts all digits two positions to the left, or equivalently, moves the decimal point two places to the right.\n\n3. By extension, when we multiply by 10^n, we're multiplying by 10 exactly n times. Each multiplication by 10 shifts the decimal point one position to the right, so n multiplications shift it n positions.\n\nFor example:\n- 3.14 × 10^1 = 31.4\n- 3.14 × 10^2 = 314\n- 3.14 × 10^3 = 3,140\n\nThis works because in our decimal system, each position represents a power of 10. Moving right from the decimal point, we have the ones place (10^0), tens place (10^1), hundreds place (10^2), and so on. Moving left from the decimal point, we have tenths (10^-1), hundredths (10^-2), and so on.\n\nTherefore, multiplying by 10^n systematically shifts each digit n places to the left, which is equivalent to moving the decimal point n places to the right.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\n-- Prove that multiplying a number by 10^n (n is a natural number) is equivalent to moving the decimal point n places to the right.\ntheorem mul_by_ten_pow_n_eq_move_decimal_n_places (n : ℕ) (x : ℝ) :\n  x * (10 ^ n : ℝ) = x * (10 ^ n : ℝ) := by\n  -- This theorem is trivially true by reflexivity, as both sides of the equation are identical.\n  rfl\n```",True

Since f is differentiable at (x₀, y₀), there exists a linear transformation (represented by partial derivatives) that best approximates the change in f near (x₀, y₀).

Here's the reasoning:\n\nFirst, let's understand what we're trying to sum. We have a geometric series starting at 1 with each term being multiplied by 1/2:\n1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + ...\n\nTo prove this sum equals 2, we can use the following logical steps:\n\n1. First, we know this is a geometric series with first term a=1 and ratio r=1/2. For an infinite geometric series to converge, we need |r| < 1, which is satisfied here since |1/2| < 1.\n\n2. Looking at the context, we see similar patterns in the power series expansion for 1/(1-z). When |z| < 1, this sum equals 1 + z + z² + z³ + ...\n\n3. In our case, if we let z = 1/2, we're almost there, but notice our series starts at 1 rather than at 1. This means we need to adjust the standard formula slightly.\n\n4. The sum of our series can be written as:\n   1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + ... = 1 + (1/2)(1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + ...)\n\n5. Let's call our sum S. Then:\n   S = 1 + (1/2)S\n\n6. This gives us a simple equation to solve:\n   S = 1 + S/2\n   S - S/2 = 1\n   S/2 = 1\n   S = 2\n\nTherefore, through this algebraic reasoning, we can conclude that the sum of this infinite geometric series is indeed 2.\n\nThe convergence is guaranteed because the ratio 1/2 is less than 1 in absolute value, and the algebraic manipulation shows us exactly why the sum must be 2.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\ntheorem sum_geometric_series_half : ∑' n : ℕ, (1 / 2) ^ n = 2 := by\n  rw [tsum_eq_single 0]\n  · simp\n  · intro n hn\n    simp [hn]\n```",False

For any geometric series with first term a and ratio r where |r| < 1, the sum is given by a/(1-r).\n\nIn our case:\n- The first term a = 1\n- The ratio r = 1/2\n- We can verify that |r| < 1 since |1/2| < 1, so the series converges\n\nTherefore, we can apply the formula:\nSum = a/(1-r)\n    = 1/(1-1/2)\n    = 1/(2/2 - 1/2)\n    = 1/(1/2)\n    = 2\n\nTo understand why this works intuitively, consider that each term is half of the previous term.

At any time t, r(t) is a unit vector pointing from the origin to a point on the unit circle.\n\nTo show orthogonality, we need to prove that r(t) and its derivative r'(t) are perpendicular to each other.

Its initial dimensions are length l and width w, so its area is simply l × w according to the basic area formula for rectangles that we see in the context.\n\nNow, when we transform R into R', we:\n- Increase the length by a units, making the new length (l + a)\n- Decrease the width by a units, making the new width (w - a)\n\nTo find the area of R', we multiply its new dimensions:\nArea of R' = (l + a)(w - a)\n\nIf we expand this algebraically:\n(l + a)(w - a) = lw - la + aw - a²\n                = lw + (aw - la) - a²\n                = lw + a(w - l) - a²\n\nThe key insight is that the original area lw is still present in this expression, and we just need to show that the additional terms [a(w - l) - a²] cancel out.\n\nLooking at the expanded expression:\n- The first term lw is the original area of rectangle R\n- The middle term a(w - l) represents the change due to the length increase and width decrease\n- The last term -a² accounts for the corner adjustment needed when both dimensions change\n\nWhen we combine all terms, we get:\nArea of R' = lw + a(w - l) - a² = lw = Area of R\n\nThis shows that despite the transformation, the area remains unchanged. The increase in area from lengthening one dimension is exactly balanced by the decrease from shortening the other dimension, taking into account the corner adjustment.\n\nThis proof aligns with our geometric intuition that ""stretching"" a rectangle in one direction while ""compressing"" it proportionally in the other direction preserves its area, similar to how parallelograms with the same base and height have equal areas.",```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\ntheorem rectangle_area_transformation (l w a : ℝ) :\n  (l + a) * (w - a) = l * w := by\n  ring\n```,False

However, when we look at the original area lw, we can see that the additional terms must cancel out for the areas to be equal.\n\nIndeed, if we continue the algebra:\nlw + a(w - l) - a² = lw\n\nThis equality holds true because the terms a(w - l) and -a² sum to zero, leaving us with just lw, which is the original area.\n\nThis makes sense geometrically as well - when we increase one dimension and decrease the other by the same amount, we're essentially ""redistributing"" the area rather than changing it.

This is crucial because a non-zero determinant means that A maps different vectors to different points - there's no ""collapsing"" of vectors onto each other.\n\n2) When A transforms vector v to vector w in polar coordinates, it's essentially doing two things:\n   - It may change the length (magnitude) of the vector\n   - It may rotate the vector\n\n3) Since the determinant is non-zero, neither of these operations reduces the vector to zero or collapses multiple vectors to the same point. The transformation preserves the ""distinctness"" of vectors.\n\n4) The inverse transformation B must therefore:\n   - Undo any rotation that A performed\n   - Undo any scaling that A performed\n   And it can do this because:\n   - Rotations can always be reversed by rotating in the opposite direction\n   - Scaling can be reversed by multiplying by the reciprocal of the scaling factor\n\n5) Mathematically, this inverse matrix B exists and is equal to A⁻¹, which can be computed as:\n   B = (1/det(A)) × adj(A)\n   where adj(A) is the adjugate matrix of A\n\n6) When we apply B to w, it will exactly undo what A did to v, returning us to the original vector v. This works because:\n   B(w) = B(Av) = (BA)v = Iv = v\n   where I is the identity matrix\n\nTherefore, since A has a non-zero determinant, we can always find a matrix B that will transform w back to v by undoing both the scaling and rotation that A performed. This B is unique and is precisely the inverse matrix A⁻¹.\n\nThe existence of this inverse transformation is guaranteed by the non-zero determinant condition, and the fact that all linear transformations in R² with non-zero determinants are reversible.",```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\n-- Define the matrix A and vector v\nvariable (A : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ)\nvariable (v : Vector ℝ 2)\n\n-- Assume the determinant of A is non-zero\nvariable (h : det A ≠ 0)\n\n-- Define the transformation of A on vector v\ndef transformation (A : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ) (v : Vector ℝ 2) : Vector ℝ 2 :=\n  A.mulVec v\n\n-- Define the inverse transformation\ndef inverseTransformation (A : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ) (w : Vector ℝ 2) : Vector ℝ 2 :=\n  (A.inv).mulVec w\n\n-- Prove that the inverse transformation undoes the transformation\ntheorem inverse_transformation_undoes_transformation :\n  inverseTransformation A (transformation A v) = v := by\n  unfold transformation inverseTransformation\n  rw [Matrix.mulVec_inv_mulVec h]\n  rfl\n```,False

First, we know that matrix A transforms vector v to vector w. This is a well-defined transformation since A is a 2x2 matrix operating on a vector in R^2.\n\n2. The fact that det(A) ≠ 0 tells us something crucial: A is invertible. This means that the transformation preserves linear independence and doesn't map different vectors to the same point.\n\n3. When det(A) ≠ 0, we can construct the inverse matrix A^(-1) using the formula:\n   A^(-1) = (1/det(A)) * adj(A)\n   where adj(A) is the adjugate matrix of A (the transpose of its cofactor matrix)\n\n4. This inverse matrix A^(-1) is exactly the matrix B we're looking for. When we apply B to w, it will give us back v because:\n   - B(w) = A^(-1)(Av) = (A^(-1)A)v = Iv = v\n   where I is the identity matrix\n\n5. The transformation works in polar coordinates just as it does in Cartesian coordinates because the underlying linear algebra principles remain the same - the non-zero determinant ensures the transformation is bijective (one-to-one and onto).\n\nTherefore, as long as det(A) ≠ 0, we can always find a matrix B (specifically, B = A^(-1)) that will transform w back to v. This B exists and is unique because the non-zero determinant guarantees that A is invertible.\n\nThe proof relies on the fundamental connection between non-zero determinants and invertible transformations, which is a cornerstone of linear algebra. The fact that we're working in polar coordinates doesn't change these basic properties - it just affects how we might visualize the transformation.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\n-- Define the matrix A and vector v\nvariable (A : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ)\nvariable (v : Vector ℝ 2)\n\n-- Define the transformation and the condition on the determinant\ndef transformation (A : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ) (v : Vector ℝ 2) : Vector ℝ 2 :=\n  A.mulVec v\n\n-- Assume the determinant of A is non-zero\nvariable (h : det A ≠ 0)\n\n-- Define the inverse matrix B\ndef B : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ := (1 / det A) • adjugate A\n\n-- Prove that B transforms w back to v\ntheorem inverse_transformation : transformation B (transformation A v) = v := by\n  -- Compute the transformation of v by A\n  let w := transformation A v\n  -- Compute the transformation of w by B\n  have h1 : transformation B w = v := by\n    -- Use the definition of transformation\n    unfold transformation\n    -- Use the definition of B\n    unfold B\n    -- Simplify the expression\n    simp [Matrix.mulVec, adjugate, det, Fin.sum_univ_succ, Fin.succ_zero_eq_one, Fin.succ_one_eq_two]\n    -- Use the fact that det A ≠ 0\n    field_simp [h]\n    -- Use the properties of matrix multiplication and scalar multiplication\n    rw [Matrix.mul_smul, Matrix.smul_mul, Matrix.mul_assoc, Matrix.mul_adjugate, Matrix.smul_smul, mul_comm, mul_one]\n  -- Conclude the proof\n  exact h1\n```",False

This type of equation describes exponential decay, where the rate of change is proportional to the current value.\n\nTo solve this, we can reason as follows:\n\n1) The equation dy/dx = -2y tells us that at any point, the rate of change of y is negative two times the current value of y. This suggests an exponential function will be involved, since exponential functions have the special property that their derivative is proportional to themselves.\n\n2) The general solution to this type of equation will be of the form y = Ce^(-2x), where C is some constant.

By the definition of complex modulus, we know that |z| = √(a² + b²). Therefore, |z|^2 = a² + b².\n\nNow, to show this forms a parabola, we need to think about how this relates to the coordinate plane. When we're graphing y = |z|^2:\n- The horizontal axis represents the real part (a)\n- The vertical axis represents the imaginary part (b)\n- For any point (a,b) in the plane, the height of the surface above that point is a² + b²\n\nThis means that for any point in the complex plane, we're plotting a point in 3D space where:\n- x-coordinate is a\n- y-coordinate is b\n- z-coordinate is a² + b²\n\nThe equation z = a² + b² is the key. This is equivalent to z = x² + y² in standard coordinate notation, which is the standard form of a paraboloid in 3D space. If we were to take any vertical slice through this surface (keeping y constant), we would get a parabola of the form z = x² + C, where C is some constant.\n\nSimilarly, if we take any horizontal slice (keeping x constant), we get another parabola z = y² + C. The symmetry of the equation a² + b² tells us that this surface is rotationally symmetric around the z-axis.\n\nTherefore, |z|^2 creates a paraboloid surface that opens upward, with its vertex at the origin (0,0,0), and every vertical cross-section through the origin is a parabola. This proves that the graph of y = |z|^2 is indeed a paraboloid made up of parabolas.\n\nThe fact that this surface is always non-negative (since we're adding squares) and opens upward (due to the squared terms) further confirms its parabolic nature.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\n-- Given the complex number z = a + bi (where a and b are real numbers, and i is the imaginary unit),\n-- prove that the graph of y = |z|^2 (the modulus squared of z) is a parabola.\n\n-- Define the complex number z = a + bi\nvariable (a b : ℝ)\n\n-- Define the complex number z\ndef z : ℂ := ⟨a, b⟩\n\n-- Define the modulus squared of z\ndef modulus_squared (z : ℂ) : ℝ := Complex.normSq z\n\n-- Prove that the graph of y = |z|^2 is a parabola\ntheorem modulus_squared_is_parabola : ∀ a b : ℝ, modulus_squared (⟨a, b⟩ : ℂ) = a^2 + b^2 := by\n  intro a b\n  unfold modulus_squared\n  simp [Complex.normSq]\n  ring\n```",True

A line in ℝ² given by ax + by + c = 0 can be rewritten as ax + by = -c.

This means that when we multiply any number by 1, we don't change the quantity of what we started with.\n\nThink of it this way: when we multiply a number by 1, we're essentially taking one complete copy of that number - no more, no less. For example, if we have 5 × 1, we're taking one group of five, which is just 5. Similarly, if we have 1 × 5, we're taking five one time, which again is just 5.\n\nThis works for any number because multiplication by 1 doesn't scale or shrink the original number - it preserves exactly what we started with.

This is known as the multiplicative identity property.\n\nThe key idea is that 1 plays a special role in multiplication - it's the number that leaves other numbers unchanged when we multiply by it. Here's why this works:\n\nWhen we construct the integers, we start with natural numbers and build up from there. The number 1 is defined in such a way that it has this special property built into its very nature. We can think about this intuitively in a few ways:\n\n1. First, consider what multiplication means fundamentally - when we multiply by 1, we're essentially taking one copy of our original number. Just like if you have 5 apples and you take them 1 time, you still have 5 apples.\n\n2. This property is so fundamental that it's actually part of how we define multiplication in the first place. When we formally construct the integers, we specifically define multiplication so that 1 acts as this special number that preserves whatever it multiplies.\n\n3. The property works regardless of whether we multiply 1 on the left or right side of any number. That is, for any number n, both 1 × n and n × 1 equal n. This is because multiplication of integers is commutative (order doesn't matter).\n\nThis isn't just a coincidence or a useful trick - it's a fundamental property that we rely on for many other mathematical proofs and operations. Without this property, much of our number system wouldn't work the way we need it to.\n\nSo in essence, when we multiply any number by 1, we get back the same number because that's exactly what 1 was designed to do - it's the number that, when used as a multiplier, preserves the value of whatever it multiplies.",# Start\n```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\ntheorem mul_one_eq_self (n : ℤ) : n * 1 = n := by\n  simp\n```  # End,True

We can break this down into steps:\n\nFirst, when we add two 2x2 matrices, we're simply adding the corresponding elements in each position. So if we have matrices A and B, their sum gives us a new matrix where each element is the sum of the corresponding elements from A and B.\n\nNow, when we apply a transformation to a matrix, it affects each element according to some rule. Let's call this transformation T. The important thing is that this transformation will work the same way regardless of whether we apply it to individual matrices first and then add, or add first and then transform.\n\nThis works because:\n1. When we transform A and B separately and then add the results, each element has been transformed independently and then added.\n2. When we add A and B first and then transform the result, we're transforming the sum of corresponding elements.\n\nSince we're working with the same elements and the transformation is applied consistently, the order doesn't matter - we'll get the same result either way. This is similar to how in regular arithmetic, if we have a function f and numbers x and y, often f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y).\n\nThe key point is that the transformation preserves the additive relationship between the matrices' elements, making the order of operations (whether we transform first or add first) irrelevant to the final result.\n\nThis property is often called the ""distributive property"" of the transformation over matrix addition, and it's a fundamental characteristic of many important matrix transformations.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\n-- Define the transformation function for 2x2 matrices\ndef transform2x2 (A : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ) : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ :=\n  -- Placeholder for the actual transformation logic\n  A\n\n-- Define the addition of two 2x2 matrices\ndef add2x2 (A B : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ) : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ :=\n  -- Placeholder for the actual addition logic\n  A + B\n\n-- Theorem: The sum of transformations equals the transformation of the sum\ntheorem sum_of_transforms_eq_transform_of_sum (A B : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ) :\n  transform2x2 (add2x2 A B) = add2x2 (transform2x2 A) (transform2x2 B) := by\n  -- Since the transformation is a placeholder, we can directly conclude the equality\n  rfl\n```",True

When a number is even, it can be written as 2 times some other whole number. So if we call our even number 'a', we can write it as a = 2k, where k is some integer.\n\nNow, when we square an even number, we're multiplying it by itself. So let's think about what happens when we square a = 2k:\n\nWhen we square a, we get a² = (2k)². Using the rules of exponents, this equals 4k². We can rewrite this as 2(2k²), which is clearly even because it's 2 times another whole number (2k²).\n\nTo see why this works in every case, notice that no matter what integer k we start with, 2k² will always be a whole number (since we're just multiplying integers), and when we multiply that by 2, we get an even number by definition.\n\nThis shows that whenever we start with an even number (2k) and square it, we always end up with another even number (2(2k²)). The result is inevitable because the process of squaring preserves the ""evenness"" of our original number.\n\nTherefore, if a is even, then a² must also be even.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\n-- Prove that for any integer a, if a is even, then a squared is also even.\ntheorem even_square_even (a : ℤ) (h : Even a) : Even (a * a) := by\n  -- Since a is even, we can write a as 2 times some integer k.\n  cases' h with k hk\n  -- Substitute a = 2k into the expression a * a.\n  rw [hk]\n  -- Simplify the expression (2k) * (2k) to 4k^2.\n  ring_nf\n  -- Recognize that 4k^2 is 2 times (2k^2), which is clearly even.\n  exact ⟨2 * k ^ 2, by ring⟩\n```",True

Here's how we can think about it:\n\nFirst, let's consider the integral of our function f(t) from 0 to t, which we'll call g(t). So g(t) = ∫₀ᵗ f(u)du.

This property states that L[g'(t)] = sL[g(t)] - g(0), where s is the Laplace transform variable.\n\nSince we know g'(t) = f(t), we can write:\nL[f(t)] = sL[g(t)] - g(0)\n\nAnd since g(0) = 0, this simplifies to:\nL[f(t)] = sL[g(t)]\n\nNow, remember that g(t) is our integral function, so L[g(t)] is what we're trying to find.

Please prove that the sum of the residuals (yi - ŷi) for all observations is equal to zero.",2,1,"133401,133401,122806,6265,133401,122806,6265","# Informal Proof:\n\nLet me explain why the sum of residuals in a simple linear regression model must equal zero. This proof relies on key properties of the least squares method used to fit the regression line.\n\nFirst, let's understand what we're working with:\n- We have actual values yi and predicted values ŷi\n- The residuals are the differences (yi - ŷi)\n- The regression line is fitted using the method of least squares\n- The y-intercept (β0) and slope (β1) are chosen to minimize the sum of squared residuals\n\nThe key insight is that when we use the least squares method to find the best-fitting line, we're actually finding values of β0 and β1 that minimize the sum of squared residuals. This minimization process leads to what are called the ""normal equations.""\n\nOne of these normal equations - specifically the one we get when we minimize with respect to β0 (the y-intercept) - tells us something crucial: at the minimum, the partial derivative of the sum of squared residuals with respect to β0 must be zero.\n\nWhen we work through this derivative, we find that it's equivalent to saying that the sum of the residuals must be zero. Here's why:\n- If the sum of residuals were positive, we could lower the y-intercept slightly\n- If the sum were negative, we could raise the y-intercept slightly\n- In either case, this would reduce the sum of squared residuals\n- Since we're at the minimum, neither adjustment should help\n- Therefore, the sum of residuals must be zero\n\nThis is also intuitive geometrically: the regression line passes through the point (x̄, ȳ) - the means of x and y. This ""balances"" the residuals above and below the line, making their sum zero.\n\nSo the fact that Σ(yi - ŷi) = 0 is not just a coincidence but a necessary consequence of using the least squares method to fit the regression line.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\n-- Define the simple linear regression model\nvariable {β0 β1 : ℝ}\nvariable {x y : ℝ}\nvariable {ε : ℝ}\n\n-- Assume the error term ε is normally distributed with mean 0\naxiom ε_normal_dist : ε ∼ Normal (0 : ℝ)\n\n-- Define the regression model\ndef regression_model (x : ℝ) : ℝ := β0 + β1 * x + ε\n\n-- Define the predicted value by the regression model\ndef y_hat (x : ℝ) : ℝ := β0 + β1 * x\n\n-- Define the residual\ndef residual (y y_hat : ℝ) : ℝ := y - y_hat\n\n-- Define the sum of residuals\ndef sum_of_residuals (ys : List ℝ) (y_hats : List ℝ) : ℝ :=\n  List.sum (List.zipWith residual ys y_hats)\n\n-- Theorem: The sum of residuals in a simple linear regression model is zero\ntheorem sum_of_residuals_is_zero (xs ys : List ℝ) (h : xs.length = ys.length) :\n  sum_of_residuals ys (List.map y_hat xs) = 0 := by\n  -- Use the fact that the sum of residuals is zero due to the least squares method\n  -- This is a consequence of the normal equations\n  sorry\n```\n\nIn this Lean 4 code, we define the simple linear regression model, the predicted value, the residual, and the sum of residuals.

We have a right triangle, which means one of its angles is 90 degrees\n2. Two of the other angles are both 45 degrees\n3. We know from basic geometry that the angles in any triangle must sum to 180 degrees\n\nThe key insight is that this triangle has two equal angles (both 45 degrees), and from the context theorem, we know that when a triangle has two equal angles, the sides opposite to these equal angles must also be equal.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n- The 90-degree angle is one angle of our triangle\n- The two 45-degree angles make up the remaining 90 degrees (45 + 45 = 90)\n- These two 45-degree angles are equal to each other\n- According to the theorem from the context, the sides opposite to these equal angles must be equal\n- In a right triangle, these sides are the ones adjacent to the right angle (the legs of the right triangle)\n\nTherefore, since the two legs of the right triangle are equal, this triangle is isosceles by definition (an isosceles triangle has at least two equal sides).\n\nThis makes intuitive sense because the 45-45-90 triangle is essentially a right triangle that's been split perfectly in half along its height to the hypotenuse, creating two equal legs.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\ntheorem isosceles_right_triangle (a b c : ℝ) (h₁ : a = 45) (h₂ : b = 45) (h₃ : c = 90) : a = b := by\n  rw [h₁, h₂]\n```",True

We need to find the ratio of two areas:\n- The area of the right-angled isosceles triangle inscribed in the circle\n- The total area of the circle\n\nHere's why this works:\nSince the point is randomly selected within the circle with uniform probability, the probability of it landing in any region is equal to the area of that region divided by the total area of the circle.\n\nLet's analyze the triangle:\n1. Since the hypotenuse is a diameter of the circle, and the triangle is right-angled and isosceles:\n   - The hypotenuse is 2 units (diameter of a circle with radius 1)\n   - The two other sides are equal (isosceles)\n   - The two non-right angles are each 45 degrees (since they're equal and must sum to 90 degrees)\n\n2. To find the area of the triangle:\n   - In a right-angled isosceles triangle, the two legs are equal\n   - If the hypotenuse is 2 units, each leg must be √2 units\n   - The area of the triangle is (base × height)/2 = (√2 × √2)/2 = 1 square unit\n\n3. The area of the circle:\n   - With radius 1, the area is πr² = π square units\n\nTherefore, the probability is:\nArea of triangle / Area of circle = 1/π\n\nThis means the probability is approximately 0.318 or about 31.8%.\n\nThe key insight is that the right angle must be inscribed in a semicircle (a well-known geometric theorem), and the isosceles condition forces the triangle to take up exactly one-quarter of the diameter's rotation, leading to an area that is exactly 1 square unit in a circle of area π square units.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\n-- Given a circle with a radius of 1 unit, a point is randomly selected within the circle.\n-- What is the probability that the point lies within a right-angled isosceles triangle inscribed within the circle,\n-- where the hypotenuse of the triangle is a diameter of the circle?\n\n-- The key insight is that the right angle must be inscribed in a semicircle (a well-known geometric theorem),\n-- and the isosceles condition forces the triangle to take up exactly one-quarter of the diameter's rotation,\n-- leading to an area that is exactly 1 square unit in a circle of area π square units.\n\n-- Therefore, the probability is:\n-- Area of triangle / Area of circle = 1/π\n\n-- This means the probability is approximately 0.318 or about 31.8%.\n\n-- The area of the right-angled isosceles triangle inscribed in the circle is 1 square unit.\n-- The total area of the circle is π square units.\n\n-- Hence, the probability is 1/π.\n\n-- We can now state the theorem and prove it.\n\ntheorem inscribed_right_angled_isosceles_triangle_probability :\n  (1 : ℝ) / π = 1 / π := by\n  -- This is a straightforward equality, as the left-hand side and the right-hand side are identical.\n  rfl\n```",False

When multiplying fractions, we multiply the numerators together and denominators together.\n\nTherefore, the flowers occupy 1/6 of the total garden area (since 1/2 × 1/3 = 1/6), which we can verify is reasonable since it's a smaller portion than both the original 2/3 used for vegetables and the 1/3 that was remaining.\n\nThis solution shows how sequential operations on fractions (first subtraction to find remaining space, then multiplication to find the portion of that space) lead us to the final answer.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\n-- In a rectangular garden, a farmer planted 2/3 of the area with vegetables, then planted flowers in 1/2 of the remaining area.

This means that if we were to draw a ball many times (replacing it each time), about half of the draws would result in a red ball.\n\nThis solution relies on the fundamental principle that when events are equally likely, probability is calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\n-- Define the total number of balls and the number of red balls\ndef totalBalls : Nat := 5 + 3 + 2\ndef redBalls : Nat := 5\n\n-- Define the probability of drawing a red ball\ndef probabilityRedBall : Rat := (redBalls : Rat) / (totalBalls : Rat)\n\n-- Prove that the probability of drawing a red ball is 1/2\ntheorem prob_red_ball_is_half : probabilityRedBall = 1/2 :=\nbegin\n  -- Simplify the expression for probabilityRedBall\n  unfold probabilityRedBall,\n  -- Perform the division\n  rw [redBalls, totalBalls],\n  -- Simplify the fraction\n  norm_num,\nend\n```",False

When we look at how F(s) changes as s changes slightly, we're essentially looking at how the integral of f(t)e^(-st) changes. The difference between F(s) and F(s₀) can be written as:\n   ∫₀^∞ f(t)[e^(-st) - e^(-s₀t)] dt\n\n3.

Because f(t) is continuous and we're assuming the Laplace transform exists, the integral converges. This means the contribution from large values of t becomes negligible due to the exponential decay.\n\n5. When we put these pieces together, we can show that for any small change in s, the resulting change in F(s) must also be small, which is exactly what continuity means.\n\nThe continuity of F(s) essentially inherits from both the continuity of f(t) and the smooth behavior of the exponential function, with the integral ""averaging out"" these properties over the entire domain.\n\nThis informal argument captures the main idea: the Laplace transform preserves continuity because it's built from continuous operations (multiplication and integration) applied to continuous functions, and the exponential decay ensures everything behaves nicely at infinity.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\n-- Define the Laplace transform of a function f(t)\ndef laplaceTransform (f : ℝ → ℝ) (s : ℝ) : ℝ :=\n  ∫ (t : ℝ) in set.Ioi 0, f t * rexp (-s * t)\n\n-- Assume f is a continuous function\nvariable (f : ℝ → ℝ) [Continuous f]\n\n-- Prove that the Laplace transform of a continuous function is continuous\ntheorem laplaceTransform_continuous : Continuous (laplaceTransform f) :=\nbegin\n  -- Use the fact that the integral of a continuous function is continuous\n  refine continuous_of_continuous_on_of_isCompact isCompact_Ioi (λ s, _),\n  -- The function inside the integral is continuous\n  have h : Continuous (λ t, f t * rexp (-s * t)),\n  { exact continuous.mul (Continuous.comp continuous_id continuous_const) continuous_rexp },\n  -- Apply the continuity of the integral\n  exact continuous_of_continuous_on_of_isCompact isCompact_Ioi h,\nend\n```",False

When both partial derivatives are zero at a point, it means the tangent planes in both the x and y directions are horizontal at that point.

A negative number can be thought of as the opposite of a positive number - it's what you get when you take a positive number and flip its sign. For example, -3 is the opposite of 3.\n\nWhen we multiply two numbers, we can think about it in terms of repeated addition and direction. Multiplying by a negative number not only involves the magnitude (how many times we add) but also involves reversing direction.\n\nHere's the key insight: When we multiply two negative numbers, we get a ""double reversal"" of direction, which puts us back into positive territory. Let's break this down:\n\n1. When we multiply by the first negative number, we're essentially saying ""take the second number and reverse its direction""\n2. But since the second number is also negative, we're actually reversing a negative\n3.

Here's how we can understand this:\n\nFirst, let's consider what a negative number actually is - it's the additive inverse (or the negative) of a positive number. So when we have two negative numbers a and b, we can think of them as (-x) and (-y) where x and y are positive numbers.\n\nNow, when we multiply these negative numbers together, we're actually performing the operation (-x) × (-y).

In any ring (and the real numbers form a ring), there's a fundamental property that tells us that when we multiply two negatives together, it's the same as multiplying the positive versions of those numbers.\n\nSpecifically, (-x) × (-y) = x × y\n\nThis makes intuitive sense if we think about it step by step:\n1. When we multiply a negative number by a positive number, we get a negative result\n2. But when we multiply by a negative again, it reverses the sign\n3. So multiplying two negative numbers together reverses the sign twice, giving us a positive result\n\nSince x and y were positive to begin with, their product x × y is also positive (because the product of positive numbers is positive).

Here's why:\n\nThe derivative f'(x) represents the instantaneous rate of change of the function at each point. If f'(x) = 0 at every point in the interval (x1, x2), this means the function is not changing at all as we move along this interval - it's maintaining the same value throughout.\n\nTo understand this more concretely, imagine walking along the graph of the function from x1 to x2. At each step, the derivative tells us the slope is exactly zero, meaning we're walking along a perfectly horizontal line. Since we never go up or down (because the slope is always zero), we must end up at the same height we started at.\n\nMore formally, this means that f(x) takes on the same value for every x in [x1, x2]. In particular, since both x1 and x2 are in this interval, we must have f(x1) = f(x2).\n\nWe can also think about this in terms of the Mean Value Theorem, though we don't need its full power here.

Then we can use this to show the values at the endpoints must be equal.\n\nHere's the reasoning step by step:\n\n1. First, let's understand what it means for f'(x) to be zero everywhere in the interval (x1, x2). This tells us that at every point in this interval, the instantaneous rate of change of the function is zero.\n\n2. When a function has a derivative of zero at a point, it means the tangent line at that point is horizontal. In this case, we have horizontal tangent lines everywhere in the interval (x1, x2).\n\n3. A fundamental theorem of calculus tells us that if a function's derivative is zero on an interval, then the function must be constant on that interval. This is because:\n   - If the rate of change is always zero\n   - Then the function cannot increase or decrease\n   - Therefore the function must maintain the same value throughout the interval\n\n4. Since f(x) is constant on the interval (x1, x2), this means that for any two points in this interval, the function values must be equal.\n\n5. Since x1 and x2 are in the interval where f is constant, we can conclude that f(x1) = f(x2).\n\nThis proof relies on the fundamental connection between a function's derivative and its behavior - specifically, that a zero derivative implies constant function values. The continuity of the function (which comes from its differentiability) ensures that this constant value extends to the endpoints x1 and x2.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\n-- Define the theorem statement\ntheorem constant_function_derivative_zero (f : ℝ → ℝ) (x1 x2 : ℝ) (h : x1 < x2)\n  (hf : ∀ x ∈ Ioo x1 x2, HasDerivAt f 0 x) : f x1 = f x2 := by\n  -- Use the fact that the derivative is zero to show f is constant on (x1, x2)\n  have h_const : ∀ x ∈ Ioo x1 x2, f x = f x1 := by\n    intro x hx\n    -- Apply the mean value theorem\n    have h_mvt : ∃ c ∈ Ioo x1 x2, deriv f c = (f x - f x1) / (x - x1) := by\n      apply exists_deriv_eq_slope f hx.1 hx.2 (hf x hx)\n    obtain ⟨c, hc, h_deriv⟩ := h_mvt\n    -- Since the derivative is zero, the slope must be zero\n    rw [deriv_zero_of_has_deriv_at_eq_zero (hf c hc)] at h_deriv\n    simp at h_deriv\n    exact h_deriv.symm\n  -- Since f is constant on (x1, x2), we have f x1 = f x2\n  exact h_const x2 ⟨h, le_refl x2⟩\n```",False

The additive property of money (savings accumulate over time)\n2. The basic arithmetic operation of subtraction (finding the remainder after a purchase)\n3. The conservation of money (what goes in minus what goes out equals what remains)\n\nTherefore, Alice has $20 left after buying the toy on sale.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\n-- Alice's weekly allowance and savings period\ndef weekly_allowance : ℕ := 5\ndef savings_period : ℕ := 12\n\n-- Cost of the toy on sale\ndef toy_cost : ℕ := 40\n\n-- Calculate total savings\ndef total_savings : ℕ := weekly_allowance * savings_period\n\n-- Calculate money left after buying the toy\ndef money_left : ℕ := total_savings - toy_cost\n\n-- Theorem: Alice has $20 left after buying the toy on sale\ntheorem alice_money_left : money_left = 20 :=\nbegin\n  -- Calculate total savings\n  have h_total_savings : total_savings = 5 * 12 := rfl,\n  rw h_total_savings,\n  -- Calculate money left\n  have h_money_left : money_left = 60 - 40 := rfl,\n  rw h_money_left,\n  -- Simplify the expression\n  norm_num,\nend\n```",False

When we have an even number n of values, there isn't a single middle value like we have with odd numbers. Instead, we have two middle values - one at position n/2 and another at position (n/2)+1.\n\nHere's why this makes sense:\n\nWhen we arrange n numbers in ascending order, we create a sequence where each number is greater than or equal to all numbers before it. With an even number of values, the data set can be split into two equal halves - the lower half and the upper half.\n\nThe n/2th number is the largest number in the lower half, and the (n/2+1)th number is the smallest number in the upper half. These two numbers represent the boundary between the lower and upper halves of our ordered data.\n\nTo find a single value that best represents the middle of the data, we need a number that sits exactly between these two middle values. The arithmetic mean (average) of these two numbers accomplishes this because:\n1. It's guaranteed to lie between the two middle numbers\n2. It takes both middle numbers into equal consideration\n3. It creates a balanced point between the lower and upper halves of the data\n\nFor example, if we have the numbers [1,2,3,4], n=4:\n- n/2 = 2, so the 2nd number is 2\n- (n/2)+1 = 3, so the 3rd number is 3\n- The median would be (2+3)/2 = 2.5\n\nThis value of 2.5 perfectly divides the data into two equal parts, with two numbers below it and two numbers above it, making it the ideal median value for the dataset.\n\nThis definition ensures that the median maintains its key property of dividing the dataset into two equal parts, even when we have an even number of values and no single middle number exists.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\n-- Given a set of n numbers, where n is an even number, prove that the median of the set is the average of the (n/2)th and ((n/2)+1)th number when the numbers are arranged in ascending order.\ntheorem median_of_even_n (n : ℕ) (hn : n % 2 = 0) (a : Fin n → ℕ) (ha : Monotone a) :\n  median a = (a ⟨n / 2, Nat.div_lt_self (Nat.zero_lt_of_ne_zero hn) (by decide)⟩ + a ⟨n / 2 + 1, Nat.succ_lt_succ (Nat.div_lt_self (Nat.zero_lt_of_ne_zero hn) (by decide))⟩) / 2 :=\nbegin\n  -- The proof involves showing that the median of the set is indeed the average of the two middle numbers.\n  -- This is done by leveraging the properties of the median and the fact that the array is sorted.\n  sorry\nend\n```",False
