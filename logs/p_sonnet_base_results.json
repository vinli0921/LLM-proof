That is:\n\u2202v/\u2202x = 0 and \u2202v/\u2202y = 0\n\nNow, by the Cauchy-Riemann equations, we know that:\n\u2202u/\u2202x = \u2202v/\u2202y and \u2202u/\u2202y = -\u2202v/\u2202x\n\nSince we've established that both partial derivatives of v are zero, substituting this into the Cauchy-Riemann equations gives us:\n\u2202u/\u2202x = 0 and \u2202u/\u2202y = 0\n\nThis means that u is also constant throughout \u03a9, as both its partial derivatives are zero.

Our series then becomes $\\sum (e^{i\u03b8})^n/n$.\n\nFor z = 1 (\u03b8 = 0), this reduces to the harmonic series $\\sum 1/n$, which we know diverges.\n\nFor any other point on the unit circle (z \u2260 1), we can use Dirichlet's test for convergence.

This means that f has an infinite number of non-zero terms in its Taylor series expansion around at least one point.\n\nNow, let's consider what happens at any point z\u2080 in the complex plane. By the hypothesis, at least one coefficient in the Taylor series expansion around z\u2080 must be zero. Let's call a(z\u2080,n) the nth coefficient in the Taylor series expansion around z\u2080. This coefficient is given by f\u207d\u207f\u207e(z\u2080)/n!, where f\u207d\u207f\u207e is the nth derivative of f.\n\nHere's the key insight: since f is analytic everywhere, all its derivatives exist everywhere and are also analytic. Moreover, for each z\u2080, there must be at least one n \u2265 0 such that f\u207d\u207f\u207e(z\u2080) = 0.\n\nNow consider the function f\u207d\u1d4f\u207e for any fixed k.

However, by the hypothesis, f\u207d\u1d4f\u207e must have zeros at some points in the complex plane.\n\nHere's where we reach a contradiction: By the Identity Theorem for analytic functions, if an analytic function is zero on a set with an accumulation point, it must be identically zero. In our case, since every point in the complex plane must have some derivative that vanishes there, and we have infinitely many derivatives to consider, by the Pigeonhole Principle, at least one derivative f\u207d\u1d4f\u207e must vanish at infinitely many points (otherwise, we couldn't cover all points in the plane with finitely many derivatives).\n\nThese infinitely many zeros of f\u207d\u1d4f\u207e must have an accumulation point (by compactness of the extended complex plane). Therefore, f\u207d\u1d4f\u207e must be identically zero by the Identity Theorem.

        "informal_proof": "# Informal Proof:\n\nLet me explain why this fascinating result about zeros of holomorphic functions is true. This is known as part of the Blaschke condition.\n\nFirst, let's understand what we're dealing with: we have a bounded holomorphic function f in the unit disc that's not identically zero, and we need to show that the sum of the distances from its zeros to the unit circle (that's what 1-|z\u2099| represents) is finite.\n\nThe key insight comes from using Jensen's formula, which relates the zeros of a holomorphic function to its values on circles. For any r between 0 and 1, Jensen's formula tells us about the average of log|f| on the circle of radius r, the value of log|f(0)|, and the zeros of f inside this circle.\n\nSince f is bounded in the unit disc, let's say |f(z)| \u2264 M for some constant M. This means log|f(z)| \u2264 log M everywhere in the unit disc.\n\nNow, for each zero z\u2099, we can construct what's called a Blaschke factor: (z-z\u2099)/(1-z\u0304\u2099z). These factors have magnitude 1 on the unit circle but capture the contribution of each zero.\n\nThe crucial observation is that the product of these Blaschke factors (properly normalized) converges if and only if our sum \u2211(1-|z\u2099|) converges. This is because log|1-z\u0304\u2099z| behaves like (1-|z\u2099|) near each zero.\n\nIf our sum were infinite, the infinite product of Blaschke factors would diverge to zero too rapidly, which would contradict the boundedness of f. This is because we can divide f by these Blaschke factors to get another bounded holomorphic function, but this would be impossible if the product diverged too quickly.\n\nTherefore, the sum \u2211(1-|z\u2099|) must be finite. If it weren't, it would force f to be unbounded or identically zero, contradicting our assumptions.\n\nThis proof shows how the boundedness of f places strict constraints on how close its zeros can cluster near the unit circle - they can't accumulate too rapidly near the boundary.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unexpected end of input\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'let'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

This is the basic triangle inequality, and it makes geometric sense because the length of one side of a triangle cannot be greater than the sum of the lengths of the other two sides.\n\nWe can prove the general case for n numbers by applying this basic triangle inequality repeatedly.\n\nLet's start with z\u2081 + z\u2082 + ... + z\u2099. We can group this as (z\u2081 + z\u2082 + ... + z\u2099\u208b\u2081) + z\u2099.\n\nBy the basic triangle inequality:\n|z\u2081 + z\u2082 + ... + z\u2099| = |(z\u2081 + z\u2082 + ... + z\u2099\u208b\u2081) + z\u2099| \u2264 |z\u2081 + z\u2082 + ... + z\u2099\u208b\u2081| + |z\u2099|\n\nNow we can apply the same logic to the term |z\u2081 + z\u2082 + ... + z\u2099\u208b\u2081|.

Also, each of our original sets must be fully contained in its respective open set.\n\nHere's how we can prove this:\n\nFor any point a in set A, we can look at its distance to set B. Since B is closed and A and B don't overlap, this distance must be greater than zero. If it weren't, we'd have a point in A that's arbitrarily close to B, which can't happen since B contains all its limit points (being closed) and A and B are disjoint.\n\nSimilarly, for any point b in set B, its distance to set A must be greater than zero.\n\nNow, for each point a in A, let's consider the distance d(a,B) from a to set B. We can create an open ball around a with radius equal to half this distance. This ball can't intersect with B (because we used half the distance), and it only contains points closer to A than to B.\n\nWe can do the same thing for each point in B, creating open balls using half the distance to set A.\n\nIf we take the union of all the open balls around points in A, we get an open set U that contains A. Similarly, the union of all open balls around points in B gives us an open set V that contains B.\n\nThese open sets U and V cannot overlap. If they did, there would be a point that's both closer to A than to B, and closer to B than to A, which is impossible.\n\nTherefore, U and V are our required open sets that separate A and B: they're disjoint, open, and each contains its respective closed set.\n\nThis proves that A and B are separated.\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  Exists.intro fun a ha => ?m.2005 a ha\nargument\n  fun a ha => ?m.2005 a ha\nhas type\n  (a : X) \u2192 (ha : ?m.2006 a) \u2192 ?m.2003 a ha : Sort (imax (u_1 + 1) ?u.1996 ?u.1999)\nbut is expected to have type\n  Set X : Type u_1\nno goals to be solved\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  Exists.intro fun a ha => ?m.2005 a ha\nargument\n  fun a ha => ?m.2005 a ha\nhas type\n  (a : X) \u2192 (ha : ?m.2006 a) \u2192 ?m.2003 a ha : Sort (imax (u_1 + 1) ?u.1996 ?u.1999)\nbut is expected to have type\n  Set X : Type u_1\ninvalid constructor \u27e8...\u27e9, expected type must be an inductive type \n  ?m.2003 a ha\ninvalid constructor \u27e8...\u27e9, expected type must be an inductive type \n  ?m.4602 b hb\nno goals to be solved\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'infDist'\nunknown identifier 'infDist_pos_iff.mpr'\nunknown identifier 'infDist'\nunknown identifier 'infDist_le_dist_of_mem'\nunknown identifier 'infDist'\nunknown identifier 'infDist_pos_iff.mpr'\nunknown identifier 'infDist'\nunknown identifier 'infDist_le_dist_of_mem'\nunknown identifier 'ball'\nunsolved goals\nX : Type u_1\ninst\u271d : MetricSpace X\nA B : Set X\nhA : IsClosed A\nhB : IsClosed B\nhAB : Disjoint A B\n\u03b5A : X \u2192 \u211d\n\u03b5A_pos : \u2200 a \u2208 A, \u03b5A a > 0\nh\u03b5A : \u2200 a \u2208 A, \u2200 b \u2208 B, dist a b \u2265 \u03b5A a\n\u03b5B : X \u2192 \u211d\n\u03b5B_pos : \u2200 b \u2208 B, \u03b5B b > 0\nh\u03b5B : \u2200 b \u2208 B, \u2200 a \u2208 A, dist b a \u2265 \u03b5B b\n\u22a2 SeparatedNhds A B\nPlease revise the proof.",

Here's the reasoning:\n\n1) First, let's recall that in a metric space, for any point x and positive real number r, we can define an open ball B(x,r) as all points whose distance to x is less than r.\n\n2) For any compact metric space K, we know it must be totally bounded. This means that for any \u03b5 > 0, we can cover K with finitely many open balls of radius \u03b5.\n\n3) Let's construct our countable base. For each n \u2265 1, consider covering K with open balls of radius 1/n. Since K is compact (and thus totally bounded), we can find a finite number of points x\u2081, x\u2082, ..., x\u2096(n) such that the balls B(x\u1d62, 1/n) cover K.\n\n4) Let's collect all these balls for all positive integers n. That is, consider the collection:\n   {B(x, 1/n) | n \u2265 1, x is a center point in our nth cover}\n\n5) This collection is countable because:\n   - For each n, we only need finitely many balls\n   - We're taking the union over countably many values of n\n   - A countable union of finite sets is countable\n\n6) Now, we need to show this collection is indeed a base.

The key insight is that points outside of P (the condensation points) must be relatively \"isolated\" from each other.\n\nSuppose there are uncountably many points in E that are not in P. Let's call this set Q = E \\ P.\n\nTake any point x in Q. Since x is not a condensation point of E, there must exist some neighborhood around x that contains at most countably many points of E. This is because if every neighborhood of x contained uncountably many points of E, then x would be a condensation point by definition.\n\nFor each point x in Q, we can find a rational radius r(x) such that the open ball B(x, r(x)) contains at most countably many points of E. We can always choose a rational radius because rational numbers are dense in the reals.\n\nNow, consider the collection of all these open balls {B(x, r(x))} for x in Q. Each ball contains at most countably many points of E, and therefore at most countably many points of Q.\n\nHere's the crucial part: no point of Q can be a limit point of Q. If it were, then every neighborhood of that point would contain infinitely many points of E (specifically, points from Q), contradicting our construction of the balls B(x, r(x)).\n\nTherefore, Q must be a discrete set - meaning each point in Q has a neighborhood containing no other points of Q. In Euclidean space, any discrete set must be countable (this is because we can surround each point with a ball of rational radius containing only that point, and there can only be countably many such disjoint balls in R\u1d4f).\n\nThis contradicts our assumption that Q was uncountable.\n\nTherefore, our initial assumption must be wrong, and Q = E \\ P must be countable, which is what we wanted to prove.\nPrevious attempt failed with: push_neg made no progress\nunknown constant 'Set.not_countable_iff_nonempty.mpr'\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  hx'.right U\nargument\n  U\nhas type\n  Set (EuclideanSpace \u211d (Fin k)) : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  x \u2208 P : Prop\ninvalid field notation, type is not of the form (C ...) where C is a constant\n  hx''\nhas type\n  \u2200 U \u2208 \ud835\udcdd x, (P \u2229 E).Nonempty \u2227 \u00ac(P \u2229 E).Countable\nunknown identifier 'ball'\nPlease revise the proof.",

Being absolutely convergent means that \u03a3|a\u2099| and \u03a3|b\u2099| both converge to finite values - let's call these sums A and B respectively.\n\nThe Cauchy product of these series gives us a new series \u03a3c\u2099, where each c\u2099 is formed by summing products of terms whose indices add up to n. Specifically:\nc\u2099 = a\u2080b\u2099 + a\u2081b\u2099\u208b\u2081 + ... + a\u2099b\u2080\n\nTo prove absolute convergence of the Cauchy product, we need to show that \u03a3|c\u2099| converges.\n\nLooking at |c\u2099|, we can use the triangle inequality:\n|c\u2099| \u2264 |a\u2080b\u2099| + |a\u2081b\u2099\u208b\u2081| + ... + |a\u2099b\u2080|\n\nNow comes the clever part. If we look at the double sum of all possible products |a\u1d62||b\u2c7c|, this includes all terms that appear in \u03a3|c\u2099| and possibly more. In fact, we can rearrange this double sum in two ways:\n\n(\u03a3|a\u1d62|)(\u03a3|b\u2c7c|) = \u03a3\u1d62 \u03a3\u2c7c |a\u1d62||b\u2c7c|\n\nSince we know \u03a3|a\u2099| converges to A and \u03a3|b\u2099| converges to B, their product AB is finite and equals this double sum.\n\nThe terms in \u03a3|c\u2099| are just a regrouping of terms from this double sum (specifically, grouping terms where i+j=n). Since the double sum converges absolutely to AB, any regrouping of its terms (including our \u03a3|c\u2099|) must also converge, and the sum must be less than or equal to AB.\n\nTherefore, \u03a3|c\u2099| converges, which means the Cauchy product converges absolutely.\n\nThis proof fundamentally relies on the fact that when we have absolute convergence, we can rearrange and regroup terms freely without affecting convergence, and that the double sum of products can be viewed both as the product of the individual sums and as containing all terms in the Cauchy product.\nPrevious attempt failed with: \nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ':='; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ':='; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "# Informal Proof:\n\nLet me explain why this intersection contains exactly one point through clear reasoning.\n\nFirst, let's show that the intersection can't be empty. Since we're working in a complete metric space, we can use the nested set property. Each En is closed and bounded (hence compact in a metric space), and each set contains the next one (En \u2283 En+1). In a complete metric space, a nested sequence of non-empty compact sets must have a non-empty intersection. So we know \u2229En contains at least one point.\n\nNow, let's show that the intersection can't contain more than one point. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that the intersection contained two different points, let's call them p and q. Since these points are different, they must be some positive distance apart - let's call this distance d > 0.\n\nBut here's where the diameter condition becomes crucial. The diameter of each En approaches zero as n approaches infinity. This means that for any positive number (including our distance d), we can find some N where the diameter of EN is less than d/2.\n\nSince both p and q are in every En (including EN), they must be in EN. But this is impossible because EN has a diameter less than d/2, yet it would contain two points that are distance d apart. This contradicts the definition of diameter as the supreme distance between any two points in a set.\n\nTherefore, our assumption that the intersection contained two points must be wrong. Combined with our earlier proof that the intersection isn't empty, we can conclude that the intersection must contain exactly one point.\n\nThis single point can be thought of as the \"limit\" of the nested sequence of sets, which makes intuitive sense given that the sets are getting arbitrarily small in diameter.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

Let's say f(p) = k for some non-zero real number k.\n\nBecause f is continuous at p, we know that for any small positive number \u03b5, we can find a neighborhood around p where f stays within \u03b5 of f(p).\n\nLet's specifically choose \u03b5 = |k|/2 (half the absolute value of f(p)).

We choose these points so that any point in E is within distance \u03b4 of at least one of these points.\n\nNow, for any point x in E, there must be one of our chosen points (let's call it x\u1d62) that's within \u03b4 of x. By uniform continuity, this means |f(x) - f(x\u1d62)| < \u03b5.\n\nAmong our finite set of points {x\u2081, x\u2082, ..., x\u2099}, f must achieve some maximum value M and some minimum value m (since we're only looking at finitely many points). Then, for any point x in E, f(x) can't be more than \u03b5 above M or more than \u03b5 below m, because x must be within \u03b4 of one of our chosen points.\n\nTherefore, f(x) is bounded below by m - \u03b5 and above by M + \u03b5 for all x in E. Since these are finite numbers, f is bounded on E.\n\nThis proves that any uniformly continuous function on a bounded set must be bounded.\nPrevious attempt failed with: invalid constructor \u27e8...\u27e9, expected type must be an inductive type \n  \u2200 \u2983x : \u211d\u2984, x \u2208 E\u1d9c\u1d9c \u2192 \u2200 \u2983y : \u211d\u2984, y \u2208 E\u1d9c\u1d9c \u2192 (fun x y => |x - y|) x y \u2264 a\nPlease revise the proof.",

We have a uniformly continuous function f from metric space X to metric space Y. This means that for any small distance \u03b5 > 0 we want in Y, we can find a corresponding distance \u03b4 > 0 in X such that whenever two points in X are closer than \u03b4, their images under f will be closer than \u03b5.\n\nNow, let's take any Cauchy sequence {x\u2099} in X. By definition of a Cauchy sequence, for any positive distance \u03b4, we can find some point in the sequence (let's call it position N) where all terms after N are within \u03b4 of each other.\n\nHere's the key insight: Let's pick any \u03b5 > 0 in Y. Because f is uniformly continuous, we can find the corresponding \u03b4 that works for this \u03b5. Then, because {x\u2099} is Cauchy, we can find that position N where all terms after N are within this \u03b4 of each other.\n\nWhat happens when we apply f to these terms? Well, if we take any two terms x\u2098 and x\u2099 that come after position N, we know:\n1. Their distance is less than \u03b4 (because {x\u2099} is Cauchy)\n2. Therefore, by uniform continuity, the distance between f(x\u2098) and f(x\u2099) must be less than \u03b5\n\nThis means that after position N, all terms in the sequence {f(x\u2099)} are within \u03b5 of each other. Since this works for any \u03b5 > 0 we choose, this is exactly the definition of a Cauchy sequence in Y.\n\nTherefore, {f(x\u2099)} is indeed a Cauchy sequence in Y.\n\nThe crucial point here is that uniform continuity (not just continuity) ensures that we can find a single position N that works for all terms after it, which is exactly what we need for the image sequence to be Cauchy.\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  UniformContinuous.comp hf hx\nargument\n  hx\nhas type\n  CauchySeq x : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  UniformContinuous ?m.1287 : Prop\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  UniformContinuous.comp hf hx\nargument\n  hx\nhas type\n  CauchySeq x : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  UniformContinuous ?m.1287 : Prop\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  UniformContinuous.comp hf hx\nargument\n  hx\nhas type\n  CauchySeq x : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  UniformContinuous ?m.1287 : Prop\nPlease revise the proof.",

Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. First, let's understand what we know:\n   - f is continuous (no \"jumps\" or \"breaks\" in the function)\n   - f is an open mapping (it maps open sets to open sets)\n\n2. Consider any three real numbers a < b < c. To prove monotonicity, we need to show that either f(a) < f(b) < f(c) or f(a) > f(b) > f(c).\n\n3. Key insight: Because f is an open mapping, it must map any open interval to an open interval. This means that f((a,c)) must be an open interval.\n\n4. Now, since b is between a and c, f(b) must lie in the open interval f((a,c)). This is because:\n   - The continuity of f means that f(b) must be connected to both f(a) and f(c)\n   - The open mapping property means f(b) cannot be an endpoint of f((a,c))\n\n5. Therefore, f(b) must lie strictly between f(a) and f(c). In other words:\n   - Either f(a) < f(b) < f(c)\n   - Or f(a) > f(b) > f(c)\n\n6. This ordering relationship must be consistent throughout the domain because:\n   - If the ordering changed direction at any point, it would violate the open mapping property\n   - Such a change in direction would create a local maximum or minimum, which would map some open neighborhood to a non-open set\n\n7. Therefore, f must maintain the same ordering throughout its domain, making it either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.\n\nThus, we have proved that any continuous open mapping from R to R must be monotonic.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

Since K and F are disjoint, p and q must be different points, so the distance between them, d(p,q), must be positive.\n\nNow, for any fixed point p in K, consider the function f_p(q) = d(p,q) that measures the distance from p to points q in F. Since F is closed and the distance function is continuous, and since f_p(q) is always positive (as K and F are disjoint), this function must achieve a minimum value on F. Let's call this minimum value m(p) for each p.\n\nSo for each p in K, we have found the closest point in F to p, and m(p) represents this minimum distance. Now consider how m(p) varies as p moves around in K. This gives us a function m from K to the positive real numbers, and importantly, this function is continuous (because the distance function is continuous).\n\nSince K is compact and m is a continuous function from K to the positive real numbers, m must achieve a minimum value on K - let's call this minimum value \u03b4. This \u03b4 must be positive because m(p) is positive for every p.\n\nThis \u03b4 is exactly what we're looking for! For any point p in K and any point q in F, the distance d(p,q) must be at least as large as the minimum distance from p to F (which is m(p)), which in turn must be at least as large as \u03b4 (since \u03b4 is the minimum of all such m(p)).\n\nTherefore, we have found a positive number \u03b4 such that d(p,q) > \u03b4 whenever p is in K and q is in F, which is exactly what we needed to prove.\n\nThe key insight is that compactness of K ensures we can find a \"global\" minimum distance, not just a minimum distance from each individual point of K to F.\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  Set.disjoint_iff.mp hKF hp\nargument\n  hp\nhas type\n  p \u2208 K : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  p \u2208 K \u2229 F : Prop\nunknown identifier 'inf\u209b'\nunknown constant 'Real.inf\u209b_le_of_le'\nunknown constant 'Real.inf\u209b_le'\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'Metric.isClosed_iff.mp'\ntactic 'apply' failed, failed to unify\n  \u2203 x \u2208 K, \u2200 y \u2208 K, ?f y \u2264 ?f x\nwith\n  \u2203 \u03b4 > 0, \u2200 p \u2208 K, \u2200 q \u2208 F, dist p q \u2265 \u03b4\nX : Type u_1\ninst\u271d : MetricSpace X\nK F : Set X\nhK : IsCompact K\nhF : IsClosed F\nhKF : Disjoint K F\nh1 : \u2200 p \u2208 K, \u2203 \u03b4 > 0, \u2200 q \u2208 F, dist p q \u2265 \u03b4\n\u22a2 \u2203 \u03b4 > 0, \u2200 p \u2208 K, \u2200 q \u2208 F, dist p q \u2265 \u03b4\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'inf\u209b'\nunknown constant 'Real.inf\u209b_pos'\nunknown identifier 'inf\u209b'\nunknown constant 'Real.inf\u209b_le'\ninvalid field 'exists_forall_ge_of_isClosed', the environment does not contain 'IsCompact.exists_forall_ge_of_isClosed'\n  hK\nhas type\n  IsCompact K\ninvalid field notation, type is not of the form (C ...) where C is a constant\n  hK\nhas type\n  ?m.2385 \u2264 \ud835\udcdf K \u2192 \u2203 x \u2208 K, ClusterPt x ?m.2385\nPlease revise the proof.",

First, let's understand what we're given: for any two real numbers x and y, the difference between their f-values is bounded by the square of their difference. That is, |f(x) - f(y)| \u2264 (x-y)\u00b2.\n\n2. Now, let's pick any two points a and b in the real line. We'll prove that f(a) must equal f(b).\n\n3. Here's the key insight: Let's look at what happens when we consider points that are very close together. If we divide the interval from a to b into n equal parts, making the distance between consecutive points very small, we can use our given inequality multiple times.\n\n4. Let's call the distance between a and b as h = b-a. When we divide this into n parts, each small interval has length h/n.\n\n5. By our given inequality, for any two consecutive points in our division that are h/n apart, the difference in their f-values must be at most (h/n)\u00b2.\n\n6. Now, to get from f(a) to f(b), we need to add up n of these small differences. By the triangle inequality, the total difference |f(b) - f(a)| must be less than or equal to n times (h/n)\u00b2.\n\n7. Therefore: |f(b) - f(a)| \u2264 n(h/n)\u00b2 = h\u00b2/n\n\n8. Here's the crucial part: This inequality holds for any value of n we choose. As we make n larger and larger, h\u00b2/n gets closer and closer to 0.\n\n9. Since this is true for any n, and n can be made arbitrarily large, we must have |f(b) - f(a)| = 0.\n\n10. Therefore, f(a) = f(b).\n\n11. Since a and b were arbitrary points, this means f takes the same value everywhere, which is the definition of a constant function.\n\nTherefore, f must be constant.\n\nThis proof shows that the given condition forces any two values of the function to be equal, which means the function can only be constant.

The key idea is to show that f is strictly increasing, which would prove it's one-to-one.\n\nFirst, let's look at the derivative of f(x). Using the chain rule:\nf'(x) = 1 + \u03b5g'(x)\n\nWe know that g' is bounded, meaning |g'(x)| \u2264 M for all x. This tells us that g'(x) can't get arbitrarily large in either the positive or negative direction.\n\nNow, for f to be strictly increasing, we need f'(x) > 0 for all x. Let's see when this happens:\n\n1 + \u03b5g'(x) > 0\n\nSince |g'(x)| \u2264 M, the worst case (smallest possible value of f'(x)) occurs when g'(x) = -M. Plugging this in:\n\n1 + \u03b5(-M) > 0\n1 - \u03b5M > 0\n\u03b5 < 1/M\n\nTherefore, if we choose any \u03b5 smaller than 1/M, we guarantee that f'(x) is always positive (specifically, f'(x) > 1 - \u03b5M > 0).\n\nWhen a function has a positive derivative everywhere, it is strictly increasing. And when a function is strictly increasing, it must be one-to-one, because each y-value can only be reached once as x increases.\n\nThus, by choosing \u03b5 < 1/M, we ensure that f is one-to-one.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'apply' failed, failed to unify\n  DifferentiableAt ?\ud835\udd5c (fun x => ?c) ?x\nwith\n  DifferentiableAt \u211d (fun x => \u03b5 * g x) x\ncase hg\ng : \u211d \u2192 \u211d\nhg : Continuous g\nM : \u211d\nhM : \u2200 (x : \u211d), |deriv g x| \u2264 M\n\u03b5 : \u211d\nh\u03b5 : \u03b5 > 0\nh\u03b5' : \u03b5 < 1 / M\nx y : \u211d\nh : (fun x => x + \u03b5 * g x) x = (fun x => x + \u03b5 * g x) y\n\u22a2 DifferentiableAt \u211d (fun x => \u03b5 * g x) x\ntactic 'apply' failed, failed to unify\n  DifferentiableAt ?\ud835\udd5c (fun x => ?c) ?x\nwith\n  DifferentiableAt \u211d (fun x => \u03b5 * g x) y\ncase hg\ng : \u211d \u2192 \u211d\nhg : Continuous g\nM : \u211d\nhM : \u2200 (x : \u211d), |deriv g x| \u2264 M\n\u03b5 : \u211d\nh\u03b5 : \u03b5 > 0\nh\u03b5' : \u03b5 < 1 / M\nx y : \u211d\nh : (fun x => x + \u03b5 * g x) x = (fun x => x + \u03b5 * g x) y\nh1 : deriv (fun x => x + \u03b5 * g x) x = 1 + \u03b5 * deriv g x\n\u22a2 DifferentiableAt \u211d (fun x => \u03b5 * g x) y\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  (fun x => x + \u03b5 * g x) x\ng : \u211d \u2192 \u211d\nhg : Continuous g\nM : \u211d\nhM : \u2200 (x : \u211d), |deriv g x| \u2264 M\n\u03b5 : \u211d\nh\u03b5 : \u03b5 > 0\nh\u03b5' : \u03b5 < 1 / M\nx y : \u211d\nh : (fun x => x + \u03b5 * g x) x = (fun x => x + \u03b5 * g x) y\nh1 : deriv (fun x => x + \u03b5 * g x) x = 1 + \u03b5 * deriv g x\nh2 : deriv (fun x => x + \u03b5 * g x) y = 1 + \u03b5 * deriv g y\n\u22a2 deriv (fun x => x + \u03b5 * g x) x = deriv (fun x => x + \u03b5 * g x) y\napplication type mismatch\n  mul_right_cancel\u2080 h\u03b5\nargument\n  h\u03b5\nhas type\n  \u03b5 > 0 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  ?m.20039 \u2260 0 : Prop\nunknown identifier 'deriv_eq_on_of_eq_deriv'\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: simp made no progress\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase h\ng : \u211d \u2192 \u211d\nhg : Continuous g\nM : \u211d\nhM : \u2200 (x : \u211d), |deriv g x| \u2264 M\n\u03b5 : \u211d\nh\u03b5 : \u03b5 > 0\nh\u03b5' : \u03b5 < 1 / M\nh1 : \u2200 (x : \u211d), deriv (fun x => x + \u03b5 * g x) x = 1 + \u03b5 * deriv g x\nx : \u211d\na\u271d : 0 \u2265 1 + \u03b5 * deriv g x\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  (fun x => x + \u03b5 * g x) x\ng : \u211d \u2192 \u211d\nhg : Continuous g\nM : \u211d\nhM : \u2200 (x : \u211d), |deriv g x| \u2264 M\n\u03b5 : \u211d\nh\u03b5 : \u03b5 > 0\nh\u03b5' : \u03b5 < 1 / M\nh1 : \u2200 (x : \u211d), deriv (fun x => x + \u03b5 * g x) x = 1 + \u03b5 * deriv g x\nh2 : \u2200 (x : \u211d), 1 + \u03b5 * deriv g x > 0\nx y : \u211d\nh : (fun x => x + \u03b5 * g x) x = (fun x => x + \u03b5 * g x) y\n\u22a2 1 + \u03b5 * deriv g x = 1 + \u03b5 * deriv g y\napplication type mismatch\n  LT.lt.ne' (h2 x) (LT.lt.ne' (h2 y))\nargument\n  LT.lt.ne' (h2 y)\nhas type\n  1 + \u03b5 * deriv g y \u2260 0 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  1 + \u03b5 * deriv g x = 0 : Prop\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: invalid field 'differentiableAt', the environment does not contain 'Continuous.differentiableAt'\n  hg\nhas type\n  Continuous g\nsimp made no progress\ninvalid field 'differentiableAt', the environment does not contain 'Continuous.differentiableAt'\n  hg\nhas type\n  Continuous g\nsimp made no progress\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  (fun x => x + \u03b5 * g x) x\ng : \u211d \u2192 \u211d\nhg : Continuous g\nM : \u211d\nhM : \u2200 (x : \u211d), |deriv g x| \u2264 M\n\u03b5 : \u211d\nh\u03b5 : \u03b5 > 0\nh\u03b5' : \u03b5 < 1 / M\nx y : \u211d\nh : (fun x => x + \u03b5 * g x) x = (fun x => x + \u03b5 * g x) y\nh1 : deriv (fun x => x + \u03b5 * g x) x = 1 + \u03b5 * deriv g x\nh2 : deriv (fun x => x + \u03b5 * g x) y = 1 + \u03b5 * deriv g y\n\u22a2 deriv (fun x => x + \u03b5 * g x) x = deriv (fun x => x + \u03b5 * g x) y\napplication type mismatch\n  mul_right_cancel\u2080 h\u03b5\nargument\n  h\u03b5\nhas type\n  \u03b5 > 0 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  ?m.13484 \u2260 0 : Prop\nunknown identifier 'deriv_eq_on_of_eq_deriv'\nPlease revise the proof.",

This is not true for general groups, so it's a special property that will be key to our proof.\n\nLet's look at the commutator $aba^{-1}b^{-1}$ that we need to study. A useful way to approach this is to consider what happens when we conjugate $b^n$ by $a$.\n\nWhen we conjugate $b^n$ by $a$, we get $ab^na^{-1}$. Due to our special property, we know that $(ab)^n = a^n b^n$. Rearranging this, we can say that $b^n = a^{-n}(ab)^n$.\n\nNow, let's substitute this expression for $b^n$ into $ab^na^{-1}$:\n$ab^na^{-1} = a(a^{-n}(ab)^n)a^{-1} = a^{1-n}(ab)^n$\n\nThis means that conjugating $b^n$ by $a$ results in multiplying $b^n$ by $a^{1-n}$ on the left and $(ab)^n$ on the right.\n\nThe commutator $aba^{-1}b^{-1}$ raised to power $n$ is related to this conjugation. In fact, after some manipulation, we can show that $(aba^{-1}b^{-1})^n$ represents the difference between $b^n$ and its conjugate by $a$.\n\nWhen we raise the commutator to power $n(n-1)$, we effectively perform this conjugation comparison $n-1$ times. Each time, we accumulate factors that eventually cancel out due to the special property of the group.\n\nThrough this process, all the terms end up canceling each other out, leaving us with the identity element $e$. This is because the power $n(n-1)$ is precisely what's needed to make all the conjugation factors come full circle and cancel.\n\nTherefore, $(aba^{-1}b^{-1})^{n(n-1)} = e$ for all $a, b \\in G$.\n\nThe key insight is that the special property $(ab)^n = a^n b^n$ forces commutators to have finite order, and $n(n-1)$ is exactly the right power to make them trivial.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  ?a * (?b * ?c)\nG : Type u_1\ninst\u271d : Group G\nn : \u2115\nhn : n > 1\nh : \u2200 (a b : G), (a * b) ^ n = a ^ n * b ^ n\na b : G\n\u22a2 a ^ n * (a * b * a\u207b\u00b9 * b\u207b\u00b9) ^ n = a ^ n * 1\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  ?a * (?b * ?c)\nG : Type u_1\ninst\u271d : Group G\nn : \u2115\nhn : n > 1\nh : \u2200 (a b : G), (a * b) ^ n = a ^ n * b ^ n\na b : G\n\u22a2 a ^ n * (a * b * a\u207b\u00b9 * b\u207b\u00b9) ^ n = a ^ n * 1\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  ?a * (?b * ?c)\nG : Type u_1\ninst\u271d : Group G\nn : \u2115\nhn : n > 1\nh : \u2200 (a b : G), (a * b) ^ n = a ^ n * b ^ n\na b : G\nh1 : (a * b) ^ n = a ^ n * b ^ n\n\u22a2 a ^ n * (a * b * a\u207b\u00b9 * b\u207b\u00b9) ^ n = a ^ n * 1\nPlease revise the proof.",

The key insight is that H is the unique subgroup of order p^n in G, and therefore any automorphism of G must map H to itself.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\nFirst, let's understand what makes H special. H has order p^n, and G has order p^nm where p doesn't divide m. This means that H is a Sylow p-subgroup of G, as it contains all the p-power factors of G's order.\n\nNow, since G is abelian, we can use the fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups to break G into a direct product of its Sylow subgroups. Specifically, G \u2245 P \u00d7 Q, where P is the Sylow p-subgroup (of order p^n) and Q is the complement (of order m).\n\nHere's the crucial part: in an abelian group, the Sylow p-subgroup is unique. This is because if we had two different Sylow p-subgroups, their product would create a larger p-subgroup, which is impossible since we already have all the p-factors in each Sylow p-subgroup.\n\nSince H has order p^n, it must be exactly this unique Sylow p-subgroup of G. Any automorphism of G must preserve the order of elements, and therefore must map the Sylow p-subgroup to itself (as it's the only subgroup containing all elements whose orders are powers of p).\n\nTherefore, for any automorphism \u03c6 of G, we must have \u03c6(H) = H, which is exactly what it means for H to be a characteristic subgroup of G.\n\nThe key to this proof is recognizing that the uniqueness of the Sylow p-subgroup in an abelian group, combined with the order conditions, forces any automorphism to keep H fixed as a set.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown constant 'Subgroup.is_characteristic_of_prime_of_unique_of_order_eq_prime_pow'\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  Fintype \u21a5\u03c6.range\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  Fintype \u21a5\u03c6.range\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nunknown constant 'Subgroup.eq_of_card_eq_of_order_eq'\ninvalid field notation, type is not of the form (C ...) where C is a constant\n  Subgroup.Characteristic\nhas type\n  Subgroup ?m.10802 \u2192 Prop\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  Fintype \u21a5K\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nunknown constant 'Subgroup.eq_of_card_eq_of_order_eq'\nunknown constant 'Subgroup.is_characteristic_of_unique_of_order_eq_prime_pow'\nPlease revise the proof.",

Here's the reasoning:\n\nFirst, note that 9 = 3\u00b2, so we're dealing with a group whose order is the square of a prime number.\n\nBy Lagrange's theorem, for any element x in the group, the order of x must divide the group order 9. Therefore, the possible orders for any element are 1, 3, or 9.\n\nThe identity element has order 1. Any non-identity element must have order either 3 or 9. However, if there were an element of order 9, it would generate the entire group cyclically, making the group cyclic and therefore abelian.\n\nSo let's consider the case where no element has order 9. In this case, every non-identity element must have order 3. This means that for any non-identity element x, we have x\u00b3 = e (where e is the identity element).\n\nNow, let's consider the center Z(G) of the group. The center cannot be trivial (just the identity) because in that case, by the class equation, the size of each non-trivial conjugacy class would have to divide the group order 9 and be greater than 1. The only such possibility is 3, but having conjugacy classes of size 3 would require more than 9 total elements.\n\nTherefore, Z(G) must be non-trivial. Since its order must divide 9, and it can't be the whole group (as we assumed there's no element of order 9), Z(G) must have order 3.\n\nThis means that G/Z(G) also has order 3, making it cyclic. When we have both G/Z(G) and Z(G) of prime order, the group must be abelian. This is because any commutator must lie in a proper subgroup of Z(G), but Z(G) has prime order, so the only proper subgroup is the trivial group.\n\nTherefore, all commutators are trivial, which means the group is abelian.\n\nThus, we've shown that a group of order 9 must be abelian in all possible cases.\nPrevious attempt failed with: expected ';' or line break\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: expected ';' or line break\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: expected ';' or line break\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

When we multiply any two elements from S, their product must also satisfy \u03c6(product) = (product)\u207b\u00b9, as we just showed.\n\nHere's where we use a counting argument: If we take any element y in G, we can write it as y = ab where a and b are from our set S (the elements where \u03c6(x) = x\u207b\u00b9). This is possible because S is so large - when we have more than 3/4 of the elements in S, by the pigeonhole principle, for any y, we can always find such a and b in S where y = ab.\n\nWhy? Because if we fix any a in S and look at all products ab where b is also in S, we must get y somewhere in these products. If we didn't, it would contradict the size of S being more than 3/4 of G.\n\nTherefore, every element y in G can be written as a product of two elements from S. But we already showed that such products must satisfy \u03c6(y) = y\u207b\u00b9.\n\nThis proves that \u03c6(y) = y\u207b\u00b9 for all y in G.\n\nFinally, to show G is abelian, take any two elements x and y in G. We can write:\nxy = \u03c6(\u03c6(xy)) = \u03c6(\u03c6(x)\u03c6(y)) = \u03c6(x\u207b\u00b9y\u207b\u00b9) = (x\u207b\u00b9y\u207b\u00b9)\u207b\u00b9 = yx\n\nTherefore, G is abelian.\nPrevious attempt failed with: \nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: \nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: function expected at\n  h1\nterm has type\n  \u03c6 x\u271d = x\u271d\u207b\u00b9\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, equality or iff proof expected\n  ?m.3838\ncase right\nG : Type u_1\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : Group G\ninst\u271d : Fintype G\n\u03c6 : G \u2243* G\nI : Finset G\nhI : \u2200 x \u2208 I, \u03c6 x = x\u207b\u00b9\nhI1 : 0.75 * \u2191(card G) \u2264 \u2191(card { x // x \u2208 I })\nx\u271d : G\nh1 : \u03c6 x\u271d = x\u271d\u207b\u00b9\nx y : G\n\u22a2 x * y = y * x\nPlease revise the proof.",

By Sylow's theorems:\n- G has a unique Sylow p-subgroup P of order p (since p > q)\n- G has some number of Sylow q-subgroups, and this number must divide p and be \u2261 1 (mod q)\n\nSince P is normal (being unique), and we can find some element y of order q, G must be a semidirect product of P and \u27e8y\u27e9.\n\nNow, P is cyclic (being of prime order), so let's say P = \u27e8x\u27e9. The action of y on x by conjugation must be an automorphism of P of order q. Since Aut(P) \u2245 (Z/pZ)*, which has order p-1, and q divides p-1, there are exactly q-1 possible non-trivial actions of order q.\n\nHowever, all these non-trivial actions are conjugate to each other in Aut(P), because (Z/pZ)* is cyclic. This means that any two choices of non-trivial actions result in isomorphic semidirect products.\n\nSince we want G to be nonabelian, we must choose a non-trivial action. Therefore, all possible nonabelian groups of order pq constructed this way are isomorphic to each other.\n\nFinally, we know that every group of order pq must be of this form (either a semidirect product with trivial action - giving us the abelian case - or with non-trivial action - giving us the nonabelian case).\n\nTherefore, there is exactly one isomorphism class of nonabelian groups of order pq under these conditions.\nPrevious attempt failed with: \nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: \nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: \nPlease revise the proof.",

Here's the reasoning:\n\nFirst, let's consider what elements are in (b). Since b has prime order p, we know that (b) consists of the elements {e, b, b\u00b2, ..., b^(p-1)}, and these are all distinct because p is prime. The size of (b) is exactly p.\n\nNow, let's look at A \u2229 (b). This intersection is a subgroup of (b), because it's the intersection of two subgroups. By Lagrange's theorem, the size of any subgroup of (b) must divide the order of (b), which is p.\n\nSince p is prime, the only possible sizes for A \u2229 (b) are 1 or p. If the size were p, then the entire cyclic subgroup (b) would be contained in A. But this would mean b \u2208 A, which contradicts our given assumption that b \u2209 A.\n\nTherefore, A \u2229 (b) must have size 1, which means it can only contain the identity element e. Thus, A \u2229 (b) = (e).\n\nThe key insight here is that the primality of the order of b forces the intersection to be trivial - there's no room for a proper non-trivial subgroup of (b) because p is prime, and we can rule out the whole subgroup (b) being in the intersection because we know b \u2209 A.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  ?m.1343 \u2208 Subgroup.closure ?m.1342\ncase a.intro\nG : Type u_1\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : Group G\nA : Subgroup G\ninst\u271d : A.Normal\nb : G\nhp : (orderOf b).Prime\nx : G\nhxA : x \u2208 A\nhx : \u2200 (K : Subgroup G), {b} \u2286 \u2191K \u2192 x \u2208 K\n\u22a2 x = 1\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  ?m.1828 ^ ?m.1829 = 1\ncase H\nG : Type u_1\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : Group G\nA : Subgroup G\ninst\u271d : A.Normal\nb : G\nhp : (orderOf b).Prime\nx : G\nhxA : x \u2208 A\nhx : \u2200 (K : Subgroup G), {b} \u2286 \u2191K \u2192 x \u2208 K\n\u22a2 orderOf x \u2223 1\nunknown constant 'Subgroup.le_bot_iff'\nsimp made no progress\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: type mismatch\n  hx.right\nhas type\n  \u2203 n, b ^ n = x : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  x \u2208 Subgroup.closure {b} : Prop\ninvalid field 'normal', the environment does not contain 'Subgroup.normal'\n  A\nhas type\n  Subgroup G\nsimp made no progress\nPlease revise the proof.",

Also, since P is normal in G (denoted by P \u25b9 G), we know that for any element g in G, gPg\u207b\u00b9 = P.\n\nNow, let \u03c6 be any automorphism of G.

This means that if \u03c3 moves an element (i.e., \u03c3(x) \u2260 x), then \u03c4 must fix that element (\u03c4(x) = x), and vice versa.\n\nNow, suppose for contradiction that \u03c3 is not the identity permutation.

Let's call \u03c3(a) = b, where b \u2260 a.\n\nSince \u03c3 and \u03c4 disturb no common elements, and \u03c3 moves a, we know that \u03c4 must fix a, so \u03c4(a) = a.\n\nNow, since \u03c3\u03c4 = e (the identity permutation), we must have (\u03c3\u03c4)(a) = a.\n\nLet's evaluate (\u03c3\u03c4)(a):\n1.

Since we're working in Z\u2082, each entry in our 2\u00d72 matrices can only be 0 or 1. However, we only want matrices with non-zero determinant. Let's find all such matrices:\n\nFor a 2\u00d72 matrix [[a b], [c d]], the determinant is ad - bc. In Z\u2082, this must be 1 (since it can't be 0).\n\nIf we list all possible 2\u00d72 matrices with entries in Z\u2082 and calculate their determinants, we find exactly 6 matrices with non-zero determinant:\n- [[1 0], [0 1]] (the identity matrix)\n- [[0 1], [1 0]]\n- [[1 1], [1 0]]\n- [[1 0], [1 1]]\n- [[0 1], [1 1]]\n- [[1 1], [0 1]]\n\nNow, we know that S\u2083 also has exactly 6 elements.

For example, the product of two order-2 elements gives an order-3 element, just like in S\u2083 where multiplying two transpositions gives a 3-cycle.\n\nSince both groups have the same size, the same number of elements of each order, and the same multiplication patterns, they must be isomorphic.

The zero element of R is always in L(a) because 0\u22c5a = 0, so L(a) contains at least one element.\n\nNext, let's show that L(a) is closed under addition. Take any two elements x and y in L(a). This means that xa = 0 and ya = 0. We need to show that (x + y) is also in L(a). Consider (x + y)a:\n- (x + y)a = xa + ya (by distributivity in R)\n- But xa = 0 and ya = 0 (since x and y are in L(a))\n- So (x + y)a = 0 + 0 = 0\nTherefore, (x + y) is in L(a).\n\nNow, let's show that L(a) is closed under multiplication by any ring element. Take any x in L(a) and any r in R. We need to show that rx is in L(a). Consider (rx)a:\n- (rx)a = r(xa) (by associativity in R)\n- Since x is in L(a), we know xa = 0\n- Therefore, (rx)a = r(0) = 0\nSo rx is in L(a).\n\nSince we've shown that L(a) is non-empty, closed under addition, and closed under multiplication by any ring element, we can conclude that L(a) is indeed an ideal of R.\n\nNote that we didn't need to use the fact that R is commutative in this proof, so this result actually holds for non-commutative rings as well. The set L(a) is specifically called the left annihilator of a.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

First, let's consider what happens when we square each number from 1 to p-1 modulo p.\n\n2. For any number a in this range, when we compute a\u00b2 mod p, we get some number that's a quadratic residue modulo p.\n\n3. A key insight is that for any number a between 1 and p-1, both a and -a (or equivalently, p-a) will give the same square. This is because (-a)\u00b2 = a\u00b2.\n\n4. This creates pairs of numbers that map to the same quadratic residue. For example, if we have some number x where 1 \u2264 x \u2264 (p-1)/2, then both x and p-x will square to the same value modulo p.\n\n5. Each such pair (x, p-x) is distinct because p is prime, and these pairs cover all numbers from 1 to p-1.\n\n6. Now, we can show that no two numbers in the range 1 to (p-1)/2 can square to the same value modulo p. If they did, say a\u00b2 \u2261 b\u00b2 (mod p), then p would divide (a+b)(a-b). Since p is prime and both a and b are less than p/2, this is impossible unless a = b.\n\n7. Therefore, when we square the numbers from 1 to (p-1)/2, we get (p-1)/2 distinct quadratic residues.\n\n8. Since each number from 1 to p-1 must be either a quadratic residue or a quadratic non-residue, and we've shown there are exactly (p-1)/2 quadratic residues, the remaining (p-1)/2 numbers must be quadratic non-residues.\n\nThis completes our proof, showing that the numbers from 1 to p-1 are evenly split between quadratic residues and non-residues, with (p-1)/2 of each.\nPrevious attempt failed with: type mismatch\n  Finset.range ((p - 1) / 2)\nhas type\n  Finset \u2115 : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  Finset (ZMod p) : Type\nsimp made no progress\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: type mismatch\n  Finset.range ((p - 1) / 2)\nhas type\n  Finset \u2115 : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  Finset (ZMod p) : Type\nsimp made no progress\nunsolved goals\ncase h\np : \u2115\nhp : p.Prime\n\u22a2 1 = 0\ntype mismatch\n  Finset.range ((p - 1) / 2)\nhas type\n  Finset \u2115 : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  Finset (ZMod p) : Type\nsimp made no progress\nfailed to synthesize\n  Membership (ZMod p) (Finset \u2115)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\ninvalid projection, structure expected\n  hx\nhas type\n  x ^ 2 = \u2191p\nfailed to synthesize\n  LT (ZMod p)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  HDiv \u2115 \u2115 (ZMod p)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  LT (ZMod p)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\np : \u2115\nhp : p.Prime\nx : ZMod p\nhx : x ^ 2 = \u2191p\nthis\u271d : sorryAx Prop true\nthis : sorryAx (Sort ?u.23659) true\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase h\np : \u2115\nhp : p.Prime\nx : ZMod p\nhx : x ^ 2 = \u2191p\nthis\u271d\u00b9 : sorryAx Prop true\nthis\u271d : sorryAx (Sort ?u.23659) true\nthis : sorryAx (Sort ?u.27299) true\na\u271d : x ^ 2 = \u2191p\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: type mismatch\n  Finset.range ((p - 1) / 2)\nhas type\n  Finset \u2115 : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  Finset (ZMod p) : Type\ntype mismatch\n  Finset.range ((p - 1) / 2)\nhas type\n  Finset \u2115 : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  Finset (ZMod p) : Type\nunsolved goals\np : \u2115\nhp : p.Prime\nS1 : Finset (ZMod p) := sorryAx (Finset (ZMod p)) true\nS2 : Finset (ZMod p) := sorryAx (Finset (ZMod p)) true\n\u22a2 (sorryAx (Finset (ZMod p)) true).card = (p - 1) / 2\nunsolved goals\np : \u2115\nhp : p.Prime\nS1 : Finset (ZMod p) := sorryAx (Finset (ZMod p)) true\nS2 : Finset (ZMod p) := sorryAx (Finset (ZMod p)) true\nh1 : S1.card = (p - 1) / 2\n\u22a2 (sorryAx (Finset (ZMod p)) true).card = (p - 1) / 2\nPlease revise the proof.",

This is because when we expand $(x + y)^p$ using the binomial theorem, all the intermediate terms contain binomial coefficients $\\binom{p}{k}$ for 1 \u2264 k \u2264 p-1, and these coefficients are all multiples of p.

Since this is true for every point p in U, by definition U is open.\n\nThe combination of these two directions shows that U is open if and only if none of its points are limits of its complement.\n\nThis proof reveals a fundamental connection between openness and limit points: open sets are precisely those sets that are \"separated\" from their complements in the sense that their points cannot be arbitrarily closely approached by points from outside the set.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  \ud835\udcdd[?m.570] \u2191?x\ncase mp\nM : Type u_1\ninst\u271d : TopologicalSpace M\nU : Set M\nhU : IsOpen U\nx : M\nhx : x \u2208 U\n\u22a2 \u00ac(\ud835\udcdd x \u2293 \ud835\udcdf U\u1d9c).NeBot\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  ?m.2732 \u2208 \ud835\udcdf ?m.2733\ncase mpr\nM : Type u_1\ninst\u271d : TopologicalSpace M\nU : Set M\nh : \u2200 x \u2208 U, \u00acClusterPt x (\ud835\udcdf U\u1d9c)\nx : M\nhx : x \u2208 U\n\u22a2 U \u2208 \ud835\udcdd x\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown constant 'Filter.mem_closure_iff_clusterPt'\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, equality or iff proof expected\n  ?m.570\ncase mp\nM : Type u_1\ninst\u271d : TopologicalSpace M\nU : Set M\nhU : IsOpen U\nx : M\nhx : x \u2208 U\n\u22a2 \u00ac(\ud835\udcdd x \u2293 \ud835\udcdf U\u1d9c).NeBot\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  ?m.960 \u2208 \ud835\udcdd ?m.959\ncase mpr\nM : Type u_1\ninst\u271d : TopologicalSpace M\nU : Set M\nh : \u2200 x \u2208 U, \u00acClusterPt x (\ud835\udcdf U\u1d9c)\nx : M\nhx : x \u2208 U\n\u22a2 U \u2208 \ud835\udcdd x\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown constant 'Filter.mem_closure_iff_clusterPt'\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, equality or iff proof expected\n  ?m.570\ncase mp\nM : Type u_1\ninst\u271d : TopologicalSpace M\nU : Set M\nhU : IsOpen U\nx : M\nhx : x \u2208 U\n\u22a2 \u00ac(\ud835\udcdd x \u2293 \ud835\udcdf U\u1d9c).NeBot\nunknown constant 'Filter.mem_closure_iff_clusterPt'\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, equality or iff proof expected\n  ?m.1343\ncase mpr\nM : Type u_1\ninst\u271d : TopologicalSpace M\nU : Set M\nx : M\nhx : x \u2208 U\nh : \u00ac(\ud835\udcdd x \u2293 \ud835\udcdf U\u1d9c).NeBot\n\u22a2 U \u2208 \ud835\udcdd x\nPlease revise the proof.",

We have a collection of compact sets {K\u2099} where:\n1. Each K\u2099 is nonempty\n2. Each K\u2099\u208a\u2081 is contained in K\u2099 (nested property)\n3. Each K\u2099 is compact\n\nThe key insight is that we can construct a sequence of points, one from each set, and use the compactness property to find a point in the intersection.\n\nHere's how the proof works:\n\n1. Since each K\u2099 is nonempty, we can choose a point x\u2099 from each set K\u2099.\n\n2. Now, consider K\u2081, the first set in our sequence. Since K\u2081 is compact, the sequence {x\u2099} must have a convergent subsequence (by the compactness property), let's call it {x\u2099\u2096}.\n\n3. Let's call the limit of this subsequence x*.

Since this is true for any m, x* must be in the intersection of all K\u2099.\n\nTherefore, we have found a point x* that belongs to the intersection of all sets in our sequence, proving that this intersection is nonempty.\n\nThis proof relies crucially on two properties of compact sets:\n- Every sequence in a compact set has a convergent subsequence\n- Compact sets are closed (contain their limit points)\n\nCombined with the nested property, these allow us to construct a point that must lie in all sets simultaneously.\nPrevious attempt failed with: type mismatch\n  hs\nhas type\n  \u2200 (i : \u2115), s i \u2283 s (i + 1) : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u2200 (i : \u2115), (s i).Nonempty : Prop\ntype mismatch\n  hs\nhas type\n  \u2200 (i : \u2115), s i \u2283 s (i + 1) : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u2200 (i : \u2115), IsCompact (s i) : Prop\ninvalid field notation, type is not of the form (C ...) where C is a constant\n  IsCompact\nhas type\n  Set ?m.1422 \u2192 Prop\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

Here's the reasoning:\n\nSuppose, for the sake of contradiction, that f is not constant. This would mean there exist two points a and b where f(a) \u2260 f(b).\n\nBy the given condition, we know that |f(t) - f(x)| \u2264 |t - x|\u00b2 for any two points t and x.\n\nNow, let's consider what this means for any two points that are very close together. If we take two points that are a distance h apart, where h is very small (approaching 0), then:\n|f(x + h) - f(x)| \u2264 |h|\u00b2\n\nThis means that as h gets very small, the difference in function values gets even smaller (it shrinks quadratically). In fact, the difference in function values shrinks much faster than the distance between the points.\n\nThis implies that f must be differentiable at every point, and its derivative must be 0 everywhere. Here's why:\n- The derivative at any point x would be the limit of [f(x + h) - f(x)]/h as h approaches 0\n- But we know |f(x + h) - f(x)| \u2264 |h|\u00b2\n- Therefore |[f(x + h) - f(x)]/h| \u2264 |h|\n- As h approaches 0, this means the derivative must be 0\n\nIf a function is differentiable everywhere with a derivative of 0, then it must be constant (this is a basic calculus theorem).\n\nTherefore, our initial assumption that f was not constant must be wrong. We conclude that f must be constant.\n\nThis proof shows that the quadratic bound on the difference of function values forces the function to be constant, as any non-constant behavior would violate this bound for points sufficiently close together.\nPrevious attempt failed with: linarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase a\nf : \u211d \u2192 \u211d\nhf : \u2200 (x y : \u211d), |f x - f y| \u2264 |x - y| ^ 2\nx : \u211d\nh1 : |f x - f 0| \u2264 x ^ 2\nh2 : f x \u2260 f 0\na\u271d : |f x - f 0| / |x| ^ 2 > 1\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nunknown identifier 'div_lt_one_of_pos'\ntactic 'contradiction' failed\ncase h.h\nf : \u211d \u2192 \u211d\nhf : \u2200 (x y : \u211d), |f x - f y| \u2264 |x - y| ^ 2\nx : \u211d\nh1 : |f x - f 0| \u2264 x ^ 2\nh2 : f x \u2260 f 0\nh3 : |f x - f 0| / |x| ^ 2 \u2264 1\nh4 : |f x - f 0| / |x| ^ 2 > 1\n\u22a2 False\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'div_lt_one_of_pos'\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\nf : \u211d \u2192 \u211d\nhf : \u2200 (x y : \u211d), |f x - f y| \u2264 |x - y| ^ 2\nx : \u211d\nh1 : |f x - f 0| \u2264 x ^ 2\nh2 : |f x - f 0| \u2264 x ^ 2\nh : \u00acf x = f 0\nh4 : |f x - f 0| / x ^ 2 > 1\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

It's increasing because if h\u2081 < h\u2082, then the supremum over a smaller set is less than or equal to the supremum over a larger set\n3.

In other words:\n(g,h)(g',h') = (g',h')(g,h) for all g' \u2208 G and h' \u2208 H\n\nBy the definition of multiplication in a direct product, this means:\n(gg',hh') = (g'g,h'h)\n\nFor this equality to hold, we must have:\ngg' = g'g for all g' \u2208 G\nhh' = h'h for all h' \u2208 H\n\nThis means g is in Z(G) and h is in Z(H), so (g,h) \u2208 Z(G) \u00d7 Z(H).\n\nNow let's take any element (g,h) in Z(G) \u00d7 Z(H).

To prove f is injective, we need to show that if f(x) = f(y), then x = y for any elements x and y in F.\n\nLet's start by considering any two elements x and y in F where f(x) = f(y). \nWe can subtract these equations to get: f(x) - f(y) = 0\n\nSince f is a homomorphism, it preserves addition and multiplication, so:\nf(x) - f(y) = f(x - y) = 0\n\nThis means that x - y is in the kernel of f (the set of elements that map to 0).\n\nNow, here's the key insight: in a field homomorphism, if any nonzero element were in the kernel, it would lead to a contradiction. Here's why:\n\nIf a nonzero element z were in the kernel, then f(z) = 0. Since z is nonzero and F is a field, z has a multiplicative inverse z\u207b\u00b9. By the homomorphism properties:\n- f(z)\u00b7f(z\u207b\u00b9) = f(z\u00b7z\u207b\u00b9) = f(1) = 1\n- But also f(z)\u00b7f(z\u207b\u00b9) = 0\u00b7f(z\u207b\u00b9) = 0\n\nThis would mean 0 = 1 in K, which is impossible in a field.\n\nTherefore, the kernel can only contain 0, which means x - y must be 0, so x = y.\n\nThis proves that f is injective, as any two elements mapping to the same value must be equal.\nPrevious attempt failed with: simp made no progress\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

That is, assume V = W\u2081 \u222a W\u2082 \u222a ... \u222a W\u2099 for some finite number n, where each W\u1d62 is a proper subspace of V.\n\nFirst, let's recall that any proper subspace must have smaller dimension than the whole space. Also, a key property of vector spaces is that any subspace (except for the zero subspace) contains entire lines through the origin - that is, if w is any nonzero vector in the subspace, then the entire line {cw : c \u2208 F} must be in the subspace.\n\nNow, let's pick any nonzero vector v in V. Since we assumed V is the union of these subspaces, v must be in at least one of them, say W\u1d62. But then the entire line L = {cv : c \u2208 F} through v must be contained in W\u1d62.\n\nHere's where the infinite field condition becomes crucial: Since F is infinite, this line L contains infinitely many points. However, by our assumption, L must be covered by our finite collection of subspaces. By the pigeonhole principle, at least one of our subspaces must contain infinitely many points of L.\n\nBut if a subspace contains infinitely many points of a line, it must contain the entire line (this follows from the closure properties of subspaces). Therefore, L must be entirely contained within a single subspace.\n\nThis argument works for any nonzero vector v we choose. This means that every line through the origin in V must be contained entirely within one of our finitely many subspaces.\n\nBut this is impossible: Consider two linearly independent vectors v and w. The plane they span contains infinitely many different lines through the origin (one for each slope), and by our previous argument, each of these lines must be contained entirely within one of our finitely many subspaces. Again by the pigeonhole principle, one of our subspaces must contain infinitely many of these lines, which would force it to contain the entire plane.\n\nContinuing this argument, we can show that one of our subspaces must actually be all of V, contradicting our assumption that all the subspaces were proper.\n\nTherefore, our initial assumption must be false, and V cannot be written as the union of finitely many proper subspaces.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  \u00ac?m.2718.Nonempty\nK : Type u_1\nV : Type u_2\ninst\u271d\u00b3 : Field K\ninst\u271d\u00b2 : AddCommGroup V\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : Module K V\n\u03b9 : Type u_3\ninst\u271d : Fintype \u03b9\n\u03b3 : \u03b9 \u2192 Submodule K V\nh : \u2200 (i : \u03b9), \u03b3 i \u2260 \u22a4\nh_inter : \u22c2 i, \u2191(\u03b3 i) = \u22a4\nh_empty : \u00ac\u2203 v, \u2200 (i : \u03b9), v \u2208 \u03b3 i\n\u22a2 False\nunsolved goals\ncase intro\nK : Type u_1\nV : Type u_2\ninst\u271d\u00b3 : Field K\ninst\u271d\u00b2 : AddCommGroup V\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : Module K V\n\u03b9 : Type u_3\ninst\u271d : Fintype \u03b9\n\u03b3 : \u03b9 \u2192 Submodule K V\nh : \u2200 (i : \u03b9), \u03b3 i \u2260 \u22a4\nh_inter : \u22c2 i, \u2191(\u03b3 i) = \u22a4\nv : V\nhv : \u2200 (i : \u03b9), v \u2208 \u03b3 i\nh_proper : \u2200 (i : \u03b9), \u03b3 i \u2260 \u22a4\n\u22a2 False\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: typeclass instance problem is stuck, it is often due to metavariables\n  Membership V ?m.2176\ntype mismatch\n  h_empty\nhas type\n  \u00ac\u2203 v, \u2200 (i : \u03b9), v \u2208 \u03b3 i : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  False : Prop\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: typeclass instance problem is stuck, it is often due to metavariables\n  Membership V ?m.2176\ntype mismatch\n  h_empty\nhas type\n  \u00ac\u2203 v, \u2200 (i : \u03b9), v \u2208 \u03b3 i : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  False : Prop\nPlease revise the proof.",

For any prime divisor of the group's order, there must exist a Sylow subgroup of that order's highest power.\n\nIn our case, let's assume p > q (if not, we can just swap them).

This gives us a homomorphism from G to S\u2088 (the symmetric group on 8 elements). The kernel of this homomorphism is normal in G.

For example, the x terms cancel, the x\u00b2 terms cancel, and so on. What we're left with is:\n1 + (-1)^(n-1)x^n\n\nBut remember, x^n = 0 by the nilpotent property!

By definition, this makes 1+x a unit in R.\n\nThe key insight is that the nilpotent property ensures our alternating sum terminates and gives us a finite expression for the inverse, which wouldn't be possible if x^n wasn't zero for some n.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'with'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ':='; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ':='; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

This is equal to a\u00b2 + b\u00b2, which is a positive integer since at least one of a or b is nonzero. \n\nHere's why this helps us: Since a + bi is in our ideal I, and since ideals are closed under multiplication by any Gauss integer, a - bi times a + bi must also be in I. Therefore, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 is in our ideal I.\n\nSo we've found a positive integer (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) that belongs to our ideal I. This proves that every nonzero ideal in \u2124[i] contains at least one nonzero integer.\n\nThe key insight here is that by multiplying a Gauss integer by its complex conjugate, we always get a positive integer, and the properties of ideals ensure this number must be in our ideal.\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  Exists.intro x\nargument\n  x\nhas type\n  GaussianInt : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u21a5I : Type\ntype mismatch\n  h\u271d\nhas type\n  True : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  x = 0 : Prop\nunsolved goals\ncase h.right\nI : Ideal GaussianInt\nhI : I \u2260 \u22a5\nx : \u21a5I\nhx : x \u2260 0\n\u22a2 (\u2191x).im = 0\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  Exists.intro x\nargument\n  x\nhas type\n  GaussianInt : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u21a5I : Type\nunsolved goals\ncase h.right\nI : Ideal GaussianInt\nhI : I \u2260 \u22a5\nx : \u21a5I\nhx : x \u2260 0\n\u22a2 (\u2191x).im = 0\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: rcases tactic failed: h\u271d : a = 0 \u2192 False is not an inductive datatype\nPlease revise the proof.",

This part is actually true for any ideals, regardless of whether $I + J = R$. Take any element in $IJ$. Such an element is a sum of products $ab$ where $a \\in I$ and $b \\in J$. Since $I$ is an ideal, it's closed under multiplication, so each such product $ab$ is in $I$. Similarly, since $J$ is an ideal, each product $ab$ is in $J$. Therefore, any element of $IJ$ must be in both $I$ and $J$, meaning $IJ \\subseteq I \\cap J$.\n\nNow for the more interesting part: showing that $I \\cap J \\subseteq IJ$. This is where we use the condition that $I + J = R$.\n\nSince $I + J = R$, we know that $1 = i + j$ for some $i \\in I$ and $j \\in J$. Take any element $x$ in $I \\cap J$. This means $x$ is in both $I$ and $J$.\n\nNow, let's look at $x = x \\cdot 1 = x(i + j) = xi + xj$\n\nSince $x \\in I$ and $i \\in I$, we know $xi \\in I$ (as $I$ is an ideal).\nSince $x \\in J$ and $j \\in J$, we know $xj \\in J$ (as $J$ is an ideal).\n\nTherefore, $x = xi + xj$ where $xi \\in IJ$ and $xj \\in IJ$ (since each term is a product of an element from $I$ and an element from $J$).\n\nThus, $x \\in IJ$, showing that $I \\cap J \\subseteq IJ$.\n\nCombining both directions, we conclude that $IJ = I \\cap J$.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

Here's how we can reason about this:\n\nFirst, recall that a cubic polynomial in a field is irreducible if and only if it has no roots in that field (because if it were reducible, it would have at least one linear factor, and thus a root).\n\nSo, we just need to check if x\u00b3 - 9 has any roots in F\u2083\u2081. In other words, we need to check if there exists any element a in F\u2083\u2081 such that a\u00b3 - 9 \u2261 0 (mod 31).\n\nWe can use Fermat's Little Theorem here, which tells us that for any non-zero element a in F\u2083\u2081:\na\u00b3\u2070 \u2261 1 (mod 31)\n\nThis means that the possible values for a\u00b3 in F\u2083\u2081 must be the same as the values of a when a ranges from 1 to 30.\n\nNow, 9 is a specific value in F\u2083\u2081. For x\u00b3 - 9 to have a root, we would need some value a where a\u00b3 \u2261 9 (mod 31).\n\nIn F\u2083\u2081, 9 is a cubic residue if and only if 9^((31-1)/3) \u2261 1 (mod 31)\nThat is, if and only if 9\u00b9\u2070 \u2261 1 (mod 31)\n\nWe can compute this:\n9\u00b9\u2070 \u2261 5 (mod 31) \u2262 1 (mod 31)\n\nSince 9\u00b9\u2070 \u2262 1 (mod 31), we can conclude that 9 is not a cubic residue modulo 31.\n\nTherefore, the equation x\u00b3 \u2261 9 (mod 31) has no solutions in F\u2083\u2081, which means x\u00b3 - 9 has no roots in F\u2083\u2081.\n\nThus, x\u00b3 - 9 is irreducible in F\u2083\u2081.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown constant 'ZMod.pow_card_eq_self'\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  a ^ 3\na : ZMod 31\nthis : a ^ 31 = a\nh : a ^ 3 = 9\n\u22a2 a ^ 31 = 9 ^ 10\ntype mismatch\n  this\nhas type\n  9 ^ 10 \u2260 1 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  a ^ 3 \u2260 9 : Prop\nunknown constant 'Polynomial.irreducible_of_degree_eq_three'\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'irreducible_of_degree_eq_three'\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'irreducible_of_degree_eq_three'\nPlease revise the proof.",

This means \u03b1^(q-1) = 1.\n\nIf q is even, then (q-1) is odd, and ((q-1)q)/2 has the same remainder as (q-1)/2 when divided by q-1.\nIf q is odd, then (q-1) is even, and ((q-1)q)/2 has the same remainder as (q-1)/2 when divided by q-1.\n\nIn either case, \u03b1 raised to this power equals -1.\n\nTherefore, the product of all nonzero elements in K must equal -1.\n\nThis proof works because we've shown that the product of all nonzero elements, when expressed as a power of a primitive element, must equal -1 regardless of the specific field structure, as long as the field is finite.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

This means that for any such subspace U, if v is in U, then T(v) is also in U.\n\nThe key insight is to consider what this means for eigenvectors and eigenvalues of T.\n\nLet's pick any nonzero vector v in V. Consider the span of v, which we'll call L = span{v}. The complement of L will be a subspace of dimension dim V - 1. By our assumption, this subspace must be invariant under T.\n\nNow, consider T(v). This vector must lie in either L or in the complement of L.

Since this is true for any vector v we choose, this means that every vector in V is an eigenvector of T.\n\nWhen every nonzero vector is an eigenvector, all vectors must share the same eigenvalue. This is because if we had two different eigenvalues \u03bb\u2081 and \u03bb\u2082 with corresponding eigenvectors v\u2081 and v\u2082, then any linear combination of these vectors would need to be an eigenvector too, which is impossible unless \u03bb\u2081 = \u03bb\u2082.\n\nTherefore, there exists some scalar c such that T(v) = cv for all vectors v in V.

In other words, T cannot map any nonzero vector to a scalar multiple of itself.\n\nNow, let W be any subspace of V that is invariant under T. We need to show that dim(W) is even.\n\nThe key insight is that we can view T|W (T restricted to W) as a linear operator on W. Since W is invariant under T, this restriction makes sense. Moreover, T|W also has no eigenvalues, as these would be eigenvalues of T.\n\nHere's the crucial part: when we look at the matrix representation of T|W with respect to any basis of W, this matrix must have no real eigenvalues. By a fundamental result from linear algebra, any real matrix with no real eigenvalues must have characteristic polynomial that factors into quadratic terms over the reals (since complex eigenvalues come in conjugate pairs).\n\nEach of these quadratic factors corresponds to a 2-dimensional invariant subspace of W where T acts as a rotation and scaling. The matrix of T|W can be put into block diagonal form where each block is 2\u00d72, corresponding to these rotation-scaling actions.\n\nSince the entire matrix breaks down into 2\u00d72 blocks, the dimension of W must be equal to the number of these blocks multiplied by 2.

The left side of our target inequality is (\u03a3 a\u2c7cb\u2c7c)\u00b2. \n   When we substitute our x\u2c7c and y\u2c7c:\n   a\u2c7cb\u2c7c = (x\u2c7c/\u221aj)(y\u2c7c\u00b7\u221aj) = x\u2c7cy\u2c7c\n   So the left side remains unchanged.\n\n2. For the first sum on the right side:\n   x\u2c7c\u00b2 = j\u00b7a\u2c7c\u00b2\n   So \u03a3x\u2c7c\u00b2 = \u03a3j\u00b7a\u2c7c\u00b2\n\n3. For the second sum on the right side:\n   y\u2c7c\u00b2 = b\u2c7c\u00b2/j\n   So \u03a3y\u2c7c\u00b2 = \u03a3(b\u2c7c\u00b2/j)\n\nWhen we apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality with our substitutions:\n(\u03a3 x\u2c7cy\u2c7c)\u00b2 \u2264 (\u03a3 x\u2c7c\u00b2)(\u03a3 y\u2c7c\u00b2)\n\nThis becomes exactly our target inequality:\n(\u03a3 a\u2c7cb\u2c7c)\u00b2 \u2264 (\u03a3 j\u00b7a\u2c7c\u00b2)(\u03a3 b\u2c7c\u00b2/j)\n\nSince the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality is valid for all real numbers, and our substitutions maintain the equality of both sides, our target inequality is proven.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

This proof relies on several key ideas from linear algebra and spectral theory.\n\nFirst, recall that for a normal operator T on a complex inner-product space, we can apply the Spectral Theorem. This tells us that V has an orthonormal basis consisting of eigenvectors of T. Let's call these eigenvectors {e\u2081, e\u2082, ..., e\u2099} with corresponding eigenvalues {\u03bb\u2081, \u03bb\u2082, ..., \u03bb\u2099}.\n\nSince T is normal, we can represent it as a diagonal matrix with respect to this basis, where the diagonal entries are the eigenvalues \u03bb\u1d62.\n\nTo construct a square root S of T, we need to find an operator such that S\u00b2 = T. The key insight is that we can define S to be diagonal in the same basis as T, but with eigenvalues that are square roots of T's eigenvalues.\n\nFor each eigenvalue \u03bb\u1d62 of T, we can take its complex square root. For any complex number z, we can always find a complex number w such that w\u00b2 = z. Specifically, if we write \u03bb\u1d62 in polar form as r\u2219e^(i\u03b8), its square root can be written as \u221ar\u2219e^(i\u03b8/2).\n\nNow we can define our operator S by keeping the same eigenvectors as T but using these square roots as eigenvalues. That is, if v is an eigenvector of T with eigenvalue \u03bb, then we make it an eigenvector of S with eigenvalue \u221a\u03bb.\n\nThis construction ensures that S is well-defined (since we can find square roots for all complex numbers), and it's straightforward to verify that S\u00b2 = T. When S acts twice on any eigenvector, it multiplies it by \u221a\u03bb twice, giving us \u03bb, which is exactly what T does.\n\nFurthermore, since we constructed S using the same eigenvectors as T, and since these eigenvectors form an orthonormal basis, S is also a normal operator.\n\nTherefore, we have constructed a square root S for any normal operator T, proving that every normal operator on a complex inner-product space has a square root.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'let'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'let'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'let'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

These elements are actually conjugates of each other, because:\nba = (b)(a)(b^(-1))(b) = b(ab)b^(-1)\n\nA fundamental property of conjugate elements is that they always have the same order.

To prove it's infinite, I'll show we can construct infinitely many different permutations.\n\nHere's the key idea: Consider the following type of permutation - one that swaps just two numbers and leaves all others fixed. For any two distinct positive integers a and b, we can define a permutation that swaps a and b while keeping all other numbers unchanged. Let's call such a permutation a transposition.\n\nNow, let's construct an infinite family of different permutations:\n- Consider the permutation that swaps 1 and 2 (leaving all else fixed)\n- Consider the permutation that swaps 1 and 3 (leaving all else fixed)\n- Consider the permutation that swaps 1 and 4 (leaving all else fixed)\nAnd so on...\n\nEach of these permutations is different from all the others because:\n1. Each sends 1 to a different number\n2. They all affect different pairs of numbers\n3. Each is a distinct bijective function\n\nSince we can construct such a permutation for every positive integer (swapping 1 with that integer), and there are infinitely many positive integers, we have constructed an infinite family of distinct permutations.\n\nTherefore, S_\u03a9 contains infinitely many elements, making it an infinite group.

Consider two elements (a\u2081,b\u2081) and (a\u2082,b\u2082) in A \u00d7 B. In A \u00d7 B, their product is (a\u2081a\u2082,b\u2081b\u2082). When we apply f to this product, we get f((a\u2081a\u2082,b\u2081b\u2082)) = (b\u2081b\u2082,a\u2081a\u2082).\n\nOn the other hand, if we first apply f to each element and then multiply in B \u00d7 A, we get f((a\u2081,b\u2081)) \u00d7 f((a\u2082,b\u2082)) = (b\u2081,a\u2081) \u00d7 (b\u2082,a\u2082) = (b\u2081b\u2082,a\u2081a\u2082).\n\nSince these results are equal, f preserves the group operation and is thus a homomorphism.\n\nNext, f is clearly bijective because:\n1. It's injective: if f((a\u2081,b\u2081)) = f((a\u2082,b\u2082)), then (b\u2081,a\u2081) = (b\u2082,a\u2082), which means b\u2081 = b\u2082 and a\u2081 = a\u2082, so (a\u2081,b\u2081) = (a\u2082,b\u2082).\n2.

Here's the reasoning:\n\nFirst, let's consider what we know about \u03c3:\n1. The only fixed point of \u03c3 is the identity element (if \u03c3(g) = g, then g = 1)\n2. \u03c3\u00b2 is the identity map, meaning \u03c3(\u03c3(g)) = g for all g in G\n\nNow, let's take any two elements a and b in G. We'll show that ab = ba.\n\nConsider the element ab(\u03c3(a))(\u03c3(b)). We can show this equals the identity element in two different ways:\n\nFirst way:\n- Replace \u03c3(a) with a\u207b\u00b9 (this works because \u03c3\u00b2(a) = a means \u03c3(a) and a are inverses)\n- Similarly replace \u03c3(b) with b\u207b\u00b9\n- This gives us ab(a\u207b\u00b9)(b\u207b\u00b9) = 1\n\nSecond way:\n- Since \u03c3 is an automorphism, \u03c3(ab) = \u03c3(a)\u03c3(b)\n- Therefore \u03c3(ab(\u03c3(a))(\u03c3(b))) = \u03c3(ab)\u03c3(\u03c3(a))\u03c3(\u03c3(b)) = \u03c3(ab)ab\n- But since this element must equal its own image under \u03c3 (as \u03c3\u00b2 is identity), and the only such element is the identity, we have ab(\u03c3(a))(\u03c3(b)) = 1\n\nTherefore, ab(a\u207b\u00b9)(b\u207b\u00b9) = 1\n\nMultiply both sides on the left by b and on the right by a:\n- b(ab(a\u207b\u00b9)(b\u207b\u00b9))a = ba\n\nBut also:\n- b(1)a = ba\n\nTherefore, ba = ab\n\nSince a and b were arbitrary elements of G, this shows that any two elements commute, making G abelian.\n\nThe key insight is that the special properties of \u03c3 force elements to commute when we carefully manipulate expressions involving elements and their images under \u03c3.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unsolved goals\nG : Type u_1\ninst\u271d : Group G\n\u03c3 : MulAut G\nhs : \u2200 (g : G), \u03c3 g = 1 \u2192 g = 1\nhs2 : \u2200 (g : G), \u03c3 (\u03c3 g) = g\nx y : G\nh1 : \u03c3 (x * y) = \u03c3 x * \u03c3 y\nh2 : \u03c3 (\u03c3 (x * y)) = x * y\n\u22a2 x * y = \u03c3 (x * y)\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  \u03c3 (\u03c3 (x * y))\nG : Type u_1\ninst\u271d : Group G\n\u03c3 : MulAut G\nhs : \u2200 (g : G), \u03c3 g = 1 \u2192 g = 1\nhs2 : \u2200 (g : G), \u03c3 (\u03c3 g) = g\nx y : G\nh1 : \u03c3 (x * y) = \u03c3 x * \u03c3 y\nh2 : \u03c3 (\u03c3 (x * y)) = x * y\nh3 : \u03c3 (\u03c3 (\u03c3 x * \u03c3 y)) = \u03c3 (\u03c3 x * \u03c3 y)\n\u22a2 \u03c3 x * \u03c3 y = \u03c3 y * \u03c3 x\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  \u03c3 x * \u03c3 y\nG : Type u_1\ninst\u271d : Group G\n\u03c3 : MulAut G\nhs : \u2200 (g : G), \u03c3 g = 1 \u2192 g = 1\nhs2 : \u2200 (g : G), \u03c3 (\u03c3 g) = g\nx y : G\nh1 : \u03c3 (x * y) = \u03c3 x * \u03c3 y\nh2 : \u03c3 (\u03c3 (x * y)) = x * y\nh3 : \u03c3 (\u03c3 x * \u03c3 y) = \u03c3 x * \u03c3 y\nh4 : \u03c3 x * \u03c3 y = \u03c3 y * \u03c3 x\n\u22a2 x * y = y * x\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unsolved goals\nG : Type u_1\ninst\u271d : Group G\n\u03c3 : MulAut G\nhs : \u2200 (g : G), \u03c3 g = 1 \u2192 g = 1\nhs2 : \u2200 (g : G), \u03c3 (\u03c3 g) = g\nx y : G\nh1 : \u03c3 (x * y) = \u03c3 x * \u03c3 y\nh2 : \u03c3 (\u03c3 (x * y)) = x * y\n\u22a2 x * y = \u03c3 x * \u03c3 y\nunknown identifier 'eq_of_inv_eq_inv'\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  \u03c3 x * \u03c3 y\nG : Type u_1\ninst\u271d : Group G\n\u03c3 : MulAut G\nhs : \u2200 (g : G), \u03c3 g = 1 \u2192 g = 1\nhs2 : \u2200 (g : G), \u03c3 (\u03c3 g) = g\nx y : G\nh1 : \u03c3 (x * y) = \u03c3 x * \u03c3 y\nh2 : \u03c3 (\u03c3 (x * y)) = x * y\nh3 : \u03c3 (\u03c3 x * \u03c3 y) = \u03c3 x * \u03c3 y\nh4 : \u03c3 x * \u03c3 y = \u03c3 y * \u03c3 x\n\u22a2 x * y = y * x\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

This means H contains at least one nonzero rational number - let's call it a. Since H is a subgroup, it must contain -a as well.\n\nHere's the key insight: if a is in H, then 1/a is in H (by the given property). Since H is a subgroup, we can add these elements. So if a and 1/a are in H, then a + 1/a is in H.\n\nFurthermore, we can multiply these elements by any integer (because in an additive group, we can add an element to itself any number of times). So for any integer n, both na and n(1/a) = n/a are in H.\n\nThis means H contains both all integer multiples of a and all integer multiples of 1/a. By taking appropriate combinations of these elements through addition (which is allowed since H is a subgroup), we can generate any rational number.\n\nHere's why: Any rational number can be written as p/q where p and q are integers. We can obtain this by taking p times 1/q, which we can construct in H using our previous observations.\n\nTherefore, if H contains any nonzero rational number, it must contain all rational numbers, meaning H = \u211a.\n\nThis leaves us with only two possibilities: either H = {0} (if H contains no nonzero elements) or H = \u211a (if H contains any nonzero element).\n\nThus, we have proved that H must equal either {0} or \u211a.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ':'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'exact'\nunsolved goals\nH : AddSubgroup \u211a\nx\u271d\u00b9 : \u211a\nhH : x\u271d\u00b9 \u2208 H \u2192 1 / x\u271d\u00b9 \u2208 H\nh : H \u2260 \u22a5\nx : \u211a\nx\u271d : x \u2208 \u22a4\nhx : x = 0\n\u22a2 0 \u2208 H\ntype mismatch\n  hH ?m.2034\nhas type\n  1 / x\u271d\u00b9 \u2208 H : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  1 / x \u2208 H : Prop\nsimp made no progress\ntype mismatch\n  hH ?m.2687\nhas type\n  1 / x\u271d\u00b9 \u2208 H : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  1 / x \u2208 H : Prop\nsimp made no progress\ninvalid field 'inv_mem', the environment does not contain 'AddSubgroup.inv_mem'\n  H\nhas type\n  AddSubgroup \u211a\ninvalid field 'inv_mem', the environment does not contain 'AddSubgroup.inv_mem'\n  H\nhas type\n  AddSubgroup \u211a\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: type mismatch\n  hH ?m.2544\nhas type\n  1 / x\u271d \u2208 H : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  1 / x \u2208 H : Prop\ntactic 'introN' failed, insufficient number of binders\nH : AddSubgroup \u211a\nx\u271d : \u211a\nhH : x\u271d \u2208 H \u2192 1 / x\u271d \u2208 H\nh : \u00acH = \u22a5\nx : \u211a\na\u271d : x \u2208 \u22a4\nhx : \u00acx = 0\n\u22a2 x\u271d \u2208 H\ninvalid field 'mul_mem', the environment does not contain 'AddSubgroup.mul_mem'\n  H\nhas type\n  AddSubgroup \u211a\ninvalid field 'one_mem', the environment does not contain 'AddSubgroup.one_mem'\n  H\nhas type\n  AddSubgroup \u211a\nPlease revise the proof.",

Here's the reasoning:\n\nStart with our proper subgroup H of the finite group G. If H itself is maximal, we're done. If not, then by definition there must exist some larger subgroup H\u2081 that contains H but is still smaller than G.\n\nNow, if H\u2081 is maximal, we're done.

Why? Because each subgroup in our chain is strictly larger than the previous one (in terms of number of elements), and we can't have more steps in our chain than there are elements in G.\n\nTherefore, this process must terminate. The only way it can terminate is when we reach a subgroup M that is maximal - meaning we can't find a larger proper subgroup containing it.\n\nThis subgroup M contains our original subgroup H (through the chain we constructed) and must be maximal by construction, as we couldn't extend the chain any further before reaching G.\n\nThus, we've shown that there must exist a maximal subgroup M containing our original subgroup H.

Since H is maximal, there can't be any subgroup strictly between H and G. In terms of divisors, this means there can't be any number strictly between d and n in the divisor lattice of n. The only way this can happen is if n/d is prime. Let's call this prime p. Then d = n/p, which means H = \u27e8x^p\u27e9.\n\n(\u21d0) Now let's prove that if H = \u27e8x^p\u27e9 for some prime p dividing n, then H is maximal.\n\nWhen H = \u27e8x^p\u27e9 where p is prime and divides n, the order of H is n/p. Consider any subgroup K that properly contains H. By the subgroup correspondence in cyclic groups, K must be of the form \u27e8x^k\u27e9 where k divides p. Since p is prime, the only divisor of p smaller than p is 1. Therefore, K must equal \u27e8x^1\u27e9 = G.

This means gH = H, which implies g \u2208 H.\n\nTherefore, K is our desired normal subgroup: it's normal in G, contained in H, and has index at most n! in G.\n\nThis completes our proof by explicitly constructing a normal subgroup K with all the required properties.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'let'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'let'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'let'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "# Informal Proof:\n\nLet me explain why any subgroup with index p in such a group G must be normal. Here's the reasoning:\n\nFirst, let's consider what we know. We have a group G whose order is p^\u03b1 where p is prime, and we're looking at a subgroup H whose index is p. This means that |G|/|H| = p.\n\nSince |G| = p^\u03b1 and [G:H] = p, we can deduce that |H| = p^(\u03b1-1). Both the order of G and H are powers of the same prime p.\n\nNow, here's the key insight: when H is a subgroup of G, G acts on the left cosets of H by left multiplication. This gives us a homomorphism from G to the permutation group of these cosets.\n\nSince [G:H] = p, there are exactly p cosets of H in G. This means G is acting on a set of p elements through this homomorphism. The image of G under this action must be a subgroup of the symmetric group S_p.\n\nHere's where the primality of p becomes crucial: by Lagrange's theorem, the order of the image of G in S_p must divide both |G| = p^\u03b1 and |S_p| = p!\n\nBut p^\u03b1 only shares the prime factor p with p!, and since we're mapping onto a group that permutes p elements, the image must have order either 1 or p (as these are the only possibilities that could divide both numbers).\n\nIf the image has order 1, then all elements of G act trivially on the cosets, meaning H is normal. If the image has order p, then by Cauchy's theorem, the image would contain an element of order p. However, in S_p, the only elements of order p are p-cycles, and a group generated by a p-cycle acts transitively. This would contradict the fact that H must be preserved under the action.\n\nTherefore, the image must have order 1, which means all elements of G fix all cosets of H. This is equivalent to saying that H is normal in G.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  Fintype \u21a5H\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  Fintype (G \u29f8 H)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  Nat.card (G \u29f8 H) * Nat.card \u21a5H\nG : Type u_1\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : Fintype G\ninst\u271d : Group G\np \u03b1 : \u2115\nhp : p.Prime\nha : \u03b1 > 0\nhG : card G = p ^ \u03b1\nH : Subgroup G\nhH : H.index = p\nthis\u271d\u00b9 : Fintype G\nthis\u271d : Fintype \u21a5H\nthis : Fintype (G \u29f8 H)\n\u22a2 H.Normal\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'QuotientGroup.quotientEquivOfIndex'\nunsolved goals\nG : Type u_1\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : Fintype G\ninst\u271d : Group G\np \u03b1 : \u2115\nhp : p.Prime\nha : \u03b1 > 0\nhG : card G = p ^ \u03b1\nH : Subgroup G\nhH : H.index = p\n\u22a2 H.Normal\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  Fintype \u21a5H\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  Fintype (G \u29f8 H)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  card ?m.10636\nG : Type u_1\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : Fintype G\ninst\u271d : Group G\np \u03b1 : \u2115\nhp : p.Prime\nha : \u03b1 > 0\nhG : card G = p ^ \u03b1\nH : Subgroup G\nhH : H.index = p\nthis\u271d\u00b9 : Fintype G\nthis\u271d : Fintype \u21a5H\nthis : Fintype (G \u29f8 H)\n\u22a2 H.Normal\nPlease revise the proof.",

Here's the reasoning:\n\nFirst, let's consider the structure of G. By Cauchy's theorem, since p divides |G|, there must exist an element a of order p in G. Similarly, there must exist an element b of order q in G.\n\nNow, let's consider the subgroup generated by a, call it <a>, and the subgroup generated by b, call it <b>. We know that |<a>| = p and |<b>| = q.\n\nA key insight is that these subgroups <a> and <b> must intersect trivially (their intersection contains only the identity element). This is because any element in their intersection would have an order that divides both p and q. Since p and q are distinct primes, the only such number is 1.\n\nSince G is abelian, we know that ab = ba. This means that the element ab generates a subgroup whose order must divide pq. Moreover, the order of ab must be the least common multiple of the orders of a and b. Since a and b have coprime orders (p and q), the order of ab must be exactly pq.\n\nTherefore, ab is an element that generates the entire group G, making G cyclic.\n\nThis proof relies crucially on both the fact that G is abelian (which ensures ab = ba) and that p and q are distinct primes (which ensures the subgroups intersect trivially and that the order of ab is pq).\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

This group has four elements and can be written as {(0,0), (1,0), (0,1), (1,1)}.\n\nFirst, let's look at the subgroups of G. The subgroups H1 = {(0,0), (1,0)}, H2 = {(0,0), (0,1)}, and H3 = {(0,0), (1,1)} are all subgroups of order 2.\n\nNow, let's focus on H1 = {(0,0), (1,0)}. I claim that H1 is normal but not characteristic.\n\nTo show H1 is normal, note that G is abelian (since it's a direct product of abelian groups), and all subgroups of abelian groups are normal.\n\nHowever, H1 is not characteristic because there exists an automorphism of G that does not map H1 to itself. Specifically, consider the automorphism \u03c6 that swaps the two coordinates:\n\u03c6((a,b)) = (b,a)\n\nWhen we apply \u03c6 to H1 = {(0,0), (1,0)}, we get:\n\u03c6(H1) = {\u03c6((0,0)), \u03c6((1,0))} = {(0,0), (0,1)} = H2\n\nSince this automorphism maps H1 to H2 (a different subgroup), H1 is not characteristic.\n\nTherefore, H1 is a normal subgroup that is not characteristic, proving that such subgroups exist.\nPrevious attempt failed with: ambiguous pattern, use fully qualified name, possible interpretations [Z2.zero, @Polynomial.zero]\nThe rfl tactic failed.

This intersection is clearly a p-subgroup of H since it's contained in P (which is a p-group) and it's also contained in H.\n\nTo show that P \u2229 H is a Sylow p-subgroup of H, we need to prove it's maximal among p-subgroups of H.

This contradicts the fact that P contains all p-subgroups of G (since P is a normal Sylow p-subgroup). Therefore, P \u2229 H must be a Sylow p-subgroup of H.\n\nFor uniqueness, suppose R is any Sylow p-subgroup of H.

Let's look at q(x) = b\u2098x\u1d50 + b\u2098\u208b\u2081x\u1d50\u207b\u00b9 + ... + b\u2081x + b\u2080, where at least one b\u1d62 is nonzero.\n\nWhen we multiply p(x) and q(x), the result must be the zero polynomial. Looking at the terms of this multiplication, we can see that the coefficient of the highest degree term (degree m+n) must be a\u2099b\u2098 = 0. Similarly, all other terms must have coefficients that sum to zero.\n\nNow, let's take b to be any nonzero coefficient b\u1d62 from q(x). When we multiply bp(x), this is equivalent to multiplying each coefficient of p(x) by b. Since p(x)q(x) = 0, and q(x) is a linear combination of terms including b, we must have bp(x) = 0. Otherwise, p(x)q(x) couldn't be zero.\n\nFor the reverse direction, let's prove that if there exists a nonzero b \u2208 R such that bp(x) = 0, then p(x) is a zero divisor in R[x].\n\nThis direction is straightforward: if bp(x) = 0 for some nonzero b \u2208 R, then we can consider the constant polynomial b as our other factor. Since b is nonzero and bp(x) = 0, p(x) is by definition a zero divisor in R[x], as we've found a nonzero polynomial (namely, the constant polynomial b) that multiplies with p(x) to give zero.\n\nTherefore, we've shown that p(x) is a zero divisor in R[x] if and only if there exists a nonzero b \u2208 R such that bp(x) = 0.\n\nThis proof reveals an interesting connection between zero divisors in polynomial rings and zero divisors in the base ring R, as the zero divisor property of a polynomial can be characterized by the existence of a single element in the base ring that annihilates it.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

When we apply \u03c6 to both sides of the equation xr = rx, we get:\n- \u03c6(xr) = \u03c6(rx)\n- Because \u03c6 is a homomorphism, \u03c6(xr) = \u03c6(x)\u03c6(r) and \u03c6(rx) = \u03c6(r)\u03c6(x)\n- Therefore, \u03c6(x)\u03c6(r) = \u03c6(r)\u03c6(x)\n- Remember that \u03c6(r) = s\n- So, \u03c6(x)s = s\u03c6(x)\n\nThis shows that \u03c6(x) commutes with any arbitrary element s in S, which is exactly what we needed to prove that \u03c6(x) is in the center of S.\n\nSince this works for any x in the center of R, we've proven that the image of the center of R is contained in the center of S.\nPrevious attempt failed with: type mismatch\n  image_subset_iff.mpr ?m.1269\nhas type\n  ?m.1264 '' ?m.1262 \u2286 ?m.1263 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u21d1\u03c6 '' Set.center R \u2282 Set.center S : Prop\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown constant 'Set.ssubset_of_subset_ne'\nno goals to be solved\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown constant 'Set.ssubset_of_subset_ne'\nno goals to be solved\nPlease revise the proof.",

So there exists some positive integer n where a^n = 0.\n\nThe key insight is that we can factor 1-(ab) out of a geometric-like series. Let's look at:\n1 + (ab) + (ab)^2 + ... + (ab)^(n-1)\n\nIf we multiply this sum by (1-ab), we get:\n(1-ab)(1 + ab + (ab)^2 + ... + (ab)^(n-1)) = 1 - (ab)^n\n\nNow, since a is nilpotent and a^n = 0, we can look at (ab)^n:\n(ab)^n = a^n * b^n = 0 * b^n = 0\n\nTherefore:\n(1-ab)(1 + ab + (ab)^2 + ... + (ab)^(n-1)) = 1 - 0 = 1\n\nThis shows that 1-ab has a multiplicative inverse, namely (1 + ab + (ab)^2 + ... + (ab)^(n-1)).

Here's how we'll do this:\n\nFirst, let's consider any ideal I in R. If I = {0}, then I is principal (generated by 0), so we're done. If I is non-zero, let's show it must be principal.\n\nTake any non-zero element a\u2081 in I. If I = (a\u2081), we're done. If not, there must be some element a\u2082 in I that isn't generated by a\u2081. In this case, a\u2082 must divide a\u2081 (because any element in I that divides a\u2081 must generate a smaller ideal within I).\n\nWe can continue this process: if I \u2260 (a\u2082), we can find a\u2083 in I that divides a\u2082, and so on. This gives us a sequence of elements a\u2081, a\u2082, a\u2083, ... where each element divides the previous one.\n\nBy condition (ii), this sequence must stabilize - there must be some N where for all n \u2265 N, a\u2099 differs from a\u2099 only by a unit factor. This means (a\u2099) = (a\u2098) for all n, m \u2265 N.\n\nNow, let's show that I = (a\u2099). We know (a\u2099) \u2286 I since a\u2099 \u2208 I. For the reverse inclusion, take any element b \u2208 I. By condition (i), b and a\u2099 have a greatest common divisor d that can be written as d = rb + sa\u2099 for some r, s \u2208 R.\n\nSince b and a\u2099 are both in I, d must also be in I. But d divides a\u2099, and we chose a\u2099 such that any divisor of it in I must generate the same ideal. Therefore, d must differ from a\u2099 by only a unit factor.\n\nThis means a\u2099 divides b (since d divides b and a\u2099 differs from d by only a unit). Therefore b \u2208 (a\u2099), proving I \u2286 (a\u2099).\n\nThus, I = (a\u2099), showing that I is principal. Since this works for any ideal I, R must be a Principal Ideal Domain.\n\nThe key insight is that condition (ii) prevents infinite descending chains of proper divisors, while condition (i) ensures we can relate any element to our generating element via the greatest common divisor property. Together, these force every ideal to be principal.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

Here's how we can do this:\n\nFirst, let's understand what this ring looks like. We're starting with the polynomial ring in infinitely many variables (x\u2081, x\u2082, x\u2083, ...), and we're quotienting out by the ideal generated by products of consecutive pairs of variables (x\u2081x\u2082, x\u2083x\u2084, x\u2085x\u2086, ...).\n\nFor any positive odd integer n, consider the ideal P_n generated by the variable x_n in our quotient ring. I claim that each such P_n is a minimal prime ideal, and they are all distinct.\n\nHere's why P_n is prime:\n1. In our quotient ring, if we look at the product x_n\u00b7x_{n+1}, it equals zero (as it's in our quotient ideal).\n2. Therefore, if a product of elements is in P_n, one of the factors must be in P_n (this is a key property of prime ideals).\n\nTo show P_n is minimal:\n1. If Q were a prime ideal properly contained in P_n, it would have to be (0).\n2. But P_n cannot contain (0) properly because x_n\u00b7x_{n+1} = 0 in our ring, and x_{n+1} is not in P_n.\n3. This means x_n is a zero divisor modulo any prime ideal contained in P_n.\n4. Therefore, P_n must be minimal.\n\nThe ideals are distinct because each P_n contains a different variable x_n that is not in any other P_m for m \u2260 n.\n\nSince we can construct such an ideal P_n for every odd positive integer n, and they are all distinct minimal prime ideals, we have proven that there are infinitely many minimal prime ideals in our ring.\n\nThis construction works because our quotient relations (x\u2081x\u2082 = 0, x\u2083x\u2084 = 0, etc.) create a very specific structure where each odd-indexed variable generates a minimal prime ideal, and these ideals cannot be compared to each other under inclusion.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'let'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

So N(b)N(d) = 2.\n\nSince 2 is prime in \u2124 and the norm is multiplicative, this means one of N(b) or N(d) would have to be \u00b11 and the other \u00b12. However, it's impossible for any element of \u2124[\u221a2] to have a norm of \u00b12 (you can verify this by considering p\u00b2 - 2q\u00b2 = \u00b12 has no integer solutions).\n\nThis contradiction shows that our initial assumption must be false, and therefore x\u00b2-\u221a2 must be irreducible over \u2124[\u221a2].\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

Here's how we can prove this:\n\nFirst, let's understand what we're trying to prove. We need to show that there exists a linear bijection between \u211d\u207f and \u211d when both are considered as vector spaces over \u211a.\n\nThe key insight is that both \u211d\u207f and \u211d have the same dimension as vector spaces over \u211a - they are both uncountably infinite dimensional! Here's why:\n\n1) Consider \u211d as a vector space over \u211a. We can show that any transcendental number (like \u03c0, e, etc.) along with all of its rational multiples forms a linearly independent set over \u211a. Since there are uncountably many transcendental numbers, \u211d has an uncountable basis over \u211a.\n\n2) Similarly, in \u211d\u207f, if we take any transcendental number t, the vectors (t,0,0,...,0), (0,t,0,...,0), etc., are linearly independent over \u211a. Again, we can construct an uncountable basis.\n\n3) Both spaces have bases of the same cardinality (specifically, the cardinality of the continuum).\n\n4) A fundamental theorem of vector spaces states that any two vector spaces over the same field are isomorphic if and only if they have bases of the same cardinality.\n\nTherefore, since both \u211d\u207f and \u211d have bases of the same cardinality when viewed as vector spaces over \u211a, they must be isomorphic.\n\nThis proof shows why the result is true without getting into the technical details of constructing a specific isomorphism, which would be quite complicated. The key is recognizing that the dimension of these spaces over \u211a is much larger than their dimension over \u211d, and in fact, they both have the same uncountable dimension.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unexpected end of input\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unexpected end of input\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: \nPlease revise the proof.",

Show it's the largest such topology\n\nFor the first point, let's verify the topology axioms:\n- The empty set and whole space $X$ must be in $\\mathcal{T}$. Since these are in every topology $\\mathcal{T}_\\alpha$, they must be in their intersection.\n- For any collection of sets in $\\mathcal{T}$, their union must be in $\\mathcal{T}$. If we take sets from $\\mathcal{T}$, they're in every $\\mathcal{T}_\\alpha$. Since each $\\mathcal{T}_\\alpha$ is a topology, the union of these sets is in each $\\mathcal{T}_\\alpha$. Therefore, this union is in their intersection $\\mathcal{T}$.\n- Similarly, for any finite collection of sets in $\\mathcal{T}$, their intersection is in $\\mathcal{T}$ by the same reasoning.\n\nThe second point is immediate from the construction: since $\\mathcal{T}$ is the intersection of all $\\mathcal{T}_\\alpha$, it must be contained in each one.\n\nFor the third point, suppose there was another topology $\\mathcal{S}$ contained in all $\\mathcal{T}_\\alpha$. Then $\\mathcal{S}$ must be contained in their intersection $\\mathcal{T}$. This proves $\\mathcal{T}$ is the largest such topology.\n\nUniqueness follows because if there were two such largest topologies, each would have to be contained in the other (since each is contained in all $\\mathcal{T}_\\alpha$), making them equal.\n\nTherefore, $\\mathcal{T}$ is the unique largest topology contained in all $\\mathcal{T}_\\alpha$.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token '\u22c2'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token '\u22c2'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token '\u22c2'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

Given any open set in the standard topology and any point in it, we can find one of our rational-endpoint intervals that contains the point and is contained in the open set.\n\nFor the first property, take any real number x. We can always find rational numbers a and b such that a < x < b (this is because the rationals are dense in the reals). Therefore, x belongs to the interval (a,b), which is in our collection. This shows that these intervals cover \u211d.\n\nFor the second property, take any open set U in the standard topology and any point x in U. Since U is open, there exists some \u03b5 > 0 such that the interval (x-\u03b5, x+\u03b5) is contained in U. Now, because the rationals are dense in the reals, we can find:\n- a rational number a between x-\u03b5 and x\n- a rational number b between x and x+\u03b5\n\nThis gives us a rational-endpoint interval (a,b) that contains x and is contained in (x-\u03b5, x+\u03b5), which is itself contained in U.\n\nTherefore, our collection satisfies both requirements of a basis.

Directly from X: Open sets are of the form A \u2229 U, where U is open in X\n2. Through Y: Open sets are of the form A \u2229 V, where V is open in Y\n\nNow, since Y is a subspace of X, any open set V in Y is itself of the form Y \u2229 U where U is open in X.\n\nSo when we get an open set in A through Y, it looks like:\nA \u2229 V = A \u2229 (Y \u2229 U) = (A \u2229 Y) \u2229 U\n\nBut since A is a subset of Y, we know that A \u2229 Y = A.

Therefore, (x, y) lies in the open rectangle (a, b) \u00d7 (c, d), which is an element of our collection.\n\nNext, let's show the intersection property.

Let's call this complement set B.\n\nFor any point p in B, we know that f(p) > g(p). In an ordered set Y, if we have two points y\u2081 > y\u2082, we can find an open interval (c,d) that contains y\u2081 but not y\u2082. This is a fundamental property of the order topology.\n\nSo, for our point p, we can find some c and d in Y such that f(p) is in the open interval (c,d), and this entire interval lies strictly above g(p).\n\nNow, since f is continuous, the preimage of (c,d) under f is open in X.

This means that both g\u2081 and g\u2082 agree with f on A - that is, g\u2081(x) = f(x) = g\u2082(x) for all x in A.\n\nNow, let's consider any point p in \u0100. By the definition of closure, we can find a sequence of points {x\u2099} from A that converges to p. Since both g\u2081 and g\u2082 are continuous, we know that:\n- g\u2081(x\u2099) must converge to g\u2081(p)\n- g\u2082(x\u2099) must converge to g\u2082(p)\n\nBut remember, for each x\u2099 in the sequence (which are all in A), we have g\u2081(x\u2099) = f(x\u2099) = g\u2082(x\u2099).

For any fixed x between 0 and 1:\n- If x = 0, then fn(0) = 0 for all n\n- If x = 1, then fn(1) = 1 for all n\n- If 0 < x < 1, then x\u207f approaches 0 as n approaches infinity\n\nThis tells us that the pointwise limit function f(x) is:\nf(x) = 0 for 0 \u2264 x < 1\nf(x) = 1 for x = 1\n\nTo disprove uniform convergence, I'll show that we can always find points where the convergence is arbitrarily slow, no matter how large n gets.\n\nConsider x = 1 - 1/n for any large n.

This violates the definition of uniform convergence, which requires that we can make the difference between fn and the limit function arbitrarily small everywhere simultaneously.\n\nTherefore, the sequence (fn) cannot converge uniformly on [0,1].",

Given any point y in Y, we can apply f to get a point f(y) in X. Then p(f(y)) = y because p \u2218 f is the identity map on Y. This immediately shows that p is surjective since every point in Y has a preimage.\n\nNow for the key part: we need to show that U is open in Y if and only if p\u207b\u00b9(U) is open in X.\n\nOne direction is easy: if U is open in Y, then p\u207b\u00b9(U) must be open in X because p is continuous. This is true for any continuous map.\n\nFor the other direction, suppose p\u207b\u00b9(U) is open in X. We need to show U is open in Y. Here's where we use f:\n\nTake any point y in U. Consider f(y) in X. Since p(f(y)) = y (as p \u2218 f is identity), we know f(y) must be in p\u207b\u00b9(U). Since p\u207b\u00b9(U) is open and f is continuous, f\u207b\u00b9(p\u207b\u00b9(U)) must be open in Y.\n\nNow, f\u207b\u00b9(p\u207b\u00b9(U)) is actually equal to U. Why? Because for any y in Y:\n- y is in f\u207b\u00b9(p\u207b\u00b9(U)) if and only if f(y) is in p\u207b\u00b9(U)\n- f(y) is in p\u207b\u00b9(U) if and only if p(f(y)) is in U\n- p(f(y)) = y (since p \u2218 f is identity)\n- therefore y is in f\u207b\u00b9(p\u207b\u00b9(U)) if and only if y is in U\n\nThus U = f\u207b\u00b9(p\u207b\u00b9(U)), which is open in Y. This shows that if p\u207b\u00b9(U) is open in X, then U is open in Y.\n\nHaving proven both directions, we've shown that U is open in Y if and only if p\u207b\u00b9(U) is open in X.

Here's how we can think about this:\n\nFirst, let's be clear about what we're trying to prove. We have an open map p from X to Y, and we're looking at its restriction q to some open set A in X. We need to show that q is also an open map, which means we need to prove that q takes open sets in A to open sets in p(A).\n\nLet's take any open set U in A. To show q is open, we need to prove that q(U) is open in p(A).\n\nHere's the key insight: since U is open in A and A is open in X, U must also be open in X. This follows from a basic property of topology - the intersection of two open sets is open, and U can be viewed as the intersection of some open set in X with A.\n\nNow, since p is an open map and U is open in X, we know that p(U) is open in Y. \n\nBut q(U) is just p(U) intersected with p(A). More precisely, q(U) = p(U) \u2229 p(A).\n\nSince p(U) is open in Y, its intersection with any subset of Y (in this case p(A)) will be open in that subset under the subspace topology.

Let's say A lies in U.\n\nSimilarly, for any $A_{\\alpha}$, since it's connected, it must also lie entirely within either U or V. Here's where the key condition comes in: we know that A intersects each $A_{\\alpha}$. Since A lies in U, and each $A_{\\alpha}$ intersects A, each $A_{\\alpha}$ must also lie entirely in U. If any $A_{\\alpha}$ were to lie in V, it would contradict either the fact that U and V are disjoint or that $A_{\\alpha}$ intersects A.\n\nBut this means that V is empty, as everything in our space $A \\cup(\\bigcup A_{\\alpha})$ must lie in U.

What we're looking for is a point where this difference is zero, as that would mean f(x) = x.\n\nLet's look at what happens at the endpoints of [0,1]:\n- At x = 0: g(0) = f(0) - 0 = f(0)\n- At x = 1: g(1) = f(1) - 1\n\nSince f maps [0,1] to itself (that is, f(x) is always in [0,1]), we know that:\n- f(0) \u2265 0, so g(0) = f(0) \u2265 0\n- f(1) \u2264 1, so g(1) = f(1) - 1 \u2264 0\n\nSo g(0) is non-negative and g(1) is non-positive.

Since C is connected and contains e, we can find continuous paths from e to a and from e to b within C. When we multiply these elements, the path multiplication is continuous (because G is a topological group), so ab remains in C.

For any point x in A, since x is not a limit point of A, there exists an open neighborhood U_x of x that contains no other points of A.\n\nNow, consider the collection of all these open neighborhoods U_x (for x \u2208 A) along with the open set X - A. This forms an open covering of X. Moreover, since A is infinite and each U_x contains exactly one point of A, this covering must be countable (as each point of A needs its own open set).\n\nBy countable compactness, there must be a finite subcollection that covers X. However, this is impossible because each U_x contains exactly one point of A, and A is infinite. Therefore, our assumption that A has no limit point must be false.\n\nNow, let's prove the other direction: if X is limit point compact, then it is countably compact.\n\nSuppose X is limit point compact, and let {U_n} be a countable open covering of X. We need to find a finite subcovering. Let's prove by contradiction. Assume no finite subcollection covers X.\n\nWe can construct a sequence of points {x_n} as follows: Choose x\u2081 \u2208 X. Since {U\u2081} doesn't cover X, choose x\u2082 not in U\u2081. Since {U\u2081, U\u2082} doesn't cover X, choose x\u2083 not in U\u2081 \u222a U\u2082, and so on.\n\nThis process gives us an infinite set A = {x\u2081, x\u2082, x\u2083, ...}. By limit point compactness, A must have a limit point p. Since {U_n} covers X, p must be in some U_k. But U_k is open, so it must contain infinitely many points of A. However, by our construction, no point after x_k can be in U_k, which is a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, a finite subcollection must cover X, proving that X is countably compact.\n\nThis completes the proof that countable compactness and limit point compactness are equivalent in T\u2081 spaces.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

I'll break this down into steps, showing first that f is injective (one-to-one), then surjective (onto).\n\nFirst, let's see why f is injective. Take any two points x\u2081 and x\u2082 in X. If f(x\u2081) = f(x\u2082), then by the isometry condition:\nd(x\u2081, x\u2082) = d(f(x\u2081), f(x\u2082)) = d(f(x\u2081), f(x\u2081)) = 0\nThis means x\u2081 = x\u2082, proving that f is injective.\n\nNow for the trickier part - showing f is surjective. Let's use a clever approach involving the compactness of X.\n\nTake any point y in X. We need to show there exists some x in X such that f(x) = y. Consider the function g(x) = d(f(x), y) which measures the distance from f(x) to our target point y. Since f is continuous (as an isometry) and d is continuous, g is a continuous function.\n\nBecause X is compact and g is continuous, g must attain its minimum value somewhere in X - let's call this point x\u2080. This minimum value must actually be zero, and here's why:\n\nSuppose g(x\u2080) > 0. Then consider the point sequence: x\u2080, f\u207b\u00b9(y), f\u207b\u00b2(y), ... where f\u207b\u00b9 means going \"backward\" one step. Because f preserves distances (it's an isometry), each step backward maintains the same distance to y. But X is compact, so this sequence must have a convergent subsequence. This would create a contradiction with the minimality of g(x\u2080).\n\nTherefore, g(x\u2080) = 0, which means f(x\u2080) = y. Since y was arbitrary, f is surjective.\n\nNow we have both injection and surjection, so f is bijective. Since f is continuous (as an isometry) and its inverse is also continuous (as can be shown using the isometry condition), f is a homeomorphism.\n\nThe key insight here was using compactness to force the distance-minimizing function to actually reach zero, proving surjectivity. The injectivity part followed directly from the isometry condition.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: type mismatch\n  hf x\u2081 x\u2082\nhas type\n  edist (f x\u2081) (f x\u2082) = edist x\u2081 x\u2082 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  dist x\u2081 x\u2082 = dist (f x\u2081) (f x\u2082) : Prop\napplication type mismatch\n  Continuous.comp continuous_id\nargument\n  continuous_id\nhas type\n  Continuous id : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  Continuous f : Prop\noverloaded, errors \n  24:97 unknown identifier 'Metric.isOpen_univ.nonempty'\n  \n  24:97 unknown identifier 'Metric.isOpen_univ.nonempty'\nfunction expected at\n  hx\u2080\nterm has type\n  x\u2080 \u2208 univ \u2227 \u2200 y \u2208 univ, ?m.5582 x\u2080 \u2264 ?m.5582 y\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: type mismatch\n  hf x\u2081 x\u2082\nhas type\n  edist (f x\u2081) (f x\u2082) = edist x\u2081 x\u2082 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  dist x\u2081 x\u2082 = dist (f x\u2081) (f x\u2082) : Prop\ntype mismatch\n  Continuous.comp continuous_dist (Continuous.prod_mk continuous_id continuous_const)\nhas type\n  Continuous ((fun p => dist p.1 p.2) \u2218 fun x => (id x, ?m.3899)) : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  Continuous g : Prop\noverloaded, errors \n  21:97 unknown identifier 'Metric.isOpen_univ.nonempty'\n  \n  21:97 unknown identifier 'Metric.isOpen_univ.nonempty'\ntype mismatch\n  hx\u2080\nhas type\n  x\u2080 \u2208 univ \u2227 \u2200 y \u2208 univ, ?m.8166 x\u2080 \u2264 ?m.8166 y : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u2200 (x : X), dist (f x) y \u2265 dist (f x\u2080) y : Prop\nunknown identifier 'Metric.isOpen_univ.nonempty'\napplication type mismatch\n  And.intro h_pos\nargument\n  h_pos\nhas type\n  \u00acdist (f x\u2080) y = 0 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  dist (f (?w n)) y > 0 : Prop\nunsolved goals\ncase w\nX : Type u_1\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : MetricSpace X\ninst\u271d : CompactSpace X\nf : X \u2192 X\nhf : Isometry f\nh_inj : Function.Injective f\ny : X\ng : X \u2192 \u211d := fun x => dist (f x) y\nh_cont : Continuous g\nh_compact : IsCompact univ\nx\u2080 : X\nhx\u2080 : x\u2080 \u2208 univ \u2227 \u2200 y \u2208 univ, ?m.8166 x\u2080 \u2264 ?m.8166 y\nh_min : \u2200 (x : X), dist (f x) y \u2265 dist (f x\u2080) y\nh_pos : \u00acdist (f x\u2080) y = 0\n\u22a2 \u2115 \u2192 X\napplication type mismatch\n  \u27e8strictMono_id, hx\u27e9\nargument\n  hx\nhas type\n  \u2200 (n : \u2115), dist (f (x n)) y > 0 \u2227 x n \u2208 univ : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u2200 (n : \u2115), dist (f (x n)) y > 0 : Prop\ntype mismatch\n  Continuous.tendsto (Isometry.continuous hf) x\u2080\nhas type\n  Tendsto f (\ud835\udcdd x\u2080) (\ud835\udcdd (f x\u2080)) : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  Tendsto (fun n => f (x (\u03c6 n))) atTop (\ud835\udcdd (f x\u2080)) : Prop\ntype mismatch\n  Continuous.tendsto (Continuous.comp continuous_dist (Continuous.prod_mk continuous_const continuous_id)) (z, y)\nhas type\n  Tendsto ((fun p => dist p.1 p.2) \u2218 fun x => (?m.13205, id x)) (\ud835\udcdd (z, y))\n    (\ud835\udcdd (((fun p => dist p.1 p.2) \u2218 fun x => (?m.13205, id x)) (z, y))) : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  Tendsto (fun n => dist (f (x (\u03c6 n))) y) atTop (\ud835\udcdd (dist z y)) : Prop\napplication type mismatch\n  Tendsto.comp h_dist_lim h_lim\nargument\n  h_lim\nhas type\n  Tendsto (fun n => f (x (\u03c6 n))) atTop (\ud835\udcdd z) : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  Tendsto ?m.17170 ?m.17172 atTop : Prop\nunknown identifier 'not_tendsto_const_nhds.mpr'\ntype mismatch\n  h_zero\nhas type\n  dist (f x\u2080) y = 0 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  f x\u2080 = y : Prop\nPlease revise the proof.",

A basic open set around a point consists of sequences that are uniformly close to that point.\n\nLet's take any arbitrary point x = (x\u2081, x\u2082, x\u2083, ...) in [0,1]\ufffd\u03c9 and any neighborhood U of x. I'll show that U cannot be contained in any compact set.\n\nConsider a small \u03b5 > 0 such that the ball B(x,\u03b5) is contained in U. In this ball, all sequences must be within \u03b5 of x at every coordinate. Now, I'll construct an infinite sequence of points in B(x,\u03b5) that has no convergent subsequence:\n\nFor each n \u2265 1, define y\u207f to be the sequence that equals x everywhere except at the nth coordinate, where it differs by \u03b5/2. Each y\u207f is in B(x,\u03b5) because the maximum difference from x is \u03b5/2.\n\nNow, for any two different points y\u1d50 and y\u207f in this sequence (m \u2260 n), their distance is exactly \u03b5/2, because they differ from each other only at their mth and nth coordinates. This makes them \u03b5/2 apart in the uniform metric.\n\nThis means we have constructed an infinite sequence where any two points are separated by at least \u03b5/2. Such a sequence cannot have a convergent subsequence because any convergent sequence in a metric space must be Cauchy, but our points always stay \u03b5/2 apart.\n\nTherefore, B(x,\u03b5) is not totally bounded and thus not compact.

We have a countable product of topological spaces, say X = \u220f\u1d62X\u1d62 where i ranges over a countable index set I. Each X\u1d62 has a countable dense subset, let's call it D\u1d62.\n\nThe key insight is that we don't need to use all possible combinations of points from the dense subsets to create a dense subset of the product space. Instead, we can use a clever construction involving what are sometimes called \"eventually constant\" sequences.\n\nHere's how we construct our countable dense subset D of X:\n1. Since I is countable, we can enumerate the dense subsets D\u1d62 of each factor space.\n2. For each coordinate i, D\u1d62 is also countable, so we can enumerate its elements.\n3. We'll construct D using sequences that differ from some fixed sequence at only finitely many coordinates.\n\nFor our construction, let's fix a base point p = (p\u1d62) where each p\u1d62 is some chosen point in D\u1d62. Now, we'll include in D all sequences that:\n- Differ from p at only finitely many coordinates\n- Where they do differ, they take values from the corresponding D\u1d62\n\nThis set D is countable because:\n- We're only changing finitely many coordinates at a time\n- We have countably many choices for which coordinates to change\n- We have countably many values to change to at each coordinate\n- Any finite combination of countable choices yields a countable set\n\nNow for the crucial part - showing D is dense in X:\nTake any open set U in X. By the definition of the product topology, U contains a basic open set B that is determined by finitely many coordinates, say i\u2081, ..., i\u2096.\nBecause each D\u1d62 is dense in X\u1d62, we can find points from D\u1d62 in the projection of B onto each of these k coordinates.\nWe can then construct a point in D that matches these chosen points in the k relevant coordinates and matches our base point p everywhere else.\nThis point will lie in B and thus in U.\n\nSince D intersects every open set in X, it is dense in X.\n\nTherefore, we have constructed a countable dense subset of X, proving the claim.\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  Exists.intro (s.prod t)\nargument\n  s.prod t\nhas type\n  Set (X 0 \u00d7 X 1) : Type u_1\nbut is expected to have type\n  Set ((i : \u2115) \u2192 X i) : Type u_1\nunknown identifier 'dense_prod_of_dense'\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  Exists.intro (s.prod t)\nargument\n  s.prod t\nhas type\n  Set (X 0 \u00d7 X 1) : Type u_1\nbut is expected to have type\n  Set ((i : \u2115) \u2192 X i) : Type u_1\ninvalid field 'prod', the environment does not contain 'Countable.prod'\n  hsc\nhas type\n  Countable \u2191s\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'let'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

To prove they have neighborhoods with disjoint closures, we can use the regularity property cleverly.\n\nSince X is regular and our topology satisfies the T\u2081 separation axiom (which is implied by regularity), the singleton set {y} is closed. Also, since x \u2260 y, we know that x is not in {y}.\n\nBy regularity, we can find disjoint open sets U and V where:\n- U contains x\n- V contains {y} (and thus contains y)\n\nNow here's the key insight: since U and V are disjoint open sets, the closure of U must be disjoint from V. Why? Because if the closure of U intersected V, there would be a point in V that was either in U or was a limit point of U, which can't happen since U and V are disjoint open sets.\n\nSimilarly, the closure of V must be disjoint from U.

To show X is completely regular, we need to prove that for any closed set F and any point p not in F, we can find a continuous function f from X to [0,1] such that f(p) = 1 and f(x) = 0 for all x in F.\n\nHere's how we can construct such a function:\n\n1) First, since X is Hausdorff, for any point x in F, we can separate p and x with disjoint open sets.\n\n2) Since X is locally compact, we can find a compact neighborhood K of p. That is, there exists an open set U containing p such that its closure K is compact.\n\n3) Since F is closed and p is not in F, there must be some open set V containing p that doesn't intersect F. We can assume V is contained in U by taking the intersection if necessary.\n\n4) By the compactness of K and the fact that X is Hausdorff, we can use Urysohn's lemma for compact Hausdorff spaces on K: there exists a continuous function g from K to [0,1] such that g(p) = 1 and g is 0 on the boundary of K.\n\n5) We can extend g to all of X by defining f(x) = g(x) for x in K and f(x) = 0 for x outside K. This extension is continuous because g is 0 on the boundary of K.\n\n6) The resulting function f is continuous, maps p to 1, and maps all points in F to 0 (since F is disjoint from V, which contains p).\n\nTherefore, we have constructed a continuous function separating any closed set from any point not in it, which proves that X is completely regular.\n\nThe key insight is that local compactness gives us enough structure to build continuous functions locally (in a compact neighborhood) and then extend them globally, while the Hausdorff property ensures we can separate points, which is essential for the construction.\nPrevious attempt failed with: invalid field 't2_separation', the environment does not contain 'T2Space.t2_separation'\n  hX'\nhas type\n  T2Space X\nrcases tactic failed: x\u271d : ?m.1149 is not an inductive datatype\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: invalid field 't2_separation', the environment does not contain 'T2Space.t2_separation'\n  hX'\nhas type\n  T2Space X\nrcases tactic failed: x\u271d : ?m.1149 is not an inductive datatype\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  eventually_of_mem (LocallyCompactSpace.local_compact_nhds x A\u1d9c)\nargument\n  LocallyCompactSpace.local_compact_nhds x A\u1d9c\nhas type\n  A\u1d9c \u2208 \ud835\udcdd x \u2192 \u2203 s \u2208 \ud835\udcdd x, s \u2286 A\u1d9c \u2227 IsCompact s : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  ?m.1390 \u2208 ?m.1388 : Prop\nfailed to synthesize\n  Membership ?m.2036 X\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nunknown identifier 'exists_continuous_zero_one_of_isCompact_isClosed'\napplication type mismatch\n  hfK y\nargument\n  y\nhas type\n  \u2191I : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  X : Type u_1\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  ?y \u2208 ?f '' ?s\ncase h.h.mpr\nX : Type u_1\ninst\u271d : TopologicalSpace X\nhX : LocallyCompactSpace X\nhX' : T2Space X\nx : X\nA : Set X\nhA : IsClosed A \u2227 x \u2209 A\nh1 : \u2200\u1da0 (x : X) in \ud835\udcdd x, \u2203 K, IsCompact K \u2227 x \u2208 interior K \u2227 K \u2286 A\u1d9c\nK : X\nhK : Set X\nhxK : IsCompact hK\nhKA : K \u2208 interior hK \u2227 hK \u2286 A\u1d9c\nf : X \u2192 \u2191I\nhf : Continuous f\nhfx : f x = 1\nhfK : \u2200 (y : X), sorryAx Prop true \u2192 f y = 0\ny : \u2191I\nhy : y \u2208 {0}\n\u22a2 y \u2208 f '' A\nPlease revise the proof.",

The proof relies on a key theorem about metrizable spaces and combines several important properties of compact Hausdorff spaces.\n\nFirst, recall that a space is metrizable if and only if it is regular and has a countable base (i.e., is second countable). Since X is Hausdorff and compact, it is automatically regular, so we only need to show that X has a countable base.\n\nSince X\u2081 and X\u2082 are metrizable, each has a countable base. Let's call these bases B\u2081 and B\u2082 respectively. Because X\u2081 and X\u2082 are closed in X and X is compact Hausdorff, both X\u2081 and X\u2082 are compact (as closed subsets of a compact space).\n\nNow, here's the key insight: for any open set U in X, we can write U \u2229 X\u2081 as a union of elements from B\u2081, and U \u2229 X\u2082 as a union of elements from B\u2082. Because X\u2081 and X\u2082 are compact, we can actually take finite unions in each case.\n\nThis means we can construct a countable base for X by considering all possible finite unions of elements from B\u2081 in X\u2081 and elements from B\u2082 in X\u2082. Specifically, we can take the collection of all sets of the form (V\u2081 \u222a V\u2082) where V\u2081 is a finite union of elements from B\u2081 and V\u2082 is a finite union of elements from B\u2082.\n\nThis collection forms a countable base for X because:\n1. It's countable (as it's formed from combinations of elements from two countable sets)\n2. It can generate any open set in X (due to the compactness of X\u2081 and X\u2082)\n\nSince X is regular (being compact Hausdorff) and has a countable base, it must be metrizable according to Urysohn's Metrization Theorem.\n\nTherefore, X is metrizable.\nPrevious attempt failed with: expected ';' or line break\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: expected ';' or line break\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

Since f is uniformly continuous on A, I'll show that f(x\u2099) forms a Cauchy sequence in Y, and since Y is complete, this sequence converges to some point in Y. We'll define this limit as g(x).\n\nHere's why f(x\u2099) is Cauchy: Given any \u03b5 > 0, uniform continuity of f means there exists \u03b4 > 0 such that for any points p,q in A, if d_X(p,q) < \u03b4, then d_Y(f(p),f(q)) < \u03b5. Since (x\u2099) is convergent, it's Cauchy, so for large enough n,m, d_X(x\u2099,x\u2098) < \u03b4. Therefore, d_Y(f(x\u2099),f(x\u2098)) < \u03b5, making f(x\u2099) Cauchy.\n\nNow we can define g(x) = lim f(x\u2099). This definition is independent of which sequence we choose converging to x, because if we had another sequence (y\u2099) converging to x, the uniform continuity of f would ensure that f(x\u2099) and f(y\u2099) converge to the same limit.\n\nFor uniqueness, suppose h were another continuous extension. For any x in \u0100, take a sequence (x\u2099) in A converging to x. Then h(x) = lim h(x\u2099) = lim f(x\u2099) = g(x), by continuity of h and our definition of g.\n\nFinally, g is uniformly continuous because the uniform continuity condition for f carries over to g through limits. Given \u03b5 > 0, take the same \u03b4 that works for f's uniform continuity. For any points p,q in \u0100 with d_X(p,q) < \u03b4, we can approximate them by sequences in A and use the uniform continuity of f along with the continuity of the metric to show d_Y(g(p),g(q)) \u2264 \u03b5.\n\nTherefore, g is indeed a unique, uniformly continuous extension of f to \u0100.\nPrevious attempt failed with: \nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: \nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: \nPlease revise the proof.",

We can write it as a single fraction by finding a common denominator. The common denominator would be the least common multiple of all numbers from 2 to n, let's call this LCM(2,3,...,n).\n\nWhen we convert each fraction to this common denominator and add them up, we get a fraction where:\n- The numerator is some integer\n- The denominator is LCM(2,3,...,n)\n\nFor this sum to be an integer, the denominator must divide the numerator evenly.\n\nNow, here's the key insight: In the prime factorization of LCM(2,3,...,n), the highest power of 2 comes from the largest power of 2 that's less than or equal to n.\n\nHowever, when we look at the numerator after combining all fractions, the power of 2 in its prime factorization must be less than the power of 2 in the denominator. This is because each term $\\frac{1}{k}$ contributes at most one factor of 2 to the numerator (when k is odd), while the denominator contains the highest power of 2 \u2264 n.\n\nTherefore, the numerator has fewer factors of 2 than the denominator, which means the denominator cannot divide the numerator evenly.

It's the product of all integers from 1 to (n-1).\n\n4) Since a is less than or equal to n/2 and also less than n, a appears as one of the factors in (n-1)!\n\n5) Similarly, since b = n/a is less than n, b also appears as one of the factors in (n-1)!\n\n6) Therefore, (n-1)! contains both a and b as factors, meaning it contains their product n as a factor.\n\n7) Thus, (n-1)! is divisible by n, or in modular notation, (n-1)! \u2261 0 (mod n)\n\nThe case n=4 is the only exception because:\n- 4 = 2 \u00d7 2\n- (4-1)! = 3! = 6\n- 6 is not divisible by 4\n\nThis completes our proof, showing that for all composite numbers except 4, (n-1)! is divisible by n.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown constant 'Nat.modEq_zero_of_dvd'\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown constant 'Nat.modEq_zero_of_dvd'\nPlease revise the proof.",

This means the multiplicative group modulo p has order 4t.\n\nNow, let's consider what happens when we take -a modulo p. When we raise -a to some power k, we can use the properties of exponents:\n(-a)^k = (-1)^k * a^k\n\nThe key insight is to look at what happens with (-1)^k:\n- When k is even, (-1)^k = 1\n- When k is odd, (-1)^k = -1\n\nIf a is a primitive root modulo p, then a^k takes on all non-zero values modulo p as k goes from 1 to p-1 = 4t.\n\nNow, if we look at (-a)^k, we're essentially multiplying each value of a^k by either 1 or -1, depending on whether k is even or odd. Since p = 4t + 1, negating a number modulo p just gives us another non-zero residue modulo p.\n\nThis means that as k varies, (-a)^k will also generate all non-zero residues modulo p, just in a different order than a^k does. Therefore, -a must also have order p-1 = 4t.\n\nConversely, if -a is a primitive root, the same argument shows that a must be a primitive root.\n\nThus, a is a primitive root modulo p if and only if -a is a primitive root modulo p.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

Here's the reasoning:\n\nFirst, recall that for a Fermat prime p = 2^n + 1, n must be a power of 2, and p must be prime. Also, for 3 to be a primitive root modulo p, it must generate all non-zero residues modulo p through its powers.\n\nThe order of 3 modulo p must divide p-1 = 2^n. Since p-1 is a power of 2, the order of 3 must also be a power of 2. Let's call this order m.\n\nThe key insight is that 3^2 \u2261 9 (mod p), and each subsequent squaring gives us:\n3^4 \u2261 81 \u2261 -1 (mod p)\n\nThis means that 3^4 \u2261 -1 (mod p) for any Fermat prime p. Therefore:\n3^8 \u2261 1 (mod p)\n\nNow, if m (the order of 3) were less than p-1, it would have to be at most p-1/2 (since m must divide p-1). But this would mean 3 raised to that power would be 1 modulo p, contradicting what we found about 3^4 \u2261 -1 (mod p).\n\nTherefore, the order of 3 must be exactly p-1 = 2^n, which means 3 is a primitive root modulo p.\n\nThis proof works because we showed that 3 cannot have an order smaller than p-1, and since its order must divide p-1, it must equal p-1, making it a primitive root.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  ?m.856 % ?m.856.succ\np n : \u2115\nhp : p.Prime\nhpn : p = 2 ^ n + 1\n\u22a2 (3 % (2 ^ n + 1)) ^ n % (2 ^ n + 1) = 2 ^ n + 1 - 1\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  3 ^ n % p\np n : \u2115\nhp : p.Prime\nhpn : p = 2 ^ n + 1\nh1 : 3 ^ n % p = p - 1\n\u22a2 (3 ^ 2 % p) ^ n % p = 1\ninvalid field notation, type is not of the form (C ...) where C is a constant\n  IsPrimitiveRoot\nhas type\n  ?m.1089 \u2192 \u2115 \u2192 Prop\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier '\u03c6'\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  p.totient\np n : \u2115\nhp : p.Prime\nhpn : p = 2 ^ n + 1\n\u22a2 sorryAx \u2115 true = 2 ^ n\nunknown constant 'Nat.pow_mod_eq_one'\ntactic 'apply' failed, failed to unify\n  ?p ^ ?n.factorization ?p \u2223 ?n\nwith\n  2 ^ n \u2223 k\np n : \u2115\nhp : p.Prime\nhpn : p = 2 ^ n + 1\nh_phi : sorryAx \u2115 true = 2 ^ n\nh_pow : 3 ^ 2 ^ n % p = 1\nk : \u2115\nhk : k < 2 ^ n\n\u22a2 2 ^ n \u2223 k\nunknown constant 'Nat.eq_of_dvd_of_lt'\napplication type mismatch\n  IsPrimitiveRoot.mk_of_lt 3 p\nargument\n  p\nhas type\n  \u2115 : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  0 < p : Prop\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  IsPrimitiveRoot.mk_of_lt 3 p\nargument\n  p\nhas type\n  \u2115 : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  0 < ?m.1197 : Prop\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase h1.h\np n : \u2115\nhp : p.Prime\nhpn : p = 2 ^ n + 1\nh1 : 3 ^ n % p = p - 1\nh2 : (3 ^ 2 % p) ^ n % p = 1\na\u271d : 3 ^ ?m.1197 < 1\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nPlease revise the proof.",

This means that 2 is a fourth power residue modulo $p$. By the properties of quadratic residues, this implies that 2 is also a quadratic residue modulo $p$ (since if $x^4 \\equiv 2(p)$, then $(x^2)^2 \\equiv 2(p)$).\n\nWhen 2 is a quadratic residue modulo $p$, and $p \\equiv 1(4)$, a fundamental result in number theory tells us that $p$ can be represented as a sum of squares in the form $A^2 + 64B^2$. This is related to the theory of quadratic forms and genus theory.\n\nFor the reverse direction, if $p = A^2 + 64B^2$, then 2 is guaranteed to be a quadratic residue modulo $p$. When $p \\equiv 1(4)$, the multiplicative group modulo $p$ has an order divisible by 4, which means that every quadratic residue is also a fourth power residue.\n\nTherefore, if $p = A^2 + 64B^2$, then 2 is a fourth power residue modulo $p$, which means there exists an $x$ such that $x^4 \\equiv 2(p)$.\n\nThe key insight is that the condition $p \\equiv 1(4)$ ensures that fourth roots exist when quadratic roots exist, and the representation $p = A^2 + 64B^2$ is equivalent to 2 being a quadratic residue modulo $p$.

Using the recurrence relation:\n   x\u2096\u208a\u2081 = 2(x\u2096)(x\u2096\u208b\u2081) - x\u2096\u208b\u2082\n   Since x\u2096 = 0, this simplifies to:\n   x\u2096\u208a\u2081 = -x\u2096\u208b\u2082\n\n3) Now let's look at x\u2096\u208a\u2082:\n   x\u2096\u208a\u2082 = 2(x\u2096\u208a\u2081)(x\u2096) - x\u2096\u208b\u2081\n   Since x\u2096 = 0, this simplifies to:\n   x\u2096\u208a\u2082 = -x\u2096\u208b\u2081\n\n4) And for x\u2096\u208a\u2083:\n   x\u2096\u208a\u2083 = 2(x\u2096\u208a\u2082)(x\u2096\u208a\u2081) - x\u2096\n   = 2(-x\u2096\u208b\u2081)(-x\u2096\u208b\u2082) - 0\n   = 2x\u2096\u208b\u2081x\u2096\u208b\u2082\n   = x\u2096\u208b\u2082\n\n5) Following this pattern, we can see that:\n   x\u2096\u208a\u2081 = -x\u2096\u208b\u2082\n   x\u2096\u208a\u2082 = -x\u2096\u208b\u2081\n   x\u2096\u208a\u2083 = x\u2096\u208b\u2082\n   x\u2096\u208a\u2084 = x\u2096\u208b\u2081\n   x\u2096\u208a\u2085 = 0 = x\u2096\n\n6) This shows that after we hit a zero, the sequence follows a pattern that repeats every 5 terms:\n   - The two terms before the zero\n   - The zero itself\n   - The negatives of the two terms before the zero\n   - Back to the original zero\n\nTherefore, once we encounter a zero in the sequence, the sequence becomes periodic with period 5.\n\nThis completes our proof that if any term in the sequence is zero, then the sequence must be periodic.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unsolved goals\ncase h.zero\na : \u211d\nx : \u2115 \u2192 \u211d\nm : \u2115\nhx0 : 0 = a\nhx1 : x 1 = a\nhxn : \u2200 (n : \u2115), 2 \u2264 n \u2192 x (n + 1) = 2 * x n * x (n - 1) - x (n - 2)\nhn : x 0 = a\n\u22a2 2 * (2 * (2 * x (m + 2) * x (m + 1) - x m) * x (m + 2) - x (m + 1)) * (2 * x (m + 2) * x (m + 1) - x m) - x (m + 2) =\n    x m\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase h.succ.h1.h\na : \u211d\nx : \u2115 \u2192 \u211d\nhx0 : x 0 = a\nhx1 : x 1 = a\nm n : \u2115\nhxn : \u2200 (n : \u2115), 2 \u2264 n \u2192 x (n + 1) = 2 * x n * x (n - 1) - x (n - 2)\nih :\n  x n = 0 \u2192\n    2 * (2 * (2 * x (m + 2) * x (m + 1) - x m) * x (m + 2) - x (m + 1)) * (2 * x (m + 2) * x (m + 1) - x m) -\n        x (m + 2) =\n      x m\nhn : x (n + 1) = 0\na\u271d :\n  2 * (2 * (2 * x (m + 2) * x (m + 1) - x m) * x (m + 2) - x (m + 1)) * (2 * x (m + 2) * x (m + 1) - x m) - x (m + 2) <\n    x m\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nunsolved goals\ncase h.succ\na : \u211d\nx : \u2115 \u2192 \u211d\nhx0 : x 0 = a\nhx1 : x 1 = a\nm n : \u2115\nhxn : \u2200 (n : \u2115), 2 \u2264 n \u2192 x (n + 1) = 2 * x n * x (n - 1) - x (n - 2)\nih :\n  x n = 0 \u2192\n    2 * (2 * (2 * x (m + 2) * x (m + 1) - x m) * x (m + 2) - x (m + 1)) * (2 * x (m + 2) * x (m + 1) - x m) -\n        x (m + 2) =\n      x m\nhn : x (n + 1) = 0\n\u22a2 2 * (2 * (2 * x (m + 2) * x (m + 1) - x m) * x (m + 2) - x (m + 1)) * (2 * x (m + 2) * x (m + 1) - x m) - x (m + 2) =\n    x m\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unsolved goals\ncase h.zero\na : \u211d\nx : \u2115 \u2192 \u211d\nm : \u2115\nhx0 : 0 = a\nhx1 : x 1 = a\nhxn : \u2200 (n : \u2115), 2 \u2264 n \u2192 x (n + 1) = 2 * x n * x (n - 1) - x (n - 2)\nhn : x 0 = a\n\u22a2 2 * (2 * (2 * x (m + 2) * x (m + 1) - x m) * x (m + 2) - x (m + 1)) * (2 * x (m + 2) * x (m + 1) - x m) - x (m + 2) =\n    x m\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase h.succ.h1.h\na : \u211d\nx : \u2115 \u2192 \u211d\nhx0 : x 0 = a\nhx1 : x 1 = a\nm n : \u2115\nhxn : \u2200 (n : \u2115), 2 \u2264 n \u2192 x (n + 1) = 2 * x n * x (n - 1) - x (n - 2)\nih :\n  x n = 0 \u2192\n    2 * (2 * (2 * x (m + 2) * x (m + 1) - x m) * x (m + 2) - x (m + 1)) * (2 * x (m + 2) * x (m + 1) - x m) -\n        x (m + 2) =\n      x m\nhn : x (n + 1) = 0\na\u271d :\n  2 * (2 * (2 * x (m + 2) * x (m + 1) - x m) * x (m + 2) - x (m + 1)) * (2 * x (m + 2) * x (m + 1) - x m) - x (m + 2) <\n    x m\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unsolved goals\ncase h.zero\na : \u211d\nx : \u2115 \u2192 \u211d\nm : \u2115\nhx0 : 0 = a\nhx1 : x 1 = a\nhxn : \u2200 (n : \u2115), 2 \u2264 n \u2192 x (n + 1) = 2 * x n * x (n - 1) - x (n - 2)\nhn : x 0 = a\n\u22a2 2 * (2 * (2 * x (m + 2) * x (m + 1) - x m) * x (m + 2) - x (m + 1)) * (2 * x (m + 2) * x (m + 1) - x m) - x (m + 2) =\n    x m\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase h.succ.h1.h\na : \u211d\nx : \u2115 \u2192 \u211d\nhx0 : x 0 = a\nhx1 : x 1 = a\nm n : \u2115\nhxn : \u2200 (n : \u2115), 2 \u2264 n \u2192 x (n + 1) = 2 * x n * x (n - 1) - x (n - 2)\nih :\n  x n = 0 \u2192\n    2 * (2 * (2 * x (m + 2) * x (m + 1) - x m) * x (m + 2) - x (m + 1)) * (2 * x (m + 2) * x (m + 1) - x m) -\n        x (m + 2) =\n      x m\nhn : x (n + 1) = 0\na\u271d :\n  2 * (2 * (2 * x (m + 2) * x (m + 1) - x m) * x (m + 2) - x (m + 1)) * (2 * x (m + 2) * x (m + 1) - x m) - x (m + 2) <\n    x m\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nPlease revise the proof.",

At x\u2080, we have g(x\u2080) \u2265 2.\n\nIf we differentiate g(x), we get:\ng'(x) = [f''(x)f(x) - (f'(x))\u00b2]/[f(x)]\u00b2\n\nSince f and all its derivatives are positive, at any point where g(x) \u2265 2, we have:\nf'(x) \u2265 2f(x)\n(f'(x))\u00b2 \u2265 4(f(x))\u00b2\n\nTherefore, at such points:\ng'(x) = [f''(x)f(x) - (f'(x))\u00b2]/[f(x)]\u00b2 \u2265 0\n\nThis means that once g(x) reaches 2, it must keep increasing.\n\nNow, if we differentiate g'(x), we can show (through algebraic manipulation) that g''(x) is also positive when g(x) \u2265 2, and furthermore, that g'''(x) \u2265 0 due to our assumption that f'''(x) \u2264 f(x).\n\nThis creates a contradiction because:\n1. g(x\u2080) \u2265 2\n2. g'(x\u2080) > 0\n3. g''(x\u2080) > 0\n4. g'''(x) \u2265 0\n\nThese conditions would force g(x), and consequently f'(x)/f(x), to grow without bound as x increases beyond x\u2080.

This would mean that there exists some integers a, b, and c where for every positive integer n, \u221a(n\u00b3 + an\u00b2 + bn + c) is always an integer.\n\nLet's call \u221a(n\u00b3 + an\u00b2 + bn + c) = k, where k is some integer that depends on n.\nThis means that n\u00b3 + an\u00b2 + bn + c = k\u00b2\n\nNow, let's think about how these expressions grow as n becomes very large:\n- The left side n\u00b3 + an\u00b2 + bn + c is a cubic polynomial\n- The dominant term as n grows large is n\u00b3\n- The other terms an\u00b2, bn, and c become negligible in comparison to n\u00b3 for large enough n\n\nOn the right side, we have k\u00b2, which is a perfect square.\n\nHere's the key insight: for very large n, the left side is approximately n\u00b3, so k\u00b2 \u2248 n\u00b3\nThis means k \u2248 n^(3/2)\n\nBut this is impossible! If k is an integer, k\u00b2 must be a perfect square. However, for large enough n, n\u00b3 cannot be a perfect square because its exponent is 3, which is odd.
