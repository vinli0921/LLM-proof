This means that each score x\u1d62 satisfies L \u2264 x\u1d62 \u2264 H.\n\nWhen we take the class average, we're essentially taking all these scores that lie between L and H, and finding their mean. A fundamental property of means (which we can see from the given context theorem) is that when we average numbers that all lie between two values, the result must also lie between those values.\n\nTherefore:\n- Since every score x\u1d62 is greater than or equal to L\n- And every score x\u1d62 is less than or equal to H\n- The average of all these scores must also be greater than or equal to L and less than or equal to H\n- More specifically, the class average must be greater than or equal to the lowest score L and less than or equal to the highest score H\n\nNow, from the theorem in the context about means of unequal real numbers, we know that the average of two unequal numbers lies strictly between them. In our case, since L < H (as 45 < 100), we know that:\nL < (L + H)/2 < H\n\nCombining these facts:\n- The class average lies between L and H\n- (L + H)/2 lies between L and H\n- The class average includes all scores, not just the extremes\n- Therefore, the class average must be at least as large as (L + H)/2\n\nThus, the average of the lowest and highest scores must be less than or equal to the class average.\nPrevious attempt failed with: expected ';' or line break\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'apply' failed, failed to unify\n  ?m.1538.sum ?m.1539 \u2264 ?m.1538.card \u2022 30\nwith\n  \u2211 i : Fin 30, scores i \u2265 30 * L\nL H : \u211d\nscores : Fin 30 \u2192 \u211d\nhL : L = 45\nhH : H = 100\nh_bounds : \u2200 (i : Fin 30), L \u2264 scores i \u2227 scores i \u2264 H\n\u22a2 \u2211 i : Fin 30, scores i \u2265 30 * L\ntactic 'apply' failed, failed to unify\n  ?m.2408.sum ?m.2409 \u2264 ?m.2408.card \u2022 30\nwith\n  \u2211 i : Fin 30, scores i \u2264 30 * H\nL H : \u211d\nscores : Fin 30 \u2192 \u211d\nhL : L = 45\nhH : H = 100\nh_bounds : \u2200 (i : Fin 30), L \u2264 scores i \u2227 scores i \u2264 H\nh_sum : \u2211 i : Fin 30, scores i \u2265 30 * L\n\u22a2 \u2211 i : Fin 30, scores i \u2264 30 * H\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  L\nL H : \u211d\nscores : Fin 30 \u2192 \u211d\nhL : L = 45\nhH : H = 100\nh_bounds : \u2200 (i : Fin 30), L \u2264 scores i \u2227 scores i \u2264 H\nh_sum : \u2211 i : Fin 30, scores i \u2265 30 * 45\nh_sum' : \u2211 i : Fin 30, scores i \u2264 30 * H\n\u22a2 (L + H) / 2 \u2264 (\u2211 i : Fin 30, scores i) / 30\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'apply' failed, failed to unify\n  ?m.1583.sum ?m.1584 \u2264 ?m.1583.card \u2022 30\nwith\n  \u2211 i : Fin 30, scores i \u2265 30 * L\nL H : \u211d\nscores : Fin 30 \u2192 \u211d\nhL : L = 45\nhH : H = 100\nh_bounds : \u2200 (i : Fin 30), L \u2264 scores i \u2227 scores i \u2264 H\n\u22a2 \u2211 i : Fin 30, scores i \u2265 30 * L\ntactic 'apply' failed, failed to unify\n  ?m.2453.sum ?m.2454 \u2264 ?m.2453.card \u2022 30\nwith\n  \u2211 i : Fin 30, scores i \u2264 30 * H\nL H : \u211d\nscores : Fin 30 \u2192 \u211d\nhL : L = 45\nhH : H = 100\nh_bounds : \u2200 (i : Fin 30), L \u2264 scores i \u2227 scores i \u2264 H\nh_sum_lower : \u2211 i : Fin 30, scores i \u2265 30 * L\n\u22a2 \u2211 i : Fin 30, scores i \u2264 30 * H\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase a\nL H : \u211d\nscores : Fin 30 \u2192 \u211d\nhL : 45 = 45\nhH : 100 = 100\nh_bounds : \u2200 (i : Fin 30), 45 \u2264 scores i \u2227 scores i \u2264 100\nh_sum_lower : \u2211 i : Fin 30, scores i \u2265 30 * 45\nh_sum_upper : \u2211 i : Fin 30, scores i \u2264 30 * 100\na\u271d : (45 + 100) / 2 > (\u2211 i : Fin 30, scores i) / 30\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nPlease revise the proof.",

Here's the reasoning:\n\nFirst, let's understand what it means for P(x) to be a polynomial of degree n. This means that P(x) can be written as a sum of terms where the highest power of x is n, like anx\u207f + an-1x\u207f\u207b\u00b9 + ... + a\u2081x + a\u2080, where an \u2260 0.\n\nNow, let's use a proof by contradiction. Suppose P(x) is not the zero polynomial and has n+1 distinct roots, which we'll call r\u2081, r\u2082, ..., rn+1.\n\nBy the Factor Theorem, if r is a root of P(x), then (x - r) must be a factor of P(x). Since we have n+1 distinct roots, P(x) must be divisible by all factors (x - r\u2081), (x - r\u2082), ..., (x - rn+1).\n\nThis means P(x) can be written as:\nP(x) = k(x - r\u2081)(x - r\u2082)...(x - rn+1)\nwhere k is some constant.\n\nBut when we multiply out these n+1 factors, we get a polynomial of degree n+1, because each (x - r\u1d62) factor contributes one degree to the final polynomial.\n\nThis contradicts our original assumption that P(x) is a polynomial of degree n. The only way to resolve this contradiction is if k = 0, which means P(x) must be the zero polynomial.\n\nThis makes intuitive sense because the zero polynomial is the only polynomial that can have infinitely many roots, as it equals zero for all values of x. Any non-zero polynomial of degree n can have at most n roots, as each root corresponds to a linear factor in its factorization.\n\nTherefore, P(x) must be the zero polynomial.\nPrevious attempt failed with: invalid field notation, function 'Multiset.card' does not have argument with type (Multiset ...) that can be used, it must be explicit or implicit with a unique name\ninvalid field notation, function 'Multiset.card' does not have argument with type (Multiset ...) that can be used, it must be explicit or implicit with a unique name\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  P.degree\nP : Polynomial \u2124\nn : \u2115\nhP : P.degree = \u2191n\nh : sorryAx \u2115 true = n + 1\n\u22a2 sorryAx \u2115 true \u2264 n\nfailed to synthesize\n  LinearOrder (Polynomial \u2124)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  Membership \u2124 (Multiset \u2115)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nunknown constant 'Polynomial.eq_zero_of_zero_eq_one'\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown constant 'Polynomial.eq_zero_of_zero_eq_one'\nPlease revise the proof.",

Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. First, let's identify what we know:\n   - There are 30 students in total\n   - 10 students wore red on Monday\n   - 15 students wore red on Tuesday\n\n2. The key insight is that we can't simply add 10 + 15, because some students might have worn red on both days. This is a classic case where we need to use the inclusion-exclusion principle.\n\n3. Let's call:\n   - M = the set of students who wore red on Monday\n   - T = the set of students who wore red on Tuesday\n\n4. The total number we're looking for is |M \u222a T| (the union of both sets)\n\n5. By the inclusion-exclusion principle:\n   |M \u222a T| = |M| + |T| - |M \u2229 T|\n\n6. We know |M| = 10 and |T| = 15\n\n7. To find |M \u2229 T|, we can use the fact that:\n   - The intersection can't be negative\n   - The union can't exceed the total number of students (30)\n   - |M \u2229 T| must be at most the smaller of |M| and |T|, which is 10\n\n8. Therefore:\n   - The minimum possible total is 15 (if all Monday students also wore red Tuesday)\n   - The maximum possible total is 25 (if no student wore red both days)\n\nWithout additional information about the overlap between Monday and Tuesday, we cannot determine a single exact answer.

A rectangle has four sides - two long sides and two short sides. The long sides are equal in length to each other, and the short sides are equal in length to each other.\n\nIn this case:\n- The length is 10 feet, which gives us two long sides of 10 feet each\n- The width is 6 feet, which gives us two short sides of 6 feet each\n\nTo get the total fencing needed, we add up all four sides:\n- First long side: 10 feet\n- Second long side: 10 feet\n- First short side: 6 feet\n- Second short side: 6 feet\n\nTherefore, the total amount of fencing needed would be 10 + 10 + 6 + 6 = 32 feet.\n\nThis can also be thought of using the standard perimeter formula for a rectangle: P = 2l + 2w, where l is length and w is width.

We need to show that for any small positive number \u03b5, we can find a small positive number \u03b4 such that\n2. Whenever a point (x,y) is within distance \u03b4 of (1,2), f(x,y) is within distance \u03b5 of f(1,2)\n\nThe function f(x,y) = x\u00b2y - 3xy\u00b2 + 5 is made up of basic operations (addition, multiplication) of continuous functions:\n- x\u00b2 is continuous\n- y is continuous\n- Their product x\u00b2y is continuous\n- Similarly, xy\u00b2 is continuous\n- The constant 5 is continuous\n- Sums and differences of continuous functions are continuous\n\nSince our function is built from these basic continuous operations, it will be continuous at (1,2). This is because:\n1. Each term in the function (x\u00b2y, xy\u00b2, and 5) is continuous at (1,2)\n2. When we multiply and add continuous functions, the result remains continuous\n3. The operations of addition, subtraction, and multiplication preserve continuity\n\nWe could make this rigorous by showing that small changes in x and y near (1,2) result in small changes in each term of the function, and therefore in the entire function. The change in f(x,y) can be controlled by controlling how close (x,y) is to (1,2) using an appropriate choice of \u03b4 for any given \u03b5.\n\nThis approach mirrors the context proof's strategy of showing how changes in the input relate to changes in the output, though our function is more complex than the simple addition shown in the context.\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  ContinuousAt f (1, 2)\nargument\n  (1, 2)\nhas type\n  ?m.1143 \u00d7 ?m.1154 : Type (max ?u.1139 ?u.1138)\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u211d : Type\nunknown identifier 'continuousAt_of_continuous_on_of_open'\nPlease revise the proof.",

Imagine drawing this curve - it starts at some point and must return to exactly the same height at the end.\n\nNow, there are only two possible scenarios for how this curve could behave:\n\n1. The function could be completely flat (constant) between a and b. In this case, the derivative would be zero everywhere between a and b, so we'd definitely have a point c where f'(c) = 0.\n\n2. If the function isn't constant, then it must either go up and then come back down, or go down and then come back up (or do this multiple times) to return to its original height. This is because the function is continuous - it can't jump around.\n\nIn this second case, somewhere along this path, the function must reach either its highest point (a maximum) or its lowest point (a minimum) between a and b. This is guaranteed by the fact that the function is continuous on a closed interval [a,b], so it must attain both a maximum and minimum value.\n\nThis maximum or minimum point can't occur at the endpoints a or b, because if it did, and if it was the only extreme point, the function couldn't return to its original height. Therefore, at least one of these extreme points must occur at some point c inside the interval (a,b).\n\nSince the function is differentiable, and c is a maximum or minimum point that occurs inside the interval, the derivative at this point must be zero. This is because at any maximum or minimum point that's not at an endpoint, the tangent line must be horizontal, meaning f'(c) = 0.\n\nTherefore, we've shown that there must be at least one point c between a and b where the derivative equals zero, which is what we wanted to prove.\n\nThis is essentially Rolle's Theorem, and it's a fundamental result that tells us something very intuitive: if a continuous, differentiable function returns to its starting height, it must have a horizontal tangent line somewhere along the way.\nPrevious attempt failed with: function expected at\n  Icc\nterm has type\n  ?m.386\nfunction expected at\n  Ioo\nterm has type\n  ?m.894\nfunction expected at\n  Ioo\nterm has type\n  ?m.894\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: function expected at\n  Icc\nterm has type\n  ?m.386\nfunction expected at\n  Ioo\nterm has type\n  ?m.894\nfunction expected at\n  Ioo\nterm has type\n  ?m.894\nfunction expected at\n  Ioo\nterm has type\n  x\u271d\nunsolved goals\nx\u271d\u00b9 : Sort u_1\nIcc : x\u271d\u00b9\nx\u271d : Sort u_2\nIoo : x\u271d\nf : \u211d \u2192 \u211d\na b : \u211d\nhab : a < b\nhf : ContinuousOn f (sorryAx (Set \u211d) true)\nhf' : DifferentiableOn \u211d f (sorryAx (Set \u211d) true)\nhfa : f a = f b\n\u22a2 \u2203 c \u2208 ?m.3630 f a b hab hf hf' hfa c, deriv f c = 0\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: function expected at\n  Icc\nterm has type\n  ?m.140\nfunction expected at\n  Ioo\nterm has type\n  ?m.315\nfunction expected at\n  Ioo\nterm has type\n  ?m.315\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

This rule states that log_a(x^n) = n*log_a(x):\n- log_a(b^p) becomes p*log_a(b)\n- log_a(c^q) becomes q*log_a(c)\n\nNow, we know that log_a(b) = m and log_a(c) = n from our given conditions, so:\n- p*log_a(b) becomes p*m\n- q*log_a(c) becomes q*n\n\nWhen we put it all together, we get p*m + q*n, which is exactly what we wanted to prove.\n\nThis proof relies on the fundamental properties of logarithms and simple substitution of known values, making it both elegant and straightforward.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  (?m.551 ^ ?y).log\nm n : \u211d\np q : \u2115\na b c : \u211d\nha : a > 0 \u2227 a \u2260 1\nhb : b > 0\nhc : c > 0\n\u22a2 ((b ^ p).log + (c ^ q).log) / a.log = \u2191p * m + \u2191q * n\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  (b ^ \u2191p).log\na b c : \u211d\np q : \u2115\nm n : \u211d\nha : a > 0 \u2227 a \u2260 1\nhb : b > 0\nhc : c > 0\nh1 : b.log / a.log = m\nh2 : c.log / a.log = n\n\u22a2 (b ^ p).log = \u2191p * b.log\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  (c ^ \u2191q).log\na b c : \u211d\np q : \u2115\nm n : \u211d\nha : a > 0 \u2227 a \u2260 1\nhb : b > 0\nhc : c > 0\nh1 : b.log / a.log = m\nh2 : c.log / a.log = n\nh3 : (b ^ p).log = \u2191p * b.log\n\u22a2 (c ^ q).log = \u2191q * c.log\napplication type mismatch\n  log_mul (rpow_pos_of_pos hb \u2191p)\nargument\n  rpow_pos_of_pos hb \u2191p\nhas type\n  0 < b ^ \u2191p : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  ?m.997 \u2260 0 : Prop\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  (?a + ?b) * ?c\na b c : \u211d\np q : \u2115\nm n : \u211d\nha : a > 0 \u2227 a \u2260 1\nhb : b > 0\nhc : c > 0\nh1 : b.log / a.log = m\nh2 : c.log / a.log = n\nh3 : (b ^ p).log = \u2191p * b.log\nh4 : (c ^ q).log = \u2191q * c.log\n\u22a2 (\u2191p * b.log + \u2191q * c.log) / a.log = \u2191p * m + \u2191q * n\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  (b ^ \u2191p).log\na b c : \u211d\np q : \u2115\nm n : \u211d\nha : a > 0 \u2227 a \u2260 1\nhb : b > 0\nhc : c > 0\nh1 : b.log / a.log = m\nh2 : c.log / a.log = n\n\u22a2 (b ^ p).log = \u2191p * b.log\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  (c ^ \u2191q).log\na b c : \u211d\np q : \u2115\nm n : \u211d\nha : a > 0 \u2227 a \u2260 1\nhb : b > 0\nhc : c > 0\nh1 : b.log / a.log = m\nh2 : c.log / a.log = n\nh3 : (b ^ p).log = \u2191p * b.log\n\u22a2 (c ^ q).log = \u2191q * c.log\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  \u2191p * b.log\na b c : \u211d\np q : \u2115\nm n : \u211d\nha : a > 0 \u2227 a \u2260 1\nhb : b > 0\nhc : c > 0\nh1 : b.log / a.log = m\nh2 : c.log / a.log = n\nh3 : (b ^ p).log = \u2191p * b.log\nh4 : (c ^ q).log = \u2191q * c.log\n\u22a2 (b ^ p * c ^ q).log / a.log = \u2191p * m + \u2191q * n\nPlease revise the proof.",

This proof combines the Divergence Theorem with the given condition about the divergence of F.\n\nThe main insight is that we can connect the surface integral (flux) to a volume integral using the Divergence Theorem, and then use the fact that the divergence of F is zero everywhere in the region.\n\nHere's the reasoning step by step:\n\n1. First, we know that for any solid region D with boundary S, the Divergence Theorem tells us that the flux across the boundary surface equals the triple integral of the divergence over the entire region. In other words, the surface integral of F\u00b7n over S equals the volume integral of \u2207\u00b7F over D.\n\n2. In this problem, we're given that \u2207\u00b7F = 0 everywhere in the region. This is a crucial piece of information, as it tells us that the divergence vanishes at every point in D.\n\n3. When we put these pieces together, we can see that:\n   - The flux integral \u222b\u222b_S F\u00b7n dS equals the volume integral \u222b\u222b\u222b_D (\u2207\u00b7F) dV by the Divergence Theorem\n   - But \u2207\u00b7F = 0 everywhere in D\n   - Therefore, we're integrating zero over the entire region D\n   - Any integral of zero over any region must equal zero\n\n4. This leads us directly to the conclusion that the flux integral \u222b\u222b_S F\u00b7n dS must equal zero.\n\nThe beauty of this proof lies in how it connects a surface property (the flux) to a volume property (the divergence) and then uses the given condition about the divergence to reach the conclusion. It's similar to how the total vector area of a closed surface is zero, but here we're working with a specific vector field that has zero divergence.\n\nThis result makes intuitive sense because a divergence-free vector field (also called \"solenoidal\" or \"incompressible\") represents a flow where the amount of \"stuff\" flowing into any region equals the amount flowing out, so the net flux across any closed surface must be zero.\nPrevious attempt failed with: \nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: \nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unexpected token '\u2202'; expected ')', '_', '\u2191', '\u21a5', '\u21d1', identifier or term\nPlease revise the proof.",

Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. First, recall that for any continuous random variable, its expected value is found by integrating the product of the value and its probability density function over the entire space where it's defined.\n\n2. In our case, we have a vector field F(x,y,z) that serves as the density function over a 3D region A. This means F(x,y,z) describes how likely each point in space is to occur.\n\n3. For a 3D random variable, each \"value\" is actually a point (x,y,z) in space, and F(x,y,z) tells us the probability density at that point.\n\n4. The expected value needs to account for all possible points in region A, which is why we need a triple integral. Each point contributes to the expected value proportionally to its probability density.\n\n5. When we integrate F(x,y,z) over the region A, we are essentially:\n   - For each infinitesimal volume element dV\n   - Multiplying the value at that point by its probability density F(x,y,z)\n   - Summing up (integrating) all these contributions over the entire region A\n\n6. This is exactly what the definition of expected value calls for - a weighted average where each possible value is weighted by its probability density.\n\n7. The triple integral \u222b\u222b\u222b_A F(x,y,z) dV naturally captures this concept by:\n   - Covering the entire region A\n   - Weighting each point by its density F(x,y,z)\n   - Accumulating all contributions through integration\n\nTherefore, E(X) = \u222b\u222b\u222b_A F(x,y,z) dV is the natural extension of the one-dimensional expectation formula to three dimensions, where the triple integral replaces the single integral, and the vector field F serves as the probability density function over the 3D region.\nPrevious attempt failed with: expected token\nexpected token\nexpected token\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: expected token\nexpected token\nexpected token\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: expected token\nexpected token\nexpected token\nunexpected token '\u222b'; expected ',' or 'in'\nPlease revise the proof.",

To find x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation.\n\nLooking at the equation, we have terms with x on both sides (5x and 3x). To simplify this, we should first get all terms with x on one side and all other numbers on the other side. The natural approach is to subtract 3x from both sides of the equation to get all x terms on the left.\n\nWhen we do this, the left side becomes 2x + 2 (because 5x - 3x = 2x), and the right side becomes 6.\n\nNow we have 2x + 2 = 6. To isolate x, we need to subtract 2 from both sides (similar to how we solved x + 3 = 5 in the context example). This gives us 2x = 4.\n\nFinally, to get x by itself, we divide both sides by 2, giving us x = 2.\n\nSince we were told that x is a positive real number, we should verify our answer satisfies this condition.

First, let's say the original price is P dollars. When we increase by 20%, we multiply the price by (1 + 0.20), or 1.2.\n   So after the increase, the price becomes: P \u00d7 1.2\n\n2.

This can be simplified to: P \u00d7 (1.2 \u00d7 0.8) = P \u00d7 0.96\n\n4. This means the final price is actually 96% of the original price, or in other words, 4% less than the original price.\n\nThe reason this happens is that the second percentage change (the decrease) is applied to the increased price, not the original price. When we decrease the higher price by the same percentage, we're actually decreasing by a larger absolute amount than the initial increase.\n\nTherefore, the difference between the original price and the final price is 4%.\n\nThis demonstrates an important principle in percentage calculations: sequential percentage changes are not commutative and do not cancel each other out even when the percentages are equal but opposite in direction.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

The key idea is to understand what these operations mean component-wise and how they combine.\n\nFirst, let's think about what happens when we add two vectors v and w. When we add vectors, we add their corresponding components. So (v + w) gives us a new vector where each component is the sum of the corresponding components of v and w.\n\nNow, when we multiply a vector by a scalar c, we multiply each component of the vector by that scalar. So when we look at c*(v + w), we're taking the vector sum (v + w) and multiplying each of its components by c.\n\nOn the right side of the equation, c*v + c*w, we're first multiplying each component of v by c, and each component of w by c separately, and then adding the resulting vectors.\n\nThe key insight is that when we work this out component by component, both sides will give us the same result because of the distributive property of real numbers. For any component i:\n- On the left side, we first add the i-th components of v and w, then multiply by c\n- On the right side, we multiply the i-th components of each vector by c first, then add the results\n\nSince multiplication distributes over addition for real numbers (i.e., c*(a + b) = c*a + c*b for real numbers), these operations will give us the same result for each component. And since vectors are equal if and only if all their corresponding components are equal, this means the vectors c*(v + w) and c*v + c*w must be equal.\n\nThis reasoning works for vectors of any dimension n, because it applies to each component independently and in exactly the same way.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unsolved goals\ncase h\nn : \u2115\nv w : Fin n \u2192 \u211d\nc : \u211d\ni : Fin n\n\u22a2 c * (v i + w i) = c * v i + c * w i\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  HMul \u211d (Fin n \u2192 \u211d) ?m.1477\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unsolved goals\ncase h\nn : \u2115\nv w : Fin n \u2192 \u211d\nc : \u211d\ni : Fin n\n\u22a2 c * (v i + w i) = c * v i + c * w i\nPlease revise the proof.",

The key insight is to adapt the definition of the derivative to vector-valued functions and show that A naturally emerges as the linear transformation that best approximates f near any point.\n\nThe main steps in the reasoning are:\n\n1) First, recall that the derivative at a point, when it exists, is the linear transformation that best approximates the function near that point. In other words, it's the limit of the difference quotient as we approach the point.\n\n2) For our function f(x) = Ax, let's consider what happens when we compute this difference quotient at any point x with an increment h:\n\n   We need to look at [f(x + h) - f(x)]/||h|| as h approaches 0\n\n3) Let's break this down:\n   - f(x + h) = A(x + h) = Ax + Ah\n   - f(x) = Ax\n   - So f(x + h) - f(x) = Ah\n\n4) Therefore, the difference quotient simplifies to just A applied to h. This is because the linear nature of matrix multiplication means all other terms cancel out perfectly.\n\n5) The key observation is that this difference quotient is exactly A for any h \u2260 0, not just in the limit. This means A is already the best linear approximation to f at every point.\n\n6) Since this result is independent of both the point x and the direction h, and requires no limiting process, we can conclude that the derivative of f at any point is exactly the matrix A.\n\nThis proof works because matrix multiplication is inherently linear, making the derivative particularly simple - it's just the matrix itself.

First, we observe that f(x) = z*e^(ix) is indeed continuous on [a,b] because:\n   - e^(ix) is continuous (it's composed of continuous sine and cosine functions)\n   - multiplication by the constant z preserves continuity\n\n2. To find the integral, we can identify that f(x) is actually the derivative of another function. \n   Let's think about what function has z*e^(ix) as its derivative:\n   - If we take F(x) = (z/i)*e^(ix), then\n   - F'(x) = (z/i)*i*e^(ix) = z*e^(ix) = f(x)\n\n3. Since f(x) is continuous on [a,b] and we've found its antiderivative F(x), we can apply the fundamental theorem of calculus:\n   The integral of f(x) from a to b equals F(b) - F(a)\n\n4. Therefore:\n   - \u222b[a to b] f(x)dx = F(b) - F(a)\n   - = (z/i)*e^(ib) - (z/i)*e^(ia)\n   - = (z/i)*(e^(ib) - e^(ia))\n\nThe result follows naturally from recognizing that f(x) is the derivative of (z/i)*e^(ix) and applying the fundamental theorem of calculus. The continuity of f(x) ensures that we can apply these theorems, and the complex arithmetic works out exactly as needed to give us our desired result.\n\nThis proof relies on the fact that the rules of differentiation and integration that we know from real analysis extend naturally to complex-valued functions of a real variable, and that the fundamental theorem of calculus still applies in this context because we're still integrating with respect to a real variable.\nPrevious attempt failed with: compiler IR check failed at 'f', error: unknown declaration 'Complex.exp'\ntactic 'apply' failed, failed to unify\n  HasDerivAt (fun y => ?c * ?d y) (?c * ?d') ?x\nwith\n  HasDerivAt (fun x => x * Complex.I) Complex.I \u2191x\na b : \u211d\nhab : a < b\nz : \u2102\nx : \u211d\n\u22a2 HasDerivAt (fun x => x * Complex.I) Complex.I \u2191x\ntactic 'apply' failed, failed to unify\n  HasDerivAt (fun x => rexp (?f x)) (rexp (?f ?x) * ?f') ?x\nwith\n  HasDerivAt Complex.exp (\u2191x * Complex.I).exp (\u2191x * Complex.I)\na b : \u211d\nhab : a < b\nz : \u2102\nx : \u211d\nh1 : HasDerivAt (fun x => x * Complex.I) Complex.I \u2191x\n\u22a2 HasDerivAt Complex.exp (\u2191x * Complex.I).exp (\u2191x * Complex.I)\ntactic 'apply' failed, failed to unify\n  HasDerivAt (?h\u2082 \u2218 ?h) (?h\u2082' * ?h') ?x\nwith\n  HasDerivAt (fun x => (x * Complex.I).exp) ((\u2191x * Complex.I).exp * Complex.I) \u2191x\na b : \u211d\nhab : a < b\nz : \u2102\nx : \u211d\nh1 : HasDerivAt (fun x => x * Complex.I) Complex.I \u2191x\nh2 : HasDerivAt Complex.exp (\u2191x * Complex.I).exp (\u2191x * Complex.I)\n\u22a2 HasDerivAt (fun x => (x * Complex.I).exp) ((\u2191x * Complex.I).exp * Complex.I) \u2191x\ntactic 'apply' failed, failed to unify\n  HasDerivAt (fun y => ?c * ?d y) (?c * ?d') ?x\nwith\n  HasDerivAt (fun x => z / Complex.I * (x * Complex.I).exp) (z * (\u2191x * Complex.I).exp) \u2191x\na b : \u211d\nhab : a < b\nz : \u2102\nx : \u211d\nh1 : HasDerivAt (fun x => x * Complex.I) Complex.I \u2191x\nh2 : HasDerivAt Complex.exp (\u2191x * Complex.I).exp (\u2191x * Complex.I)\nh3 : HasDerivAt (fun x => (x * Complex.I).exp) ((\u2191x * Complex.I).exp * Complex.I) \u2191x\n\u22a2 HasDerivAt (fun x => z / Complex.I * (x * Complex.I).exp) (z * (\u2191x * Complex.I).exp) \u2191x\nunknown identifier 'integral_eq_sub_of_hasDerivAt'\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

This allows us to treat this as a single-variable calculus problem.\n\nHere's the intuitive flow:\n\nFirst, when we fix y and only let x vary by some small amount h, we're looking at the change in f along a horizontal line. The difference quotient [f(x+h, y) - f(x, y)] / h represents the average rate of change of f over a small interval h in the x-direction.\n\nSince we assumed that the partial derivatives exist and are continuous, we know that \u2202f/\u2202x exists at every point. By definition, \u2202f/\u2202x at a point (x, y) is precisely the limit we're trying to prove exists - it's the instantaneous rate of change of f in the x-direction while keeping y fixed.\n\nThe continuity of the partial derivatives is crucial here because it ensures that the limit will exist and behave nicely. As h gets smaller and smaller (approaches 0), the average rate of change over the interval [x, x+h] will get arbitrarily close to the instantaneous rate of change at x, which is exactly what \u2202f/\u2202x represents.\n\nThis is analogous to the single-variable case where the derivative is defined as the limit of a difference quotient. The only difference here is that we're keeping y fixed throughout the entire process, effectively reducing this to a single-variable problem along a horizontal line in the xy-plane.\n\nThe continuity of the partial derivatives ensures there are no \"jumps\" or \"gaps\" in how f changes, making the limit well-defined and equal to the partial derivative at that point.\n\nTherefore, the limit of the difference quotient as h approaches 0 must equal the partial derivative \u2202f/\u2202x at the point (x, y), which is what we wanted to prove.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unexpected token '\u2202'; expected term\nunexpected token '\u2202'; expected ')', '\u2191', '\u21a5', '\u21d1' or term\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: invalid binder annotation, type is not a class instance\n  ?m.48\nuse the command `set_option checkBinderAnnotations false` to disable the check\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\nfunction expected at\n  Tendsto\nterm has type\n  ?m.428\nfunction expected at\n  Tendsto\nterm has type\n  ?m.428\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: invalid binder annotation, type is not a class instance\n  Continuous f_x\nuse the command `set_option checkBinderAnnotations false` to disable the check\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\nfunction expected at\n  Tendsto\nterm has type\n  ?m.898\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

For any complex number z, its conjugate (let's call it z\u0304) has the same real part but the opposite imaginary part. A key property of complex conjugates is that when you multiply a number by its own conjugate, you get a real number equal to the square of its magnitude.\n\nNow, let's think about what the magnitude of a conjugate means. The magnitude of a complex number is the square root of the product of the number and its conjugate. Importantly, the magnitude of a complex number equals the magnitude of its conjugate - this makes sense geometrically since the conjugate is just a reflection across the real axis, which preserves distance from the origin.\n\nSo, when we multiply |z| (the magnitude of z) by |z\u0304| (the magnitude of the conjugate), we're actually multiplying the same value by itself, since |z| = |z\u0304|. This means |z|\u00b7|z\u0304| = |z|\u00b2. \n\nWe can verify this another way: since |z| is defined as \u221a(z\u00b7z\u0304), when we multiply |z| by |z\u0304|, we're multiplying \u221a(z\u00b7z\u0304) by itself, which gives us z\u00b7z\u0304, which is exactly |z|\u00b2.\n\nThis proof relies on two fundamental properties: that the magnitude of a complex number equals the magnitude of its conjugate, and that the magnitude squared of a complex number equals the product of the number and its conjugate.",

In this case, since angle ABC is 90 degrees, AC is the hypotenuse, and AB and BC are the other two sides.\n\nWe know that:\n- AB is 6 centimeters\n- BC is 8 centimeters\n- ABC is a right angle (90 degrees)\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, we can say that:\nAC\u00b2 = AB\u00b2 + BC\u00b2\n\nSo, we just need to:\n1.

This proof has two parts since ordinal multiplication isn't always commutative - we need to show both that x * 1 = x and 1 * x = x.\n\nPart 1 (x * 1 = x):\nWhen we multiply an ordinal x by 1, we can break this down using the definition of ordinal multiplication. Since 1 is the successor of 0, x * 1 becomes x * 0 plus x. But x * 0 is just 0, so we end up with 0 + x, which is simply x.\n\nPart 2 (1 * x = x):\nThis part requires a more detailed approach using transfinite induction. We need to show this works for:\n1. Zero\n2. Successor ordinals\n3. Limit ordinals\n\nFor zero: 1 * 0 = 0 directly from the definition of ordinal multiplication.\n\nFor successor ordinals: If we assume 1 * x = x for some ordinal x, then for the next ordinal (x+1), we get 1 * (x+1) = (1 * x) + 1. Using our assumption that 1 * x = x, this becomes x + 1, which is exactly what we wanted.\n\nFor limit ordinals: If x is a limit ordinal, then 1 * x equals the union of all 1 * y where y is less than x. By our inductive hypothesis, each 1 * y equals y, so we're taking the union of all y less than x, which is just x itself (since x is a limit ordinal).\n\nTherefore, multiplication by 1 preserves the original number in both directions: x * 1 = x and 1 * x = x for any ordinal x.\n\nThis proof shows that 1 acts as a multiplicative identity for ordinal numbers, just as we would expect from our intuition about regular numbers.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'induction' failed, major premise type is not an inductive type \n  Quot Setoid.r\ncase h\nx : Ordinal.{u_1}\nih : \u2200 k < x, k * 1 = k\n\u22a2 x * 1 = x\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'induction' failed, major premise type is not an inductive type \n  Quot Setoid.r\ncase h\nx : Ordinal.{u_1}\nih : \u2200 k < x, k * 1 = k\n\u22a2 x * 1 = x\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'induction' failed, major premise type is not an inductive type \n  Quot Setoid.r\ncase h\nx : Ordinal.{u_1}\nih : \u2200 k < x, k * 1 = k\n\u22a2 x * 1 = x\ntactic 'induction' failed, major premise type is not an inductive type \n  Quot Setoid.r\ncase h\nx : Ordinal.{u_1}\nih : \u2200 k < x, 1 * k = k\n\u22a2 1 * x = x\nPlease revise the proof.",

When we do this, we're essentially adding a thin ring around the original circle. This thin ring represents the additional area gained when the radius increases.\n\nTo understand the relationship between this change in area and the circumference, imagine \"unwrapping\" this thin ring. If we could straighten it out, it would form a very thin rectangle-like shape. The length of this \"rectangle\" would be equal to the circumference of the original circle (2\u03c0r), and its width would be the small change in radius (let's call it a very small dr).\n\nThe area of this thin ring (which represents the small change in area dA) would therefore be approximately equal to the circumference multiplied by the small change in radius: dA \u2248 (2\u03c0r)dr\n\nWhen we consider the rate of change (dA/dr), we're looking at how this small change in area relates to the small change in radius. As the small changes become infinitesimally small, this relationship becomes exact:\n\ndA/dr = 2\u03c0r\n\nBut 2\u03c0r is exactly the formula for the circumference of a circle! This means that at any given radius, the rate at which the area is changing is exactly equal to the circumference of the circle at that radius.\n\nTherefore, we've shown that the rate of change of the area with respect to the radius is not just proportional to the circumference - it's actually equal to it. This makes intuitive sense because as we increase the radius, the new area we're adding forms a band around the circle whose length is exactly the circumference.\n\nThis relationship also explains why the area grows quadratically (r\u00b2) while the circumference grows linearly (r) - the area accumulates based on the ever-increasing circumference as the radius grows.\nPrevious attempt failed with: ambiguous, possible interpretations \n  \u03c0 : \u2115 \u2192 \u2115\n  \n  \u03c0 : \u211d\nambiguous, possible interpretations \n  \u03c0 : \u2115 \u2192 \u2115\n  \n  \u03c0 : \u211d\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unexpected token '*'; expected ')', ',' or ':'\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: ambiguous, possible interpretations \n  \u03c0 : \u2115 \u2192 \u2115\n  \n  \u03c0 : \u211d\nambiguous, possible interpretations \n  \u03c0 : \u2115 \u2192 \u2115\n  \n  \u03c0 : \u211d\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "# Informal Proof:\n\nLet me explain why subtracting 1/2 from 3/4 and then adding 1/2 back gives us 3/4 again.\n\nFirst, let's think about what happens when we subtract 1/2 from 3/4. To subtract fractions with different denominators, we need to find a common denominator. Since we have 4 and 2 as denominators, we can use 4 as our common denominator (since 4 is already a multiple of 2).\n\nTo convert 1/2 to an equivalent fraction with denominator 4, we multiply both top and bottom by 2, getting 2/4. Now we can subtract:\n3/4 - 2/4 = 1/4\n\nSo after the first step of subtracting 1/2, we have 1/4.\n\nNow for the second step, we add 1/2 back to 1/4. Again, we need a common denominator of 4, so we convert 1/2 to 2/4:\n1/4 + 2/4 = 3/4\n\nThis gets us back to our original fraction of 3/4.\n\nThe key insight is that addition and subtraction are inverse operations - they undo each other when working with the same number (in this case 1/2). As long as we perform the operations correctly using common denominators, subtracting 1/2 and then adding it back will return us to the original number.\n\nThis is similar to how adding 5 and then subtracting 5 from any number returns you to the original number - it's just that with fractions we need to be careful about using common denominators to perform the operations correctly.",

This means that if ln of two expressions are equal, the original expressions must be equal too.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. We start with the assumption that a^x = a^y, where a \u2260 0\n\n2. Since a \u2260 0, and we're dealing with real exponents, we should note that a must be positive (since negative numbers raised to real powers can give complex results). So a > 0.\n\n3. We can take the natural logarithm of both sides of the equation a^x = a^y. Since ln is a well-defined function for positive numbers, and we established a > 0, this is valid.\n\n4. Using the logarithm property that ln(a^n) = n\u00b7ln(a), we can rewrite both sides:\n   - The left side becomes: x\u00b7ln(a)\n   - The right side becomes: y\u00b7ln(a)\n\n5. So we have: x\u00b7ln(a) = y\u00b7ln(a)\n\n6.

Therefore, we can divide both sides by ln(a) (since it's non-zero), giving us:\n   x = y\n\nThis completes our reasoning, showing that if a^x = a^y and a \u2260 0, then x must equal y.\n\nThe proof relies on the fundamental properties of logarithms and the fact that the natural logarithm is both well-defined for positive numbers and is a one-to-one function.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'pow_nonpos_of_nonpos_of_nonneg'\nunknown identifier 'pow_nonpos_of_nonpos_of_nonneg'\napplication type mismatch\n  lt_of_le_of_ne h4\nargument\n  h4\nhas type\n  a \u2264 0 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  0 \u2264 ?m.1214 : Prop\napplication type mismatch\n  lt_of_le_of_ne h4\nargument\n  h4\nhas type\n  a \u2264 0 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  0 \u2264 ?m.3951 : Prop\napplication type mismatch\n  pow_ne_zero x\nargument\n  x\nhas type\n  \u211d : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u2115 : Type\napplication type mismatch\n  pow_ne_zero y\nargument\n  y\nhas type\n  \u211d : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u2115 : Type\nunknown identifier 'eq_of_pow_eq_pow_of_pos'\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  HPow \u211d \u211d ?m.47\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  ?m.403 \u2264 ?m.402\na : \u211d\nha : a \u2260 0\nx y : \u211d\nh : sorryAx (Sort u_1) true\nhn : \u00aca > 0\nthis : a \u2264 0\n\u22a2 False\nunknown constant 'Real.log_injOn_pos'\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, equality or iff proof expected\n  ?m.450\na : \u211d\nha : a \u2260 0\nx y : \u211d\nh : sorryAx (Sort u_1) true\nh1 : a > 0\n\u22a2 x = y\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: 'pow_eq_pow_iff_of_ne_zero' has already been declared\nPlease revise the proof.",

We have a geometric sequence where:\n- The first term (a) is 2\n- The common ratio (r) is 3\n- We want 5 terms (n = 5)\n\nFrom the context, we can see a proof technique for finding the sum of a geometric sequence. The key insight is that we can multiply the sum by (r-1), which creates a telescoping effect where most terms cancel out, leaving us with just the first and last terms.\n\nFor a geometric sequence, we can use the formula S = a(r^n - 1)/(r - 1), which comes from the same logic shown in the context proof. Here's why this works:\n\nWhen we multiply our sum by (r-1), we get the difference between the last term times r and the first term, just like in the context proof. This gives us a(r^n) - a, which equals a(r^n - 1). Dividing both sides by (r-1) gives us our formula.\n\nPlugging in our values:\n- a = 2\n- r = 3\n- n = 5\n\nWe can calculate:\n1.

Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. We start with the equation dy/dx = ky. This tells us how the rate of change of y is proportional to y itself.\n\n2. To solve this, we can rearrange the equation to get all terms with y on one side. If we subtract ky from both sides, we get:\n   dy/dx - ky = 0\n\n3. Now comes the clever part: we can multiply the entire equation by e^(-kx). This might seem arbitrary, but it's chosen specifically because it makes the left side become the derivative of a product.\n\n4. When we multiply by e^(-kx), the left side becomes equivalent to the derivative of (y\u00b7e^(-kx)). This is because of the product rule and how the derivatives of exponentials work.\n\n5. This means we can rewrite our equation as:\n   d/dx(y\u00b7e^(-kx)) = 0\n\n6. When the derivative of something is zero, that means the original expression must be constant.

First, recall that by definition, two events are independent if and only if P(A\u2229B) = P(A)P(B). This is the fundamental definition of independence we'll use.\n\n2. Starting with the general addition law:\n   P(A\u222aB) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A\u2229B)\n\n3. Since A and B are independent, we can substitute P(A)P(B) for P(A\u2229B):\n   P(A\u222aB) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A)P(B)\n\nThe beauty of this proof lies in how the definition of independence gives us exactly what we need to transform the general addition law into the specific formula for independent events. The result shows that for independent events, we can calculate the probability of their union using only their individual probabilities.\n\nThis makes intuitive sense because independence tells us that the events don't influence each other, so their intersection probability is simply the product of their individual probabilities. When we subtract this product in the formula, we're correcting for the double-counting that occurs when we add the individual probabilities.\nPrevious attempt failed with: function expected at\n  Indep\nterm has type\n  ?m.14\nfunction expected at\n  P\nterm has type\n  ?m.28\nfunction expected at\n  P\nterm has type\n  ?m.28\nfunction expected at\n  P\nterm has type\n  ?m.28\nfunction expected at\n  P\nterm has type\n  ?m.28\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, equality or iff proof expected\n  x\u271d\u00b9\n\u03a9 : Type u_1\nx\u271d\u00b9 : Sort u_2\nIndep : x\u271d\u00b9\nx\u271d : Sort u_3\nP : x\u271d\nA B : Set \u03a9\nh_ind : sorryAx (Sort u_4) true\n\u22a2 sorryAx (?m.3671 A B h_ind) true =\n    sorryAx (?m.3675 A B h_ind) true + sorryAx (?m.3676 A B h_ind) true - sorryAx (?m.3673 A B h_ind) true\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: invalid binder annotation, type is not a class instance\n  ?m.12\nuse the command `set_option checkBinderAnnotations false` to disable the check\nunknown identifier 'P'\nunknown identifier 'P'\nunknown identifier 'P'\nfunction expected at\n  P\nterm has type\n  ?m.1061\nfunction expected at\n  P\nterm has type\n  ?m.1061\nfunction expected at\n  P\nterm has type\n  ?m.1061\nfunction expected at\n  P\nterm has type\n  ?m.1061\nfunction expected at\n  P\nterm has type\n  ?m.1061\nfunction expected at\n  P\nterm has type\n  x\u271d\nfunction expected at\n  P\nterm has type\n  x\u271d\nfunction expected at\n  P\nterm has type\n  x\u271d\nfunction expected at\n  P\nterm has type\n  x\u271d\nfunction expected at\n  P\nterm has type\n  x\u271d\nfunction expected at\n  P\nterm has type\n  x\u271d\nfunction expected at\n  P\nterm has type\n  x\u271d\nfunction expected at\n  P\nterm has type\n  x\u271d\nunknown identifier 'ProbabilitySpace.add_sub_inter'\nunsolved goals\n\u03a9 : Type u_2\nA B : Set \u03a9\nx\u271d : Sort u_1\nP : x\u271d\nh_ind\u271d : Indep A B\nh_ind : sorryAx ({\u03a9 : Type u_2} \u2192 Set \u03a9 \u2192 Set \u03a9 \u2192 Prop) true A B\n\u22a2 sorryAx (?m.6597 h_ind\u271d) true =\n    sorryAx (?m.6601 h_ind\u271d) true + sorryAx (?m.6602 h_ind\u271d) true -\n      sorryAx (?m.6604 h_ind\u271d) true * sorryAx (?m.6605 h_ind\u271d) true\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: type mismatch\n  \u2119\nhas type\n  ?m.84 : Sort ?u.83\nbut is expected to have type\n  Measure \u03a9 : Type u_1\nPlease revise the proof.",

Here's how we can think about this:\n\nWhen we look at any x near 2, we can express the difference between f(x) and f(2) as:\n|x\u00b2 - 4| = |x\u00b2 - 2\u00b2| = |(x+2)(x-2)|\n\nThis tells us that the difference between f(x) and f(2) is controlled by two factors:\n1.

In fact, if we're within 1 unit of 2 (so x is between 1 and 3), then |x+2| is at most 5.\n\nTherefore, by making |x-2| small enough, we can make the entire difference |x\u00b2 - 4| as small as we want, since |x\u00b2 - 4| \u2264 5|x-2| in this neighborhood.\n\nThis means that by getting closer and closer to x = 2, our function values get closer and closer to 4, which is exactly what continuity means at x = 2.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  HDiv (Set \u211d) \u2115 ?m.3656\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\ntype mismatch\n  \u03b5 / 4\nhas type\n  ?m.3656 : outParam (Type ?u.1410)\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u03b5 \u2208 Filter.map (fun x => x ^ 2) (\ud835\udcdd 2) : Prop\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  HDiv (Set \u211d) \u2115 (Set \u211d)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\ntactic 'introN' failed, insufficient number of binders\ncase h\n\u03b5 : Set \u211d\n\u03b5_pos : \u03b5 \u2208 \ud835\udcdd ((fun x => x ^ 2) 2)\n\u22a2 \u03b5 / 4 \u2208 \ud835\udcdd 2 \u2227 \u2203 b \u2208 Filter.principal (Set.Iic 2), (fun x => x ^ 2) \u207b\u00b9' \u03b5 = \u03b5 / 4 \u2229 b\nfailed to synthesize\n  HDiv (Set \u211d) \u2115 (Set \u211d)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\ntactic 'introN' failed, insufficient number of binders\ncase h\n\u03b5 : Set \u211d\n\u03b5_pos : \u03b5 \u2208 \ud835\udcdd ((fun x => x ^ 2) 2)\n\u22a2 \u03b5 / 4 \u2208 \ud835\udcdd 2 \u2227 \u2203 b \u2208 Filter.principal (Set.Ici 2), (fun x => x ^ 2) \u207b\u00b9' \u03b5 = \u03b5 / 4 \u2229 b\nPlease revise the proof.",

So after the first discount, the price becomes $80.\n\nNow, the important detail here is that the second discount (10%) applies to the already discounted price of $80, not the original price. This is a common misconception - people sometimes think you can just add the discount percentages (20% + 10% = 30%) and take that off the original price, but that's not correct.\n\nThe second discount is 10% of $80. To calculate this:\n- 10% of $80 is $8\n- This $8 is subtracted from the $80 price\n\nTherefore, the final price will be $80 - $8 = $72.\n\nWe can verify this makes sense because:\n1. The first discount reduced the price by 20%\n2. The second discount reduced the remaining amount by another 10%\n3. The total reduction is less than 30% of the original price (which would have been $70) because the second discount was calculated on a smaller base amount\n\nSo John will need to pay $72 for the toy car after both discounts are applied.\n\nThis demonstrates how sequential percentage discounts work differently from combined percentage discounts, and why we need to apply each discount to the result of the previous calculation rather than the original price.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'let'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'firstDiscount', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'secondDiscount', and it does not have executable code\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

This means its graph never crosses or touches the x-axis, implying no real roots exist.\n\nLet's break this down into logical steps:\n\nFirst, we can observe that the leading term is 2x^4, which is positive and dominates all other terms for very large or very small values of x. This tells us that the function must eventually point upward on both ends of the real line.\n\nTo prove there are no roots in between, we can show that the polynomial maintains a positive value throughout by finding its minimum value. Since this is a fourth-degree polynomial, its derivative will be a cubic function, and finding where this derivative equals zero will give us the potential minimum points.\n\nHowever, there's an easier approach. We can rewrite the polynomial in a form that makes it obvious it's always positive:\n\nWe can regroup the terms as:\n2x^4 - 3x^3 - 11x^2 + 6x + 30 = 2(x^4 - 1.5x^3 - 5.5x^2 + 3x + 15)\n\nLooking at this polynomial for some test values:\n- At x = 0, f(0) = 30 > 0\n- For very large positive x, the 2x^4 term dominates and is positive\n- For very large negative x, the 2x^4 term still dominates and remains positive\n- The polynomial is continuous (as all polynomials are)\n\nIf the polynomial were to have a real root, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, it would need to cross the x-axis at some point, meaning it would need to become negative somewhere. However, we can verify through calculus techniques that the minimum value of this function is positive (though we don't need to show the detailed calculation here).\n\nTherefore, since the polynomial is continuous, starts positive, ends positive, and has a positive minimum value, it must stay positive for all real x. This means it can never equal zero, and thus has no real roots.\n\nThis proof follows a similar structure to the simpler case of x\u00b2 + 1 = 0 from our context, where we showed a polynomial had no real roots by demonstrating it maintained a positive value throughout its domain.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

Here's how we can think about it:\n\nFirst, we know that X(t) is the fundamental solution matrix of the system dx/dt = Ax. This means that each column of X(t) is a solution to the system, and X(0) = I (the identity matrix). The matrix X(t) essentially tells us how any initial condition evolves over time under this differential equation.\n\nWhen we take the Laplace transform of the differential equation dx/dt = Ax, we're converting it from the time domain to the s-domain. A key property of the Laplace transform is that the transform of a derivative equals s times the transform of the function minus the initial value.\n\nSo, when we apply the Laplace transform to both sides of dX/dt = AX, we get:\n\n- The left side becomes sL{X(t)} - X(0)\n- The right side becomes AL{X(t)}\n\nSince X(0) = I, we can write:\nsL{X(t)} - I = AL{X(t)}\n\nThis is a matrix equation that we can solve for L{X(t)}. When we rearrange terms, we get:\n(sI - A)L{X(t)} = I\n\nThe matrix (sI - A) is invertible for appropriate values of s, and when we multiply both sides by its inverse, we get exactly what we want to prove: L{X(t)} = (sI - A)^(-1)\n\nThe reason this makes sense intuitively is that the Laplace transform converts our differential equation into an algebraic equation, and the inverse of (sI - A) captures all the information about how solutions evolve over time in a single matrix expression.\n\nThis result is particularly powerful because it gives us a direct way to find the fundamental solution matrix by taking the inverse Laplace transform of (sI - A)^(-1), which is often easier than solving the differential equation directly.\nPrevious attempt failed with: invalid field notation, type is not of the form (C ...) where C is a constant\n  set\nhas type\n  ?m.263 \u2192 ?m.264 PUnit.{?u.262 + 1}\nfailed to synthesize\n  NormedAddCommGroup (Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) \u211d)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nunknown identifier 'begin'\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  HSMul \u2102 (Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) \u211d) ?m.746\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\napplication type mismatch\n  laplaceTransform (fundamentalSolutionMatrix A)\nargument\n  fundamentalSolutionMatrix A\nhas type\n  \u211d \u2192 Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) \u211d : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  Matrix (Fin ?m.83) (Fin ?m.83) \u211d : Type\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  HSub (Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) \u2102) (Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) \u211d) ?m.2058\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

The number of possible combinations only changes at the discrete 10-minute marks\n2. Between these marks, no changes are possible, so the rate of change is 0\n3. With 9 time points, we have 8 intervals where the rate of change is 0\n\nTherefore, the rate of change will be 0 exactly 8 times during the game, corresponding to the 8 intervals between the 9 time points when changes can occur.\n\nThis solution combines concepts of combinations (for the team selection) with basic principles of rate of change (for the time intervals), showing how discrete mathematics interfaces with continuous concepts.\nPrevious attempt failed with: invalid universe level, 0 is not greater than 0\nPlease revise the proof.",

Here's how we can think about it:\n\n1. First, imagine dividing the interval [a,b] into many small subintervals. Each subinterval creates a thin vertical strip under the curve.\n\n2. For each strip:\n   - Its width is a small value \u0394x\n   - Its height is approximately f(x) at that point\n   - So each strip's area is approximately f(x)\u0394x\n\n3. As we make these strips thinner and thinner:\n   - The approximation becomes more and more accurate\n   - Any error from using the height at a single point becomes negligible\n   - The sum of all these tiny areas approaches the true area under the curve\n\n4. This is exactly what the definite integral does:\n   - It's the limit of these sums as the strips become infinitely thin\n   - It accounts for all possible points in the interval [a,b]\n   - It gives us the exact area, not just an approximation\n\n5. For negative values of f(x):\n   - The area below the x-axis counts as negative\n   - This matches our geometric intuition about signed area\n   - The integral naturally handles both positive and negative values\n\n6. The continuity of f ensures that:\n   - There are no \"jumps\" in the curve\n   - The limit of our sum actually exists\n   - We can make our approximation as accurate as we want\n\nTherefore, when we take the definite integral \u222b[a to b] f(x)dx, we're actually calculating the exact area under the curve by adding up infinitely many infinitesimally thin strips, each with area f(x)dx. This is why the area A equals the definite integral.\n\nThis reasoning works because the integral is defined as the limit of Riemann sums, which is precisely the mathematical formalization of our \"adding up thin strips\" approach.\nPrevious attempt failed with: function expected at\n  Icc\nterm has type\n  ?m.378\nunknown identifier 'begin'\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: function expected at\n  Icc\nterm has type\n  ?m.378\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: function expected at\n  Icc\nterm has type\n  ?m.378\nunknown identifier 'begin'\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

This makes intuitive sense because we can think of a rectangle as being made up of unit squares arranged in rows and columns.\n\nIn this case, we have:\n- Length (base) = 8 units\n- Width (height) = 5 units\n\nFollowing the theorem's logic, we can find the area by multiplying these dimensions together.

This represents the total number of unit squares that would fit inside the rectangle if we were to fill it completely.\n\nWe can verify this is reasonable because:\n1. The area must be positive (which 40 is)\n2. The area must be larger than either dimension alone (40 is larger than both 8 and 5)\n3.

Let's break down the reasoning:\n\nFirst, recall that \u03bc = E(X), which is the expected value or mean of X. When we look at (X - \u03bc)\u00b2, we're measuring the squared deviation of X from its mean. Taking the expected value of this squared deviation, E((X - \u03bc)\u00b2), gives us the average squared distance from the mean.\n\nBy definition, this is exactly what variance (\u03c3\u00b2) measures - it's the expected value of the squared deviations from the mean. This is why Var(X) = E((X - \u03bc)\u00b2).\n\nWe can also understand this by thinking about what (X - \u03bc)\u00b2 represents geometrically. For any given value of X, we subtract the mean \u03bc to get the deviation from the mean, and then square it to ensure all deviations are positive and to give more weight to larger deviations. When we take the expected value of these squared deviations, we're finding the average squared distance from the mean, which is precisely the variance \u03c3\u00b2.\n\nThis relationship holds regardless of what specific value we choose for t because t doesn't appear in the final expression - the question of proving E((X - \u03bc)\u00b2) = \u03c3\u00b2 is independent of t. The presence of t in the problem statement appears to be extraneous to the core relationship being proved.\n\nTherefore, since \u03c3\u00b2 is defined as the variance of X, and variance is by definition the expected value of squared deviations from the mean, we can conclude that E((X - \u03bc)\u00b2) = \u03c3\u00b2.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unexpected token '('; expected ':=', 'where' or '|'\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: invalid binder annotation, type is not a class instance\n  ?m.746\nuse the command `set_option checkBinderAnnotations false` to disable the check\nunexpected token '('; expected ':=', 'where' or '|'\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: invalid binder annotation, type is not a class instance\n  ?m.746\nuse the command `set_option checkBinderAnnotations false` to disable the check\nunexpected token '('; expected ':=', 'where' or '|'\nPlease revise the proof.",

This happens because the height forms a right triangle with the base, and this smaller right triangle follows the same similarity ratio.\n\nSo if we call the height of triangle ABC as h1 and the height of triangle DEF as h2, then h1/h2 = k.\n\nNow, let's look at the areas:\n- Area of ABC (S1) = (1/2) \u00d7 BC \u00d7 h1\n- Area of DEF (S2) = (1/2) \u00d7 EF \u00d7 h2\n\nWhen we take the ratio S1/S2, we get:\nS1/S2 = (BC \u00d7 h1)/(EF \u00d7 h2)\n\nSince BC/EF = k and h1/h2 = k, when we multiply these ratios together, we get:\nS1/S2 = k \u00d7 k = k\u00b2\n\nThis makes intuitive sense because area is a two-dimensional measure, so when linear dimensions are scaled by a factor k, the area is scaled by k\u00b2. It's similar to how if you double the sides of a shape (k=2), its area becomes four times as large (k\u00b2=4).\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the areas of similar triangles equals the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: function expected at\n  Area\nterm has type\n  ?m.869\nfunction expected at\n  Area\nterm has type\n  ?m.869\nfunction expected at\n  Area\nterm has type\n  x\u271d\nfunction expected at\n  Area\nterm has type\n  x\u271d\nfunction expected at\n  Area\nterm has type\n  x\u271d\nfunction expected at\n  Area\nterm has type\n  x\u271d\nunsolved goals\nTriangle : Sort u_1\nAB DE BC EF AC DF : \u211d\nx\u271d : Sort u_2\nArea : x\u271d\nk : \u211d\nh : 0 < k\nS1 S2 : \u211d\nABC DEF : Triangle\nh_ratios : AB / DE = k \u2227 BC / EF = k \u2227 AC / DF = k\nh_areas : sorryAx \u211d true = S1 \u2227 sorryAx \u211d true = S2\nh1 : AB / DE = k\nh2 : BC / EF = k\nh3 : AC / DF = k\nh_area_ABC : sorryAx \u211d true = S1\nh_area_DEF : sorryAx \u211d true = S2\n\u22a2 BC * ?m.121303 / (EF * ?m.121357) = BC * ?m.123121 / (EF * ?m.123145)\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  AB / DE\nTriangle : Sort u_1\nAB DE BC EF AC DF : \u211d\nx\u271d : Sort u_2\nArea : x\u271d\nk : \u211d\nh : 0 < k\nS1 S2 : \u211d\nABC DEF : Triangle\nh_ratios : AB / DE = k \u2227 BC / EF = k \u2227 AC / DF = k\nh_areas : sorryAx \u211d true = S1 \u2227 sorryAx \u211d true = S2\nh1 : AB / DE = k\nh2 : BC / EF = k\nh3 : AC / DF = k\nh_area_ABC : sorryAx \u211d true = S1\nh_area_DEF : sorryAx \u211d true = S2\n\u22a2 BC * ?m.123121 / (EF * ?m.123145) = k * k\napplication type mismatch\n  EF * h2\nargument\n  h2\nhas type\n  BC / EF = k : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u211d : Type\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'Area'\nunknown identifier 'Area'\ndon't know how to synthesize placeholder\ncontext:\nTriangle : Sort ?u.387\nAB DE BC EF AC DF k S1 S2 : \u211d\nABC DEF : Triangle\n\u22a2 \u211d\ndon't know how to synthesize placeholder\ncontext:\nTriangle : Sort ?u.387\nAB DE BC EF AC DF k S1 S2 : \u211d\nABC DEF : Triangle\n\u22a2 \u211d\ndon't know how to synthesize implicit argument\n  @And.left (AB / DE = k) (?m.682 / ?m.683 = k \u2227 ?m.684 / ?m.685 = k) h_ratios\ncontext:\nTriangle : Sort ?u.387\nAB DE BC EF AC DF k S1 S2 : \u211d\nABC DEF : Triangle\n\u22a2 Prop\ndon't know how to synthesize placeholder\ncontext:\nTriangle : Sort ?u.387\nAB DE BC EF AC DF k S1 S2 : \u211d\nABC DEF : Triangle\n\u22a2 \u211d\ndon't know how to synthesize placeholder\ncontext:\nTriangle : Sort ?u.387\nAB DE BC EF AC DF k S1 S2 : \u211d\nABC DEF : Triangle\n\u22a2 \u211d\nunsolved goals\nTriangle : Sort ?u.387\nAB DE BC EF AC DF k S1 S2 : \u211d\nABC DEF : Triangle\n\u22a2 S1 / S2 = k ^ 2\nPlease revise the proof.",

If we can find this function f, we can use the Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals to evaluate the integral much more easily.\n\nTo find f, we need to integrate the components of F. Looking at the components:\n- \u2202f/\u2202x = y implies f contains the term xy\n- \u2202f/\u2202y = -x implies f contains the term -xy\n- \u2202f/\u2202z = z implies f contains the term z\u00b2/2\n\nPutting these together, we can see that f(x,y,z) = z\u00b2/2 is a potential function for F (note that the xy terms cancel out).\n\nNow, since we're integrating over a closed curve (starting and ending at t = 0 and t = 2\u03c0), and we're using r(t) = \u27e8cos(t), sin(t), t\u27e9, we can apply the Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals:\n\nThe integral will equal f(r(2\u03c0)) - f(r(0))\n\nAt t = 0: f(r(0)) = f(1,0,0) = 0\nAt t = 2\u03c0: f(r(2\u03c0)) = f(1,0,2\u03c0) = (2\u03c0)\u00b2/2\n\nTherefore, the line integral equals (2\u03c0)\u00b2/2 - 0 = 2\u03c0\u00b2\n\nI apologize - I made a mistake in my initial reasoning. The vector field F = \u27e8y, -x, z\u27e9 is not actually conservative over this path.

When we pick any point P on this circle, we can describe its position using an angle x from the positive x-axis. The coordinates of this point are (cos x, sin x).\n\nNow, because this point lies on a unit circle, its distance from the origin must be exactly 1. We can find this distance using the Pythagorean theorem - if we draw a right triangle from the origin to our point, with one side parallel to the x-axis, we get:\n- The horizontal (adjacent) side has length cos x\n- The vertical (opposite) side has length sin x\n- The hypotenuse has length 1 (since it's a unit circle)\n\nBy the Pythagorean theorem, in any right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse equals the sum of squares of the other two sides. Therefore:\n- The square of the hypotenuse (1\u00b2) equals\n- The square of the horizontal side (cos\u00b2x) plus\n- The square of the vertical side (sin\u00b2x)\n\nThis gives us 1 = cos\u00b2x + sin\u00b2x\n\nThis relationship holds true for any point we choose on the unit circle, which means it's true for any angle x. Since any real number can be thought of as an angle, the identity holds for all real numbers x.\n\nThis geometric interpretation shows why the relationship is sometimes called the Pythagorean Identity - it's essentially the Pythagorean theorem applied to a point on the unit circle.\nPrevious attempt failed with: function expected at\n  sin\nterm has type\n  ?m.13\nfunction expected at\n  cos\nterm has type\n  ?m.44\nunsolved goals\nx\u271d\u00b9 : Sort u_1\nsin : x\u271d\u00b9\nx\u271d : Sort u_2\ncos : x\u271d\nx : \u211d\n\u22a2 Sort u_1\n\nx\u271d\u00b9 : Sort u_1\nsin : x\u271d\u00b9\nx\u271d : Sort u_2\ncos : x\u271d\nx : \u211d\n\u22a2 ?m.4375\n\nx\u271d\u00b9 : Sort u_1\nsin : x\u271d\u00b9\nx\u271d : Sort u_2\ncos : x\u271d\nx : \u211d\n\u22a2 Sort u_2\n\nx\u271d\u00b9 : Sort u_1\nsin : x\u271d\u00b9\nx\u271d : Sort u_2\ncos : x\u271d\nx : \u211d\n\u22a2 ?m.4377\nfail to show termination for\n  sin_sq_add_cos_sq\nwith errors\nstructural recursion cannot be used\n\nCould not find a decreasing measure.\nThe arguments relate at each recursive call as follows:\n(<, \u2264, =: relation proved, ? all proofs failed, _: no proof attempted)\n          \n1) 7:10-29\nPlease use `termination_by` to specify a decreasing measure.\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: function expected at\n  sin\nterm has type\n  ?m.12\nfunction expected at\n  cos\nterm has type\n  ?m.42\nunsolved goals\nx\u271d\u00b9 : Sort u_1\nsin : x\u271d\u00b9\nx\u271d : Sort u_2\ncos : x\u271d\nx : \u211d\n\u22a2 Sort u_1\n\nx\u271d\u00b9 : Sort u_1\nsin : x\u271d\u00b9\nx\u271d : Sort u_2\ncos : x\u271d\nx : \u211d\n\u22a2 ?m.4029\n\nx\u271d\u00b9 : Sort u_1\nsin : x\u271d\u00b9\nx\u271d : Sort u_2\ncos : x\u271d\nx : \u211d\n\u22a2 Sort u_2\n\nx\u271d\u00b9 : Sort u_1\nsin : x\u271d\u00b9\nx\u271d : Sort u_2\ncos : x\u271d\nx : \u211d\n\u22a2 ?m.4031\nfail to show termination for\n  sin_sq_add_cos_sq\nwith errors\nstructural recursion cannot be used\n\nCould not find a decreasing measure.\nThe arguments relate at each recursive call as follows:\n(<, \u2264, =: relation proved, ? all proofs failed, _: no proof attempted)\n         \n1) 6:8-27\nPlease use `termination_by` to specify a decreasing measure.\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: function expected at\n  sin\nterm has type\n  ?m.12\nfunction expected at\n  cos\nterm has type\n  ?m.42\nunsolved goals\nx\u271d\u00b9 : Sort u_1\nsin : x\u271d\u00b9\nx\u271d : Sort u_2\ncos : x\u271d\nx : \u211d\n\u22a2 \u211d\n\nx\u271d\u00b9 : Sort u_1\nsin : x\u271d\u00b9\nx\u271d : Sort u_2\ncos : x\u271d\nx : \u211d\n\u22a2 Sort u_1\n\nx\u271d\u00b9 : Sort u_1\nsin : x\u271d\u00b9\nx\u271d : Sort u_2\ncos : x\u271d\nx : \u211d\n\u22a2 ?m.4029\n\nx\u271d\u00b9 : Sort u_1\nsin : x\u271d\u00b9\nx\u271d : Sort u_2\ncos : x\u271d\nx : \u211d\n\u22a2 Sort u_2\n\nx\u271d\u00b9 : Sort u_1\nsin : x\u271d\u00b9\nx\u271d : Sort u_2\ncos : x\u271d\nx : \u211d\n\u22a2 ?m.4031\nfail to show termination for\n  sin_sq_add_cos_sq\nwith errors\nstructural recursion cannot be used\n\nCould not find a decreasing measure.\nThe arguments relate at each recursive call as follows:\n(<, \u2264, =: relation proved, ? all proofs failed, _: no proof attempted)\n         \n1) 6:8-25\nPlease use `termination_by` to specify a decreasing measure.\nPlease revise the proof.",

Here's why:\n\nFirst, recall that the gradient of f at point a, which we'll call \u2207f(a), has a special relationship with directional derivatives. For any vector v, the directional derivative of f in direction v at point a equals the dot product of \u2207f(a) with v.\n\nIn this problem, we're given that the directional derivatives along each basis vector vi equals the corresponding component of vector w. This means that for each basis vector vi:\n- The directional derivative in direction vi equals the i-th component of w\n- This same directional derivative must also equal the dot product of \u2207f(a) with vi\n\nThis gives us a system of equations. For each basis vector, the dot product of \u2207f(a) with vi must equal the i-th component of w. Since we're working with a basis, these equations completely determine \u2207f(a).\n\nThe only vector that could satisfy all these equations is w itself, because:\n1. The dot product of w with each basis vector vi gives exactly the i-th component of w (by definition of dot product)\n2. These components match the given directional derivatives\n3.

We typically write this as a\u207b\u00b9 for the inverse of a.\n\nIn this case, we're given that a * b = 1. This is exactly the defining property of what it means to be a multiplicative inverse! When we multiply a and b together, we get 1, which is precisely what we need for b to be the multiplicative inverse of a.\n\nTo be thorough, we should note that this works because:\n1. We're told a and b are non-zero rational numbers, so they belong to the multiplicative group of non-zero rationals\n2. The multiplication of rational numbers is commutative, so a * b = b * a = 1\n3. Multiplicative inverses are unique in the rational numbers\n\nTherefore, since b multiplied by a equals 1, and this is the defining characteristic of a multiplicative inverse, b must be the multiplicative inverse of a.\n\nThis proof is particularly elegant because it follows directly from the definition of multiplicative inverse - we don't need any complex manipulations or additional steps.

This is one of their fundamental properties - when we move a shape through these transformations, its size and shape remain exactly the same.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\nWhen we say triangles ABC and DEF are congruent, this means they have exactly the same shape and size - all corresponding sides are equal in length and all corresponding angles are equal in measure. \n\nNow, when triangle ABC is transformed into triangle DEF through any combination of rotations, reflections, and translations, every point in triangle ABC maps to a corresponding point in triangle DEF. Specifically, point A maps to point D, point B maps to point E, and point C maps to point F.\n\nSince these transformations are rigid (they preserve distances), the distance between any two points in the original triangle must equal the distance between the corresponding points in the transformed triangle. Therefore, the length of side AB (the distance from point A to point B) must equal the length of its corresponding side DE (the distance from point D to point E).\n\nWe can verify this another way: if AB were not equal to DE, then the triangles would have different sizes and therefore couldn't be congruent. Since we're given that they are congruent and one can be transformed into the other through rigid transformations, AB must equal DE.\n\nThis proof relies on two fundamental principles:\n1.

We have a population where the true proportion is 0.7 (70%), and we're taking samples of size 100. We want to find the probability that a sample proportion will be less than 0.5 (50%).\n\nThe key insight is that for large sample sizes, the sampling distribution of proportions follows a normal distribution. The parameters of this normal distribution are:\n- Mean (\u03bc) = p = 0.7 (the population proportion)\n- Standard deviation (\u03c3) = sqrt(p(1-p)/n) = sqrt(0.7 \u00d7 0.3/100)\n\nTo find the probability, we need to:\n1. Calculate the standard deviation\n2. Find the z-score for x = 0.5\n3. Use this z-score to find the probability using the standard normal distribution\n\nThe z-score tells us how many standard deviations away from the mean our target value (0.5) is. We calculate this using the formula:\nz = (x - \u03bc)/\u03c3 = (0.5 - 0.7)/sqrt(0.7 \u00d7 0.3/100)\n\nSince 0.5 is less than the mean of 0.7, we'll get a negative z-score, indicating we're looking at the left tail of the distribution. The probability we're seeking is the area under the normal curve to the left of our z-score.\n\nThis approach works because:\n1. Our sample size (100) is large enough for the Central Limit Theorem to apply\n2. The sampling distribution of proportions is approximately normal\n3. We can standardize any normal distribution to the standard normal distribution using z-scores\n\nThe final probability will represent how likely it is to get a sample proportion less than 50% when sampling from a population where the true proportion is 70%.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'let'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\nexpected token\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'z_score', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'probability_less_than_x', and it does not have executable code\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\nunknown identifier 'erf'\nunknown identifier 'erf'\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'z_score', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'result', and it does not have executable code\nPlease revise the proof.",

Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. First, let's think about what F(x + \u0394x) - F(x) means in terms of integrals. When we subtract these, we're really looking at the difference between two integrals:\n   - One from a to (x + \u0394x)\n   - One from a to x\n\n2. This difference can be simplified to just the integral of f(t) from x to (x + \u0394x). This makes sense because the parts from a to x cancel out, leaving us with just the small piece we're interested in.\n\n3. Now, to find the derivative, we need to divide this difference by \u0394x and take the limit as \u0394x approaches zero. In other words, we're looking at:\n   The limit as \u0394x\u21920 of [1/\u0394x \u00d7 \u222bf(t)dt from x to (x + \u0394x)]\n\n4. Here's where we can use the Mean Value Theorem for Integrals. Since f is continuous, this theorem tells us that there must be some point k between x and (x + \u0394x) where f(k) times \u0394x equals our integral.\n\n5. This means our limit becomes:\n   The limit as \u0394x\u21920 of f(k)\n   where k is some point between x and (x + \u0394x)\n\n6. As \u0394x gets smaller and smaller, k must get closer and closer to x (since it's trapped between x and x + \u0394x).\n\n7. Since f is continuous, as k approaches x, f(k) must approach f(x).\n\nTherefore, the derivative of F(x) must equal f(x).\n\nThis works whether we approach from the right (\u0394x > 0) or from the left (\u0394x < 0), giving us the complete derivative at x.\n\nThe beauty of this proof is that it shows how the derivative and integral are truly inverse operations - the derivative \"undoes\" the integration process, bringing us back to our original function f(x).\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.measureSpace', and it does not have executable code\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown namespace 'Set'\nunexpected identifier; expected '|'\nunknown constant 'CoeFun'\nunknown constant 'sorryAx'\nunknown constant 'CoeFun'\nunknown constant 'sorryAx'\nunknown constant 'CoeFun'\nunknown constant 'sorryAx'\nunexpected identifier; expected '|'\nunknown constant 'CoeFun'\nunknown constant 'sorryAx'\nunknown constant 'CoeFun'\nunknown constant 'sorryAx'\nunknown constant 'CoeFun'\nunknown constant 'sorryAx'\nunexpected identifier; expected '|'\nunknown constant 'CoeFun'\nunknown constant 'sorryAx'\nunknown constant 'CoeFun'\nunknown constant 'sorryAx'\nunknown constant 'CoeFun'\nunknown constant 'sorryAx'\nunexpected identifier; expected '|'\nunknown constant 'CoeFun'\nunknown constant 'sorryAx'\nunknown constant 'CoeFun'\nunknown constant 'sorryAx'\nunknown constant 'CoeFun'\nunknown constant 'sorryAx'\nunexpected identifier; expected '|'\nunknown constant 'CoeFun'\nunknown constant 'sorryAx'\nunknown constant 'CoeFun'\nunknown constant 'sorryAx'\nunknown constant 'CoeFun'\nunknown constant 'sorryAx'\nunexpected identifier; expected '|'\nunknown constant 'CoeFun'\nunknown constant 'sorryAx'\nunknown constant 'CoeFun'\nunknown constant 'sorryAx'\nunknown constant 'CoeFun'\nunknown constant 'sorryAx'\nunexpected identifier; expected '|'\nunknown constant 'CoeFun'\nunknown constant 'sorryAx'\nunknown constant 'CoeFun'\nunknown constant 'sorryAx'\nunknown constant 'CoeFun'\nunknown constant 'sorryAx'\nunexpected identifier; expected '|'\nunknown constant 'CoeFun'\nunknown constant 'sorryAx'\nunknown constant 'CoeFun'\nunknown constant 'sorryAx'\nunknown constant 'CoeFun'\nunknown constant 'sorryAx'\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown namespace 'Set'\nexpected token\nPlease revise the proof.",

This is much simpler than the context problem of x^x since our exponent is just a linear term (2x) rather than a variable raised to itself.\n\nHere's how we can think about it:\n\n1) First, recall that the integral of e^(ax) is (1/a)e^(ax) + C.

Subtract the lower bound result from the upper bound result\n\nFor the function f(x) = 2x, we can find its antiderivative by using the power rule for integration. When we integrate 2x, we:\n- Increase the power by 1 (x becomes x\u00b2)\n- Divide by the new power (divide by 2)\nSo the antiderivative of 2x is x\u00b2.\n\nNow we can evaluate this antiderivative at x=1 (upper bound) and x=0 (lower bound):\n- At x=1: (1)\u00b2 = 1\n- At x=0: (0)\u00b2 = 0\n\nFinally, we subtract: 1 - 0 = 1\n\nThis shows that the definite integral of 2x from 0 to 1 equals 1.\n\nThe reasoning is similar to the example in the context where x\u00b2 was integrated, though our function is simpler.

Here's how we can solve this:\n\n1. When two lines intersect, we can find the angle between them using their slopes. The angle between EF and the parallel lines can be found using the slope formula: tan(\u03b8) = |(m\u2081 - m\u2082)/(1 + m\u2081m\u2082)|, where m\u2081 and m\u2082 are the slopes of the lines.\n\n2. In this case:\n   - m\u2081 = 2 (slope of parallel lines)\n   - m\u2082 = -0.5 (slope of EF)\n\n3. Once we have the angle, we can use basic trigonometry. The length of EF (let's call it L) will be related to the perpendicular distance (10 units) by:\n   L = 10/sin(\u03b8)\n\n4. The angle \u03b8 can be found by:\n   tan(\u03b8) = |(2 - (-0.5))/(1 + 2(-0.5))|\n   = |2.5/0| = 2.5\n\n5. Therefore, \u03b8 = arctan(2.5)\n\n6. The length of EF will be:\n   L = 10/sin(arctan(2.5))\n\nThis gives us the exact length of line EF. The key to this proof is understanding that when a line intersects parallel lines, we can use the relationship between slopes to find the angle, and then use trigonometry to find the length based on the known perpendicular distance between the parallel lines.\nPrevious attempt failed with: expected ')', '\u2191', '\u21a5', '\u21d1' or no space before\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'length_EF', and it does not have executable code\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: 'slope' has already been declared\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.sqrt', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\napplication type mismatch\n  length_EF A\nargument\n  A\nhas type\n  \u2115 \u00d7 \u2115 : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u211d \u00d7 \u211d : Type\ncompiler IR check failed at '_eval', error: unknown declaration 'length_EF'\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: 'slope' has already been declared\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.sqrt', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to synthesize\n  Field (\u211d \u00d7 \u211d)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  Field (\u211d \u00d7 \u211d)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  Field (\u211d \u00d7 \u211d)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\napplication type mismatch\n  slope E\nargument\n  E\nhas type\n  \u211d \u00d7 \u211d : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u211d \u00d7 \u211d \u2192 ?m.1633 : Type ?u.1629\napplication type mismatch\n  length_EF A\nargument\n  A\nhas type\n  \u2115 \u00d7 \u2115 : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u211d \u00d7 \u211d : Type\ncannot evaluate code because 'sorryAx' uses 'sorry' and/or contains errors\nPlease revise the proof.",

Let's break this down:\n\nFirst, the Wronskian W(x) = y\u2081y\u2082' - y\u2082y\u2081' measures how \"independent\" two solutions are at any point. When we differentiate this Wronskian (using the product rule), we get W' = y\u2081y\u2082'' - y\u2082y\u2081''.\n\nNow, since both y\u2081 and y\u2082 are solutions to our differential equation, we know that:\ny\u2081'' = -p(x)y\u2081' - q(x)y\u2081\ny\u2082'' = -p(x)y\u2082' - q(x)y\u2082\n\nWhen we substitute these expressions into our Wronskian derivative and do some algebra, something remarkable happens. All the terms with q(x) cancel out, and we're left with:\nW' = -p(x)W\n\nThis is the crucial step! This simple equation tells us how the Wronskian changes: its rate of change at any point is proportional to itself, with -p(x) as the proportionality factor.\n\nThis type of equation has a well-known solution:\nW(x) = Ce^{-\u222bp(x)dx}\n\nHere's why this proves our claim: the exponential function is never zero, so the only way W(x) can be zero is if C = 0. But if C = 0, then W(x) is zero everywhere. If C \u2260 0, then W(x) is never zero.\n\nTherefore, there are only two possibilities:\n1. Either C = 0 and the Wronskian is zero everywhere\n2. Or C \u2260 0 and the Wronskian is never zero\n\nThe Wronskian can't switch between being zero and non-zero because that would contradict the continuous nature of the exponential function.\n\nThis shows that the Wronskian must be either identically zero throughout the interval or never zero at all - there's no middle ground.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.RCLike', and it does not have executable code\nunexpected token 'fun'; expected '_' or identifier\nunsolved goals\ncase hW\np q y1 y2 : \u211d \u2192 \u211d\nh_diff : \u2200 (x : \u211d), HasDerivAt y1 (deriv y1 x) x \u2227 HasDerivAt y2 (deriv y2 x) x\nh_eq :\n  \u2200 (x : \u211d), deriv^[2] y1 x + p x * deriv y1 x + q x * y1 x = 0 \u2227 deriv^[2] y2 x + p x * deriv y2 x + q x * y2 x = 0\nW : \u211d \u2192 \u211d := wronskian y1 y2\nW' : \u211d \u2192 \u211d\nhW' : \u2200 (x : \u211d), W' x = -p x * W x\n\u22a2 \u211d \u2192 sorryAx (Sort ?u.2676) true\n\np q y1 y2 : \u211d \u2192 \u211d\nh_diff : \u2200 (x : \u211d), HasDerivAt y1 (deriv y1 x) x \u2227 HasDerivAt y2 (deriv y2 x) x\nh_eq :\n  \u2200 (x : \u211d), deriv^[2] y1 x + p x * deriv y1 x + q x * y1 x = 0 \u2227 deriv^[2] y2 x + p x * deriv y2 x + q x * y2 x = 0\nW : \u211d \u2192 \u211d := wronskian y1 y2\nW' : \u211d \u2192 \u211d\nhW' : \u2200 (x : \u211d), W' x = -p x * W x\nhW : \u211d \u2192 sorryAx (Sort ?u.2676) true\n\u22a2 (\u2200 (x : \u211d), wronskian y1 y2 x = 0) \u2228 \u2200 (x : \u211d), wronskian y1 y2 x \u2260 0\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: function expected at\n  wronskian\nterm has type\n  ?m.1606\ntype mismatch\n  hx\nhas type\n  W x\u271d = 0 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  W x = 0 : Prop\nno goals to be solved\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 't'\ninvalid field 'x', the environment does not contain 'Float.x'\n  0.\nhas type\n  Float\nunsolved goals\np q y1 y2 : \u211d \u2192 \u211d\nh_diff : \u2200 (x : \u211d), HasDerivAt y1 (deriv y1 x) x \u2227 HasDerivAt y2 (deriv y2 x) x\nh_eq :\n  \u2200 (x : \u211d), deriv^[2] y1 x + p x * deriv y1 x + q x * y1 x = 0 \u2227 deriv^[2] y2 x + p x * deriv y2 x + q x * y2 x = 0\nW : optParam (\u211d \u2192 \u211d) fun x => y1 x * deriv y2 x - y2 x * deriv y1 x\nW' : optParam (\u211d \u2192 \u211d) fun x => -p x * W x\nhW' hW_eq : \u2200 (x : \u211d), W' x = -p x * W x\n\u22a2 (\u2200 (x : \u211d), W x = 0) \u2228 \u2200 (x : \u211d), W x \u2260 0\nPlease revise the proof.",

We have a power series f(x) = \u2211a_n * x^n that converges absolutely within (-R, R), and we want to show that we can differentiate it term by term to get f'(x) = \u2211n*a_n * x^(n-1).\n\nThe key insight is that we can use the theorem about derivatives of uniformly convergent series from the context, but we need to establish some preliminary facts:\n\n1. Each term in our series (a_n * x^n) is continuously differentiable on any closed interval within (-R, R).\n\n2. When we differentiate each term, we get n*a_n * x^(n-1).\n\n3. The crucial step is showing that the series of derivatives converges uniformly on any closed interval [a,b] contained within (-R, R).\n\nHere's how we can prove this:\n\nFor any closed interval [a,b] strictly inside (-R, R), there exists a number r such that |x| \u2264 r < R for all x in [a,b]. Because the original series converges absolutely at R, we know that |a_n * R^n| is bounded by some M.\n\nThis means |a_n| \u2264 M/R^n. When we look at the terms in the derivative series (n*a_n * x^(n-1)), we can show they're bounded by:\n|n*a_n * x^(n-1)| \u2264 n*(M/R^n)*r^(n-1) = M*n*(r/R)^(n-1)/R\n\nSince r < R, the ratio r/R is less than 1, and this ensures uniform convergence of the derivative series on [a,b].\n\nBy applying the theorem from the context about derivatives of uniformly convergent series, we can conclude that f'(x) equals the sum of the derivatives of the individual terms, which is exactly \u2211n*a_n * x^(n-1).\n\nThis proves that we can indeed differentiate the power series term by term within its radius of convergence, and the resulting series gives us the derivative of the function.\n\nThe key to this proof is showing uniform convergence of the derivative series on any closed subinterval, which allows us to apply the theorem about derivatives of uniformly convergent series of continuously differentiable functions.\nPrevious attempt failed with: expected token\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  a n\nargument\n  n\nhas type\n  \u211d : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u2115 : Type\napplication type mismatch\n  hasDerivAt_tsum fun n => a n * x ^ n\nargument\n  fun n => a n * x ^ n\nhas type\n  \u2115 \u2192 \u211d : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  Summable ?m.137079 : Prop\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: 'hasDerivAt_tsum' has already been declared\nPlease revise the proof.",

Each specific value of t generates a specific point on the line. Since (p, q) is a point on the line, there must be some particular value of t that generates exactly this point.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n1. The parametric equations x = at + b and y = ct + d describe a line by giving the x and y coordinates of any point on the line in terms of a parameter t.\n\n2.

In this case:\n\nsin(A) = BC/AC = 0.5, where AC is the hypotenuse\n\nSince we know BC = 10, we can set up the equation:\n0.5 = 10/AC\n\nThis means AC (the hypotenuse) must be 20 units long.\n\nNow, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find AB:\nAB\u00b2 + BC\u00b2 = AC\u00b2\nAB\u00b2 + 10\u00b2 = 20\u00b2\nAB\u00b2 + 100 = 400\nAB\u00b2 = 300\nAB = \u221a300 \u2248 17.32\n\nSince we're told AB is an integer, and we need to test if AB \u2264 5, we can immediately reject this hypothesis. The actual value of AB is greater than 17, which is significantly larger than 5.

Here's the reasoning:\n\nFirst, we need to find how the function changes when we move a small distance h from the point a. At the point (a + h), the function value is (a + h)^2, and at point a, the function value is a^2.\n\nWhen we look at how much the function changes (the difference between these values) divided by how far we moved (h), we get the difference quotient. As we make h get closer and closer to zero, this quotient approaches the derivative value.\n\nLet's think about what happens when we expand (a + h)^2:\n- It becomes a^2 + 2ah + h^2\n- When we subtract a^2, we're left with 2ah + h^2\n- Dividing this by h gives us 2a + h\n\nThe beautiful thing is that as h approaches 0, the term h disappears, leaving us with exactly 2a.\n\nThis matches our intuition about the derivative representing the slope of the tangent line at point a. The slope at any point on a parabola is proportional to the x-coordinate of that point, which is why we get 2a as our answer.\n\nThe reasoning is essentially the same as the proof for the general case f'(x) = 2x, but we're just evaluating it at the specific point x = a.",

Here's the intuitive reasoning:\n\nFirst, let's understand what happens to our key components when we multiply all x-values by k:\n\n1. The covariance between x and y in the numerator of the slope formula is affected because it involves the x-values. When we multiply each x by k, we can factor out k from the terms involving x.\n\n2. The variance of x in the denominator is affected even more dramatically, because it involves squared x-values. When we multiply each x by k, the squared terms will contain k\u00b2.\n\nHere's how it works step by step:\n\n1. The original slope m is calculated as covariance(x,y) divided by variance(x). This is equivalent to the formula given in the context where we sum (x_i - x\u0304)(y_i - \u0233) and divide by sum(x_i - x\u0304)\u00b2.\n\n2. When we multiply each x value by k:\n   - Each x_i becomes k\u00d7x_i\n   - The mean x\u0304 becomes k\u00d7x\u0304\n   - Therefore each difference (x_i - x\u0304) becomes k(x_i - x\u0304)\n\n3. In the numerator (covariance):\n   - Each term (x_i - x\u0304)(y_i - \u0233) becomes k(x_i - x\u0304)(y_i - \u0233)\n   - The k can be factored out of the sum\n\n4. In the denominator (variance):\n   - Each term (x_i - x\u0304)\u00b2 becomes (k(x_i - x\u0304))\u00b2 = k\u00b2(x_i - x\u0304)\u00b2\n   - The k\u00b2 can be factored out of the sum\n\n5. When we divide the new numerator by the new denominator:\n   - We get (k \u00d7 original numerator)/(k\u00b2 \u00d7 original denominator)\n   - This simplifies to (1/k) \u00d7 (original slope)\n   - Therefore, m_new = k \u00d7 m\n\nThis relationship holds because the transformation of multiplying all x-values by k maintains the linear relationship between the variables while simply stretching or compressing the x-axis by a factor of k, which naturally results in the slope being adjusted by the same factor.\nPrevious attempt failed with: 'slope' has already been declared\nfailed to synthesize\n  Field (List \u211d)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  Field (List \u211d)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\napplication type mismatch\n  slope x\nargument\n  x\nhas type\n  List \u211d : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  List \u211d \u2192 ?m.1185 : Type ?u.1181\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: 'slope' has already been declared\nfailed to synthesize\n  Field (List \u211d)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  Field (List \u211d)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\napplication type mismatch\n  slope x\nargument\n  x\nhas type\n  List \u211d : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  List \u211d \u2192 ?m.1745 : Type ?u.1741\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: 'slope' has already been declared\nfailed to synthesize\n  Field (List \u211d)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  Field (List \u211d)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\napplication type mismatch\n  slope x\nargument\n  x\nhas type\n  List \u211d : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  List \u211d \u2192 ?m.1745 : Type ?u.1741\nunexpected token 'let'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

Here's how we can think about it:\n\nFirst, let's consider what it means for F to be an antiderivative of f. It means that at any point x in the interval [a, b], the derivative of F(x) equals f(x). In other words, F'(x) = f(x) for all x in [a, b].\n\nNow, imagine we're building up the integral from a to b piece by piece. At any point c in the interval [a, b], we can split the integral into two parts: from a to c, and from c to b. The fundamental property of definite integrals tells us that this splitting is valid.\n\nWhen we start at x = a, we know F(a) = 0. As we move through the interval, the rate of change of F at any point exactly matches the value of f at that point (since F is an antiderivative). This means that the accumulation of area under f(x) corresponds exactly to the change in the value of F(x).\n\nTherefore, when we reach the point b, the total accumulated area (which is what the definite integral represents) must equal the total change in F, which is F(b) - F(a).\n\nThis relationship is not coincidental - it's a fundamental connection between integration and differentiation, showing how they are inverse operations. The fact that F(a) = 0 gives us our starting point, and the accumulation process leads us naturally to F(b) as our endpoint.\n\nThe result F(b) - F(a) represents the net change in the antiderivative over the interval [a, b], which exactly equals the area accumulated by the definite integral of f(x) over the same interval.",

Here's why:\n\nTo show a limit exists and equals some value L, we need to demonstrate that we can make f(x) as close as we want to L by taking x sufficiently close to c. In this case, L would be f(c).\n\nSince we know f is continuous at c, we already have this property: For any epsilon we choose, we can find a delta that ensures f(x) stays within epsilon of f(c) when x is close enough to c (within delta of c).\n\nThis matches exactly with the definition of a limit - for any degree of closeness we want in the output (epsilon), we can achieve it by getting sufficiently close in the input (delta).\n\nTherefore, the very property that makes f continuous at c (the ability to keep f(x) close to f(c) by keeping x close to c) is precisely what's needed to conclude that the limit of f(x) as x approaches c must equal f(c).\n\nThe continuity of f at c essentially guarantees that there are no \"jumps\" or \"gaps\" in the function near c, so the limiting value must match the function's actual value at that point.\nPrevious attempt failed with: function expected at\n  Iic\nterm has type\n  ?m.135\nfunction expected at\n  Ici\nterm has type\n  ?m.173\nunknown identifier 'Iic_subset_Iic_self'\nunknown identifier 'Ici_subset_Ici_self'\ninvalid field notation, type is not of the form (C ...) where C is a constant\n  ContinuousWithinAt\nhas type\n  (?m.3859 \u2192 ?m.3860) \u2192 Set ?m.3859 \u2192 ?m.3859 \u2192 Prop\nfunction expected at\n  Iic\nterm has type\n  ?m.6551\nfunction expected at\n  Ici\nterm has type\n  ?m.6589\nunknown identifier 'Iic_subset_Iic_self'\nunknown identifier 'Ici_subset_Ici_self'\ninvalid field notation, type is not of the form (C ...) where C is a constant\n  ContinuousWithinAt\nhas type\n  (?m.10275 \u2192 ?m.10276) \u2192 Set ?m.10275 \u2192 ?m.10275 \u2192 Prop\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  ContinuousWithinAt.mono h\nargument\n  h\nhas type\n  ContinuousAt f c : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  ContinuousWithinAt f ?m.334 c : Prop\napplication type mismatch\n  ContinuousWithinAt.mono h\nargument\n  h\nhas type\n  ContinuousAt f c : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  ContinuousWithinAt f ?m.1636 c : Prop\nunknown identifier 'tendsto_nhds_of_tendsto_nhdsWithin_of_tendsto_nhdsWithin'\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  TopologicalSpace \u03b1\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  TopologicalSpace \u03b1\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  TopologicalSpace \u03b1\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  TopologicalSpace \u03b1\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  TopologicalSpace \u03b1\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  TopologicalSpace \u03b1\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  TopologicalSpace \u03b1\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  TopologicalSpace \u03b1\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nPlease revise the proof.",

When the function is above the x-axis (y > 0), we'll add the area, and when it's below (y < 0), we'll subtract the area. However, for the final bounded area, we'll need to take the absolute value of these portions.\n\n3. To find the x-intercepts, we need to solve 3x^3 - 4x + 2 = 0. This is a cubic equation and by inspection or numerical methods, we can find that there is one real root in our interval, let's call it r.\n\n4.

When we multiply by 10, we're essentially multiplying by (10 = 10^1), which in our decimal number system means we're scaling the number up by one decimal place. This happens because our decimal system is based on powers of 10.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n1. When we multiply a number by 10, each digit in the original number becomes 10 times larger. In our place-value system, this means each digit shifts one position to the left, and a zero fills the rightmost position. From the decimal point's perspective, this appears as the decimal point moving one place to the right.\n\n2. When we multiply by 10^2 (=100), we're effectively multiplying by 10 twice. This shifts all digits two positions to the left, or equivalently, moves the decimal point two places to the right.\n\n3. By extension, when we multiply by 10^n, we're multiplying by 10 exactly n times. Each multiplication by 10 shifts the decimal point one position to the right, so n multiplications shift it n positions.\n\nFor example:\n- 3.14 \u00d7 10^1 = 31.4\n- 3.14 \u00d7 10^2 = 314\n- 3.14 \u00d7 10^3 = 3,140\n\nThis works because in our decimal system, each position represents a power of 10. Moving right from the decimal point, we have the ones place (10^0), tens place (10^1), hundreds place (10^2), and so on. Moving left from the decimal point, we have tenths (10^-1), hundredths (10^-2), and so on.\n\nTherefore, multiplying by 10^n systematically shifts each digit n places to the left, which is equivalent to moving the decimal point n places to the right.",

The sequence a_n = n^2 - 2n + 3 is given in a quadratic form, but we're asked to interpret it as a linear regression model y = \u03b20 + \u03b21*n. To find the slope (\u03b21), we need to understand how the sequence behaves as n increases.\n\nThe key insight is that n^2 grows much faster than the other terms. Let's break this down:\n- The n^2 term grows quadratically (gets much larger as n increases)\n- The -2n term grows linearly (grows more slowly)\n- The +3 term is constant (doesn't change)\n\nWhen n becomes large:\n1. n^2 becomes the dominant term\n2. The -2n term becomes relatively insignificant compared to n^2\n3. The constant term 3 becomes even less significant\n\nTherefore, as n increases, the sequence will grow increasingly faster, following primarily the behavior of n^2. This means the sequence cannot be properly modeled by a linear equation y = \u03b20 + \u03b21*n, because no constant slope \u03b21 could accurately capture the quadratic growth.\n\nThis implies that:\n1. The sequence is strictly increasing for sufficiently large n\n2. The rate of increase itself is increasing (due to the quadratic term)\n3. Any attempt to fit a linear model would result in an underestimation of the sequence's growth\n\nTherefore, while we cannot assign a fixed slope \u03b21 that would accurately model this sequence, we can conclude that the sequence diverges to positive infinity at a rate faster than any linear function.

        "informal_proof": "# Informal Proof:\n\nLet me explain why a function that is differentiable at a point must have partial derivatives at that point. This proof builds on our understanding of differentiability in multiple variables and how it relates to partial derivatives.\n\nThe key insight is that differentiability is a stronger condition than having partial derivatives. When a function f is differentiable at a point (x\u2080, y\u2080), it means that f can be well-approximated by a linear function near that point, with the approximation error becoming negligible compared to the distance from (x\u2080, y\u2080).\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. Since f is differentiable at (x\u2080, y\u2080), there exists a linear transformation (represented by partial derivatives) that best approximates the change in f near (x\u2080, y\u2080). This means we can write:\n\n   f(x\u2080 + h, y\u2080 + k) = f(x\u2080, y\u2080) + A\u00b7h + B\u00b7k + E(h,k)\n\n   where A and B are constants (which turn out to be the partial derivatives), and E(h,k) is an error term that becomes negligible compared to \u221a(h\u00b2 + k\u00b2) as (h,k) approaches (0,0).\n\n2. To find the partial derivative with respect to x at (x\u2080, y\u2080), we only need to consider movement in the x-direction. This means setting k = 0 in our approximation:\n\n   f(x\u2080 + h, y\u2080) = f(x\u2080, y\u2080) + A\u00b7h + E(h,0)\n\n3.

When we have a loss, we treat it as a negative number. So John's initial position is negative 2 1/2 dollars (-2.5 dollars).\n\nThen, we need to add his gain of 1 2/3 dollars (or 1.667... dollars) to determine his net position.\n\nTo add these numbers, it's helpful to convert them to a common fraction format:\n- -2 1/2 can be written as -5/2 dollars\n- 1 2/3 can be written as 5/3 dollars\n\nWhen we add these together, we're really performing the operation:\n(-5/2) + (5/3)\n\nTo add fractions with different denominators, we need to find a common denominator. The denominators are 2 and 3, so the least common multiple is 6. Converting both fractions:\n- -5/2 becomes -15/6 (multiply both top and bottom by 3)\n- 5/3 becomes 10/6 (multiply both top and bottom by 2)\n\nNow we can add: -15/6 + 10/6 = -5/6\n\nTherefore, John still has a net loss of 5/6 dollars (approximately $0.83). This makes sense because his gain of 1 2/3 dollars was not enough to fully offset his initial loss of 2 1/2 dollars.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: The rfl tactic failed.

At any time t, r(t) is a unit vector pointing from the origin to a point on the unit circle.\n\nTo show orthogonality, we need to prove that r(t) and its derivative r'(t) are perpendicular to each other. We can do this by showing their dot product is zero.\n\nThe derivative r'(t) = (-sin(t), cos(t)) represents the velocity vector at any point.

Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. First, let's understand what [x]B means. When we write a vector x in terms of basis B, we're saying:\n   x = a\u2081v\u2081 + a\u2082v\u2082 + ... + a\u2099v\u2099\n   where [x]B = [a\u2081, a\u2082, ..., a\u2099]\u1d40\n\n2. Similarly, for basis C:\n   x = b\u2081w\u2081 + b\u2082w\u2082 + ... + b\u2099w\u2099\n   where [x]C = [b\u2081, b\u2082, ..., b\u2099]\u1d40\n\n3. The change of basis matrix P from B to C is constructed by expressing each vector in basis B in terms of basis C. Specifically, each column of P contains the coordinates of the corresponding basis vector from B written in terms of basis C.\n\n4. When we multiply P by [x]B, we're effectively doing two things:\n   - Taking the linear combination that expresses x in basis B\n   - Converting that same vector to its representation in basis C\n\n5. This works because P contains all the information needed to transform coordinates from one basis to another, and matrix multiplication precisely captures how the linear combinations should be combined.\n\n6. Since both [x]C and P[x]B represent the same vector x in basis C, they must be equal. This is because basis representations are unique - there's only one way to write a vector as a linear combination of basis vectors.\n\nThe beauty of this proof lies in how it connects the geometric idea of changing bases with the algebraic operation of matrix multiplication. The change of basis matrix P acts as a \"dictionary\" that translates coordinates from one basis to another, and the equation [x]C = P[x]B captures this translation process perfectly.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown constant 'FiniteDimensional.Basis'\nunknown constant 'FiniteDimensional.Basis'\nexpected token\nunknown constant 'FiniteDimensional.Basis.ofVectorSpace'\nunknown constant 'FiniteDimensional.Basis.ofVectorSpace'\ntype mismatch\n  ?m.8223.toMatrix \u21d1B\nhas type\n  Matrix ?m.6894 ?m.9826 ?m.6896 : Type (max ?u.6890 ?u.6891 ?u.6892)\nbut is expected to have type\n  Sort ?u.3946 : Type ?u.3946\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown constant 'FiniteDimensional.Basis'\nunknown constant 'FiniteDimensional.Basis'\nexpected token\nunknown constant 'FiniteDimensional.Basis.ofVectorSpace'\nunknown constant 'FiniteDimensional.Basis.ofVectorSpace'\ntype mismatch\n  B.toMatrix C\nhas type\n  Matrix ?m.4877 ?m.5083 ?m.4878 : Type (max ?u.3959 ?u.3960 ?u.3961)\nbut is expected to have type\n  Sort ?u.3946 : Type ?u.3946\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown constant 'FiniteDimensional.Basis'\nunknown constant 'FiniteDimensional.Basis'\nexpected token\nunknown constant 'FiniteDimensional.Basis.ofVectorSpace'\nunknown constant 'FiniteDimensional.Basis.ofVectorSpace'\ninvalid field notation, type is not of the form (C ...) where C is a constant\n  B\nhas type\n  ?m.3948\ninvalid field notation, type is not of the form (C ...) where C is a constant\n  B\nhas type\n  ?m.3948\nPlease revise the proof.",

The original cube has a side length of 5 cm, so its volume is 5\u00b3 = 125 cubic centimeters\n2. The removed cube has a side length of 2 cm, so its volume is 2\u00b3 = 8 cubic centimeters\n\nNow, let's look at the masses:\n1. Original cube: 20 grams\n2.

Initially, we have a rectangle R with length l and width w, so its area is l \u00d7 w\n\n2. When we transform it to R':\n   - The new length becomes (l + a)\n   - The new width becomes (w - a)\n   - The area of R' is therefore (l + a)(w - a)\n\n3.

We have two different bases for the same vector space, and we want to show there's exactly one matrix that converts coordinates from one basis to the other.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. Let's start by considering how the basis vectors of B2 can be expressed in terms of B1. Since B1 is a basis, each wj from B2 can be written uniquely as a linear combination of vectors in B1. Let's call the coefficients of these combinations aij. These coefficients will form our matrix A.\n\n2. For any vector v in V, we can write it in terms of B2 coordinates: if [v]B2 = (x1, ..., xn), then v = x1w1 + ... + xnwn. But each wj is itself a linear combination of vectors in B1 using the coefficients aij we found.\n\n3. When we substitute these expressions and rearrange terms, we get the coordinates of v in terms of B1. The way these terms combine is exactly matrix multiplication of A with [v]B2, giving us [v]B1.\n\n4. For uniqueness, suppose there was another matrix A' that did the same job. Then A[v]B2 = A'[v]B2 for all vectors v. In particular, this must be true when v is each of the basis vectors in B2. This gives us enough equations to show A must equal A'.\n\nThe key insight is that the matrix A is actually built from the coordinates of the B2 basis vectors when expressed in B1.

Here's how we can think about it:\n\nFirst, we start with a rectangle ABCD where AB = a and BC = b. The diagonal AC divides this rectangle into two equal triangles (ABC and ADC). This is a fundamental property of rectangles - their diagonals bisect the area.\n\nNow, we're told that AC is transformed into AE where AE = AB + BC. This is a crucial piece of information. Since AE equals the sum of the rectangle's width and height, point E must lie somewhere outside the original rectangle.\n\nThe interesting part is that if we draw BE, we create a new triangle ABE. The question asks us to prove this triangle has half the area of the original rectangle.\n\nThe key to solving this is to notice that when we extend AC to E such that AE = AB + BC, we're essentially \"unfolding\" the rectangle in a way that preserves area relationships. The new point E is positioned such that triangle ABE encompasses exactly half of the original rectangle's area.\n\nWe can think about it this way: the original diagonal AC divided the rectangle into two equal parts. When we extend it to E, we're essentially \"stretching\" one of these triangular halves while maintaining the same base (AB) and keeping the new vertex E at just the right distance (AE = AB + BC) to preserve the area relationship.\n\nThis relationship works because the area of a triangle depends on its base and height, and the transformation to point E is done in such a way that the resulting triangle ABE maintains exactly half the area of the original rectangle, despite having a different shape.\n\nThe beauty of this proof lies in how it connects to the fundamental properties of rectangles and triangles, particularly the relationship between parallel lines, bases, and areas - similar to what we saw in the context about parallelograms and triangles sharing the same base.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to infer binder type\nwhen the resulting type of a declaration is explicitly provided, all holes (e.g., `_`) in the header are resolved before the declaration body is processed\ndon't know how to synthesize implicit argument\n  @Exists (?m.565 a b) fun E => \u2200 (A B C D : \u211d), A = 0 \u2227 B = a \u2227 C = a + b \u2227 D = 0 \u2192 1 / 2 * a * b = 1 / 2 * (a + b) * a\ncontext:\na b : \u211d\n\u22a2 Sort ?u.6\nwhen the resulting type of a declaration is explicitly provided, all holes (e.g., `_`) in the header are resolved before the declaration body is processed\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to infer binder type\nwhen the resulting type of a declaration is explicitly provided, all holes (e.g., `_`) in the header are resolved before the declaration body is processed\ndon't know how to synthesize implicit argument\n  @Exists (?m.565 a b) fun E => \u2200 (A B C D : \u211d), A = 0 \u2227 B = a \u2227 C = a + b \u2227 D = 0 \u2192 1 / 2 * a * b = 1 / 2 * (a + b) * a\ncontext:\na b : \u211d\n\u22a2 Sort ?u.6\nwhen the resulting type of a declaration is explicitly provided, all holes (e.g., `_`) in the header are resolved before the declaration body is processed\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to infer binder type\nwhen the resulting type of a declaration is explicitly provided, all holes (e.g., `_`) in the header are resolved before the declaration body is processed\ndon't know how to synthesize implicit argument\n  @Exists (?m.565 a b) fun E => \u2200 (A B C D : \u211d), A = 0 \u2227 B = a \u2227 C = a + b \u2227 D = 0 \u2192 1 / 2 * a * b = 1 / 2 * (a + b) * a\ncontext:\na b : \u211d\n\u22a2 Sort ?u.6\nwhen the resulting type of a declaration is explicitly provided, all holes (e.g., `_`) in the header are resolved before the declaration body is processed\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "# Informal Proof:\n\nLet me explain why we can find a matrix B that \"undoes\" what matrix A does to vector v, using intuitive reasoning about transformations and the given context.\n\nFirst, let's understand what we know:\n1. We have a 2\u00d72 matrix A that transforms a vector v into vector w\n2. The transformation is expressed in polar coordinates\n3. The determinant of A is non-zero\n4. We need to prove there exists a matrix B that transforms w back to v\n\nHere's the intuitive reasoning:\n\nWhen matrix A transforms vector v to w, it's essentially performing two types of operations in polar coordinates: it might rotate the vector and/or scale its length. Since we know the determinant of A is non-zero, this means A doesn't collapse the space - it doesn't squash any vectors to zero length or flatten them onto a line. In other words, A preserves the dimensionality of the space.\n\nFrom the context provided, we can see that for any invertible matrix A, its inverse can be expressed as:\nA\u207b\u00b9 = (1/det(A)) \u00d7 adj(A)\n\nThis means we can construct our matrix B as follows:\n1. First, calculate the adjugate matrix of A (which involves cofactors)\n2. Then multiply this adjugate matrix by 1/det(A)\n\nThis works because:\n- The non-zero determinant guarantees that 1/det(A) exists\n- The adjugate matrix contains the structural information needed to \"undo\" the transformation\n- When we multiply A by this constructed B, we get the identity matrix\n\nTherefore, this matrix B will transform w back to v because:\n- If Av = w\n- Then Bw = B(Av) = (BA)v = Iv = v\n\nThe transformation is fully reversible because we haven't lost any information in the process, thanks to the non-zero determinant. This is true regardless of whether we're working in Cartesian or polar coordinates, as the underlying linear transformation properties remain the same.\nPrevious attempt failed with: function expected at\n  det\nterm has type\n  x\u271d\nexpected token\ntype mismatch\n  B\nhas type\n  Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) \u211d : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  Prop : Type\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: function expected at\n  det\nterm has type\n  x\u271d\napplication type mismatch\n  B.mulVec w\nargument\n  w\nhas type\n  Vector \u211d 2 : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  Fin 2 \u2192 \u211d : Type\ntype mismatch\n  v\nhas type\n  Vector \u211d 2 : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  Fin 2 \u2192 \u211d : Type\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'let'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\napplication type mismatch\n  (inverse A).mulVec w\nargument\n  w\nhas type\n  Vector \u211d 2 : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  Fin 2 \u2192 \u211d : Type\napplication type mismatch\n  B.mulVec (transform_polar A v)\nargument\n  transform_polar A v\nhas type\n  Vector \u211d 2 : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  Fin 2 \u2192 \u211d : Type\ntype mismatch\n  v\nhas type\n  Vector \u211d 2 : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  Fin 2 \u2192 \u211d : Type\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

We need to find a single number (let's call it x) that, when multiplied by each number in the first set, gives us the corresponding number in the second set.\n\nLet's analyze this systematically:\n1. For the first pair (2 \u2192 1), if we divide 1 by 2, we get 1/2\n2. For the second pair (4 \u2192 3), if we divide 3 by 4, we get 3/4\n3.

This is because:\n- 2 \u00d7 (any factor) = 1 would require a factor of 1/2\n- 4 \u00d7 (any factor) = 3 would require a factor of 3/4\n- 6 \u00d7 (any factor) = 5 would require a factor of 5/6\n- 8 \u00d7 (any factor) = 7 would require a factor of 7/8\n\nSince these factors are all different, we must conclude that there is no single factor that can transform the first set into the second set.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that no such factor exists.\nPrevious attempt failed with: type mismatch\n  hx 0\nhas type\n  (2 * \u2191\u21910 + 2) * x = 2 * \u2191\u21910 + 1 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  (2 * 0 + 2) * x = 2 * 0 + 1 : Prop\ntype mismatch\n  hx 1\nhas type\n  (2 * \u2191\u21911 + 2) * x = 2 * \u2191\u21911 + 1 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  (2 * 1 + 2) * x = 2 * 1 + 1 : Prop\nPlease revise the proof.",

The standard error of the mean (SEM) for samples of size 30 would be the population standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size: 10/\u221a30.\n\nTo determine if we can reject the null hypothesis, we need to calculate how many standard errors away from the hypothesized mean (80) our sample mean (85) lies. This is our z-score.\n\nIf this z-score is greater than the critical value for a one-tailed test at \u03b1 = 0.05 (which is 1.645), then we can reject the null hypothesis.\n\nThe z-score is calculated as: (sample mean - hypothesized mean)/SEM\n= (85 - 80)/(10/\u221a30)\n= 5/(10/\u221a30)\n= 5/(1.83)\n\u2248 2.74\n\nSince 2.74 > 1.645, we can reject the null hypothesis at the 0.05 significance level. This means we have sufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the new teaching method has a positive effect on test scores.\n\nThe key insight is that if the null hypothesis were true, it would be very unlikely (probability less than 0.05) to observe a sample mean this far above the hypothesized population mean by random chance alone.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\nunknown constant 'Real.sqrt_eq_rsqrt'\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, equality or iff proof expected\n  ?m.3185\nhz : zScore = (85 - 80) / (10 / \u221a30)\nhz' : zScore = 5 / (10 / \u221a30)\n\u22a2 zScore = 5 / (10 / 5.477225575051661)\nunsolved goals\nhz : zScore = (85 - 80) / (10 / \u221a30)\nhz' : zScore = 5 / (10 / \u221a30)\nhz'' : zScore = 5 / (10 / 5.477225575051661)\n\u22a2 zScore = 10000000000000000 / 3651483720051667\nfailed to synthesize\n  HasEquiv \u211d\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nunsolved goals\nhz : zScore = (85 - 80) / (10 / \u221a30)\nhz' : zScore = 5 / (10 / \u221a30)\nhz'' : zScore = 5 / (10 / 5.477225575051661)\nhz''' : zScore = 5 / 1.8257418600258335\n\u22a2 sorryAx (Sort ?u.3765) true\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase h\nhz : zScore = (85 - 80) / (10 / \u221a30)\nhz' : zScore = 5 / (10 / \u221a30)\nhz'' : zScore = 5 / (10 / 5.477225575051661)\nhz''' : zScore = 5 / 1.8257418600258335\nhz'''' : sorryAx (Sort ?u.3765) true\nhc : criticalValue = 1.645\na\u271d : criticalValue \u2265 zScore\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\napplication type mismatch\n  @ite ?m.4919 canRejectNullHypothesis\nargument\n  canRejectNullHypothesis\nhas type\n  zScore > criticalValue : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  Prop : Type\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'populationMean'\nunknown identifier 'populationMean'\nunknown identifier 'populationMean'\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\ntype of theorem 'canRejectNullHypothesis' is not a proposition\n  Bool\ninvalid argument, variable is not a proposition or let-declaration\nsimp made no progress\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown namespace 'Real'\nunexpected token '-'; expected ')', ',' or ':'\nunknown constant 'OfScientific'\nunknown constant 'sorryAx'\nunknown constant 'sorryAx'\ntype mismatch\n  zScore\nhas type\n  \u211d : Sort ?u.44\nbut is expected to have type\n  Bool : Sort ?u.48\nunknown constant 'sorryAx'\nexpected token\nunknown constant 'OfNat'\nunknown constant 'sorryAx'\nunknown constant 'OfNat'\nunknown constant 'sorryAx'\nunknown constant 'OfNat'\nunknown constant 'sorryAx'\nunknown constant 'OfNat'\nunknown constant 'sorryAx'\nunknown identifier 'zScore'\nunknown constant 'sorryAx'\nunknown identifier 'canRejectNullHypothesis'\nunknown constant 'sorryAx'\nunknown constant 'sorryAx'\nunknown constant 'sorryAx'\nunknown constant 'sorryAx'\nunknown constant 'sorryAx'\nunknown constant 'sorryAx'\nunknown constant 'sorryAx'\nunknown identifier 'main'\nunknown constant 'sorryAx'\nPlease revise the proof.",

The volume of a rectangular prism is found by multiplying its length, width, and height together.\n\nSo, the volume would be:\n5 cm \u00d7 3 cm \u00d7 4 cm = 60 cubic centimeters (cm\u00b3)\n\nNow that we have both the mass (60 grams) and the volume (60 cm\u00b3), we can find the density by dividing the mass by the volume:\n\nDensity = 60 grams \u00f7 60 cm\u00b3 = 1 gram per cubic centimeter (g/cm\u00b3)\n\nTherefore, the density of the rectangular prism is 1 gram per cubic centimeter, meaning that each cubic centimeter of the prism contains 1 gram of mass.\n\nThis is a uniform density throughout the prism, assuming the material is homogeneous (the same throughout).\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\n'height' has already been declared\nfailed to synthesize\n  HMul \u211d ((\u03b1 : Type ?u.192) \u2192 [inst : Preorder \u03b1] \u2192 \u03b1 \u2192 WithBot (WithTop \u2115)) ?m.14352\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'density', and it does not have executable code\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'density', and it does not have executable code\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'calc'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'density', and it does not have executable code\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'calc'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

The position of the particle can be found using parametric equations, where the x and y coordinates depend on time t.\n\nGiven that:\n- The radius (r) is 5 units\n- The speed (s) is 10 units per second\n- We want to find the position at t = 2 seconds\n\nWe need to:\n1. Calculate the angular velocity (\u03c9) using the formula \u03c9 = s/r\n2. Plug this value of \u03c9 and t = 2 into the parametric equations to find x and y coordinates\n\nThe reasoning flows like this:\n- The angular velocity \u03c9 = 10/5 = 2 radians per second\n- At any time t, the x-coordinate is given by r\u00d7cos(\u03c9t)\n- At any time t, the y-coordinate is given by r\u00d7sin(\u03c9t)\n- When t = 2 seconds:\n  * x = 5\u00d7cos(2\u00d72) = 5\u00d7cos(4)\n  * y = 5\u00d7sin(2\u00d72) = 5\u00d7sin(4)\n\nThis gives us the exact position of the particle at t = 2 seconds. The values of cos(4) and sin(4) can be calculated using a calculator to get the final numerical coordinates.\n\nThe beauty of this solution lies in how the parametric equations naturally incorporate both the circular path (through sine and cosine) and the constant speed (through the angular velocity). The radius r acts as an amplitude for both coordinates, while \u03c9t gives us the angle of rotation at any time t.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'particle_position', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'position', and it does not have executable code\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'particle_position', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'example_position', and it does not have executable code\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'particle_position', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'particle_position', and it does not have executable code\nPlease revise the proof.",

We have a non-negative continuous function f(x) on an interval [a,b], and we know that the total area under this curve (which we call A) is equal to \u222b_a^b f(x) dx. We need to show that if we take any point c in [a,b], the area from a to c (\u222b_a^c f(x) dx) cannot exceed the total area A.\n\nThe key insight is that since f(x) is non-negative everywhere on [a,b], any portion of the area under the curve must also be non-negative. When we split the interval [a,b] at point c, we get two parts: the area from a to c, and the area from c to b. Both of these parts must be non-negative because f(x) \u2265 0.\n\nWe can write this mathematically as:\nA = \u222b_a^b f(x) dx = \u222b_a^c f(x) dx + \u222b_c^b f(x) dx\n\nSince f(x) \u2265 0, we know that \u222b_c^b f(x) dx \u2265 0. Therefore, when we add this non-negative quantity to \u222b_a^c f(x) dx, we get a larger (or equal) number.\n\nThis means that \u222b_a^c f(x) dx must be less than or equal to the total area A, because A is what we get when we add a non-negative quantity to \u222b_a^c f(x) dx.\n\nThis reasoning holds for any choice of c in [a,b], which completes our proof.\n\nThe key to this proof is understanding that non-negative functions produce non-negative areas under their curves, and that the total area must be at least as large as any partial area because we're always adding non-negative quantities.\nPrevious attempt failed with: function expected at\n  Icc\nterm has type\n  ?m.386\nfunction expected at\n  Icc\nterm has type\n  ?m.386\nfunction expected at\n  Icc\nterm has type\n  ?m.386\nunknown identifier 'integral_mono_on'\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown namespace 'Set'\nexpected token\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown namespace 'Set'\nexpected token\nPlease revise the proof.",

Using the chain rule, we can find its derivative by multiplying the derivative of the outer function (e^x) evaluated at 2x by the derivative of the inner function (2x). Since the derivative of e^x is e^x, and the derivative of 2x is 2, we get:\nf'(x) = e^(2x) \u00d7 2 = 2e^(2x)\n\nNow for the second part, we need to verify that this function satisfies the differential equation df/dx = 2f:\nWe just found that f'(x) = 2e^(2x)\nAnd we know that f(x) = e^(2x)\nTherefore, f'(x) = 2f(x), since 2e^(2x) = 2(e^(2x))\n\nThis shows that our function f(x) = e^(2x) is indeed a solution to the differential equation df/dx = 2f. The key insight is that the exponential function has the special property that its derivative is proportional to itself, which makes it particularly well-suited for this type of differential equation.\n\nThe solution makes sense intuitively because the rate of change of the function (f'(x)) is always twice the value of the function itself (2f(x)) at any point, which is exactly what the differential equation df/dx = 2f requires.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.exp', and it does not have executable code\ncompiler IR check failed at 'f'', error: unknown declaration 'Real.exp'\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.exp', and it does not have executable code\ncompiler IR check failed at 'f'', error: unknown declaration 'Real.exp'\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.exp', and it does not have executable code\nunknown identifier 'deriv'\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

Each of these disks is essentially a very thin cylinder. If we can find the area of each disk and add them all up (using integration), we'll get the total volume of the cone.\n\nHere's how we think about it:\n1. At any height x from the apex (top) of the cone, we have a circular disk\n2. The radius of each disk varies with height, getting larger as we move from top to bottom\n3. Due to similar triangles, we can find the radius at any height using the ratio r/h (where r is the final radius and h is the total height)\n\nAt any height x, the radius of the disk (let's call it R(x)) is proportional to x:\n- When x = 0 (at the top), the radius is 0\n- When x = h (at the bottom), the radius is r\n- For any height x in between, R(x) = (r/h)x\n\nThe area of each disk is \u03c0 * R(x)^2\nSo at any height x, the area is \u03c0 * (r/h)^2 * x^2\n\nTo get the total volume, we need to integrate this area from x = 0 to x = h:\n- We integrate \u03c0 * (r/h)^2 * x^2 dx from 0 to h\n- This gives us \u03c0 * (r/h)^2 * (h^3/3)\n- Simplifying, we get (1/3) * \u03c0 * r^2 * h\n\nThis shows that the volume of the cone is indeed one-third the volume of a cylinder with the same base and height, which makes intuitive sense as the cone tapers to a point while the cylinder maintains its full width throughout.\nPrevious attempt failed with: ambiguous, possible interpretations \n  \u03c0 : \u2115 \u2192 \u2115\n  \n  \u03c0 : \u211d\nfunction expected at\n  volume\nterm has type\n  ?m.8\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown namespace 'Real'\nexpected token\nunknown constant 'CoeFun'\nunknown constant 'sorryAx'\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: expected token\nexpected token\nunknown constant 'CoeFun'\nunknown constant 'sorryAx'\nPlease revise the proof.",

By the definition of complex modulus, we know that |z| = \u221a(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2). Therefore, |z|^2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2.\n\nNow, to show this forms a parabola, we need to think about how this relates to the coordinate plane. When we're graphing y = |z|^2:\n- The horizontal axis represents the real part (a)\n- The vertical axis represents the imaginary part (b)\n- For any point (a,b) in the plane, the height of the surface above that point is a\u00b2 + b\u00b2\n\nThis means that for any point in the complex plane, we're plotting a point in 3D space where:\n- x-coordinate is a\n- y-coordinate is b\n- z-coordinate is a\u00b2 + b\u00b2\n\nThe equation z = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 is the key. This is equivalent to z = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 in standard coordinate notation, which is the standard form of a paraboloid in 3D space. If we were to take any vertical slice through this surface (keeping y constant), we would get a parabola of the form z = x\u00b2 + C, where C is some constant.\n\nSimilarly, if we take any horizontal slice (keeping x constant), we get another parabola z = y\u00b2 + C. The symmetry of the equation a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 tells us that this surface is rotationally symmetric around the z-axis.\n\nTherefore, |z|^2 creates a paraboloid surface that opens upward, with its vertex at the origin (0,0,0), and every vertical cross-section through the origin is a parabola. This proves that the graph of y = |z|^2 is indeed a paraboloid made up of parabolas.\n\nThe fact that this surface is always non-negative (since we're adding squares) and opens upward (due to the squared terms) further confirms its parabolic nature.",

Here's the reasoning:\n\nFirst, we can rewrite any point (x, y) on the original line in parametric form. Since ax + by + c = 0, we can express one variable in terms of the other. For example, we can write y = (-a/b)x - c/b (assuming b \u2260 0). This means we can represent any point on the line as:\n(t, (-a/b)t - c/b) where t is a parameter that varies over \u211d.\n\nWhen we apply the linear transformation T to any point on this line, we're multiplying the 2\u00d72 matrix A by each point vector. Due to the properties of linear transformations (specifically linearity and the fact that matrix multiplication preserves linear combinations), the transformed points will follow a pattern.\n\nThe transformation T will map each parametric point to:\nT(t, (-a/b)t - c/b) = A[t, (-a/b)t - c/b]\u1d40\n\nBecause matrix multiplication is distributive and homogeneous, this will result in a new parametric equation where each coordinate is a linear function of t. When we eliminate the parameter t from these equations, we get a linear equation in the new coordinates, which represents a line in the transformed space.\n\nThe only exception would be if the transformation collapses the line to a point, which can happen if the matrix A is not full rank. However, even in this case, a point can be considered a degenerate case of a line.\n\nTherefore, the image of the original line under the linear transformation T must be a line (or a point) in \u211d\u00b2, as the transformation preserves linear relationships between points.\nPrevious attempt failed with: expected token\nfunction expected at\n  T\nterm has type\n  \u211d\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: expected token\nexpected token\nunexpected token ','; expected '\u21a6', '=>'\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: expected token\nunexpected token ','; expected ':', ']' or ']''\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

From the context, we know that in an obtuse triangle, one angle is greater than 90 degrees. For triangle BPC to be obtuse, we need to determine when angle BPC is greater than 90 degrees.\n\nThe key insight is that for any point P, we can use the following geometric property: angle BPC is obtuse if and only if P lies inside the circle whose diameter is BC. This is because of the well-known theorem that states that angles inscribed in a semicircle are 90 degrees, and angles inscribed in a smaller arc are obtuse.\n\nIn our square:\n1. Points B and C are two vertices of the square, separated by 2 units (BC = 2)\n2. The circle whose diameter is BC has its center at the midpoint of BC\n3. This circle has radius 1 unit (half of BC)\n\nTo find the probability, we need to:\n1. Calculate the area where P makes triangle BPC obtuse\n2. Divide this by the total area where P can be located (the square's area)\n\nThe area where P makes triangle BPC obtuse is the intersection of:\n- The circle whose diameter is BC\n- The square ABCD\n\nSince BC is a side of the square, exactly half of this circle lies inside the square. The area of the full circle is \u03c0 square units (\u03c0 \u00d7 r\u00b2 where r = 1), so the area where P makes an obtuse triangle is \u03c0/2 square units.\n\nThe total area of the square is 4 square units (2 \u00d7 2).\n\nTherefore, the probability that triangle BPC is obtuse is:\n(\u03c0/2) \u00f7 4 = \u03c0/8 \u2248 0.3927 or about 39.27%\n\nThis solution relies on:\n- The geometric property of angles inscribed in a circle\n- The relationship between obtuse angles and their position relative to a circle's diameter\n- Basic area calculations for circles and squares\n- The concept of uniform random distribution\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\nambiguous, possible interpretations \n  \u03c0 : \u2115 \u2192 \u2115\n  \n  \u03c0 : \u211d\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'circle_radius', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'obtuse_probability', and it does not have executable code\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown namespace 'MeasureTheory'\nunknown namespace 'Real'\nexpected token\ntype mismatch\n  x\nhas type\n  \u211d : Sort ?u.27\nbut is expected to have type\n  Prop : Type\nunknown constant 'sorryAx'\nexpected token\nunexpected token '|'; expected term\nexpected line break or token\nexpected token\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown namespace 'MeasureTheory'\nunknown namespace 'Real'\nexpected token\ntype mismatch\n  x\nhas type\n  \u211d : Sort ?u.27\nbut is expected to have type\n  Prop : Type\nunknown constant 'sorryAx'\nexpected token\nunexpected token '|'; expected term\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunknown constant 'sorryAx'\ntype of theorem 'obtuse_probability' is not a proposition\n  {\u211d : Sort u_1} \u2192 \u211d\nunexpected token 'let'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nunknown identifier 'obtuse_probability'\nunknown constant 'sorryAx'\nPlease revise the proof.",

We have two numbers: 'a' which is even, and 'b' which is odd. Being even means that 'a' can be written as 2 times some integer - it has no remainder when divided by 2. Being odd means that 'b' can be written as 2 times some integer plus 1 - it has a remainder of 1 when divided by 2.\n\nSo when we add these numbers together, here's what happens:\n- The even number 'a' contributes some multiple of 2\n- The odd number 'b' contributes some multiple of 2 plus 1\n\nWhen we add these together, all the multiples of 2 combine to give us another multiple of 2, and we still have that extra 1 left over from the odd number. This means the sum must be some multiple of 2 plus 1, which is the definition of an odd number.\n\nTo put it another way, think of building the sum with pairs of units. The even number consists of complete pairs, while the odd number consists of complete pairs plus one extra unit. When we combine them, we still end up with complete pairs plus that one extra unit, making the result odd.\n\nThis reasoning shows that no matter which even number and which odd number we choose, their sum will always be odd because the \"evenness\" (complete pairs) combines with \"oddness\" (complete pairs plus one) to give us complete pairs plus one - an odd number.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unsolved goals\ncase h\na b k : \u2124\nhk : a = k + k\nl : \u2124\nhl : b = 2 * l + 1\n\u22a2 1 + k * 2 + l * 2 = 3 + k * 2 + l * 2\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unsolved goals\ncase h\na b k : \u2124\nhk : a = k + k\nl : \u2124\nhl : b = 2 * l + 1\n\u22a2 1 + k * 2 + l * 2 = 3 + k * 2 + l * 2\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unsolved goals\ncase h\na b k : \u2124\nhk : a = k + k\nl : \u2124\nhl : b = 2 * l + 1\n\u22a2 1 + k * 2 + l * 2 = 3 + k * 2 + l * 2\nPlease revise the proof.",

This means that when we multiply any number by 1, we don't change the quantity of what we started with.\n\nThink of it this way: when we multiply a number by 1, we're essentially taking one complete copy of that number - no more, no less. For example, if we have 5 \u00d7 1, we're taking one group of five, which is just 5. Similarly, if we have 1 \u00d7 5, we're taking five one time, which again is just 5.\n\nThis works for any number because multiplication by 1 doesn't scale or shrink the original number - it preserves exactly what we started with. Whether we're dealing with positive numbers, negative numbers, or zero, multiplying by 1 always gives us back our original number.\n\nThis property is so fundamental that it's one of the basic rules of arithmetic, and it's what makes 1 the multiplicative identity. It's like having a mirror that shows exactly what's placed in front of it, neither magnifying nor shrinking the image.\n\nThe same logic applies whether we multiply 1 first (1 \u00d7 n) or multiply by 1 after (n \u00d7 1) - in both cases, we get back our original number n.

We need to sum all these values and divide by 20\n\nTo make the addition easier, we can first group similar values:\n- 87 appears once\n- 88 appears twice\n- 90 appears three times\n- 92 appears three times\n- 93 appears twice\n- 94 appears two times\n- 95 appears three times\n- 96 appears twice\n- 97 appears twice\n\nSo the sum would be:\n(87 \u00d7 1) + (88 \u00d7 2) + (90 \u00d7 3) + (92 \u00d7 3) + (93 \u00d7 2) + (94 \u00d7 2) + (95 \u00d7 3) + (96 \u00d7 2) + (97 \u00d7 2)\n= 87 + 176 + 270 + 276 + 186 + 188 + 285 + 192 + 194\n= 1854\n\nThen, to get the mean, we divide this sum by the total number of students (20):\n1854 \u00f7 20 = 92.7\n\nTherefore, the mean (average) mark for the class is 92.7 out of 100.\n\nThis represents the central tendency of the marks, indicating that the class performed quite well overall, with an average above 90%.",

Here's how we can think about it:\n\nFirst, imagine building the sphere layer by layer. Each point in the sphere can be uniquely described by:\n- Its distance r from the center (ranging from 0 to the sphere's radius R)\n- Its angle \u03c6 from the positive z-axis (ranging from 0 to \u03c0)\n- Its angle \u03b8 in the xy-plane from the positive x-axis (ranging from 0 to 2\u03c0)\n\nWhen we use these coordinates, we can think about the volume element dV as a tiny piece of the sphere. This element isn't a simple cube - it's more like a tiny wedge whose size depends on all three coordinates:\n- As we move farther from the center (larger r), the size of the element grows proportionally to r\u00b2\n- As we move away from the z-axis (\u03c6 changing), we need to account for the \"spreading out\" effect, which gives us the sin(\u03c6) term\n- As we rotate around the z-axis (\u03b8 changing), we complete the description of the volume element\n\nTo get the total volume, we need to add up (integrate) all these tiny pieces:\n- Integrate over r from 0 to R to account for all distances from the center\n- Integrate over \u03c6 from 0 to \u03c0 to cover all angles from the z-axis\n- Integrate over \u03b8 from 0 to 2\u03c0 to make a complete rotation\n\nWhen we evaluate this triple integral, we'll get the same result as the disk method shown in the context (4\u03c0R\u00b3/3), but we're approaching it from a different perspective - building the sphere from infinitesimal volume elements in spherical coordinates rather than stacking circular disks.\n\nThis approach is particularly elegant because it directly reflects the spherical symmetry of the shape we're measuring, and each term in the volume element dV has a clear geometric interpretation in terms of how space \"stretches\" as we move through the sphere.",

We have an equation 3x + 4 = 2x + 7, and we need to show that if this equation has a solution, that solution must be x = 3.\n\nHere's how we can reason about this:\n\n1. Let's start by assuming the equation has a solution. This means there is some number x that makes both sides equal.\n\n2. Since both sides of the equation are equal, we can subtract the right side from both sides to get everything on one side:\n   (3x + 4) - (2x + 7) = 0\n\n3. This can be simplified by combining like terms:\n   - First, the terms with x: 3x - 2x gives us x\n   - Then the numbers: 4 - 7 gives us -3\n   So we have: x - 3 = 0\n\n4. This is a very simple equation that can only be satisfied when x equals 3.\n\n5. To verify this is actually a solution, we can plug x = 3 back into the original equation:\n   - Left side: 3(3) + 4 = 9 + 4 = 13\n   - Right side: 2(3) + 7 = 6 + 7 = 13\n   The equation balances, confirming x = 3 is indeed a solution.\n\nTherefore, if the equation has a solution, that solution must be x = 3, because:\n- We showed that any solution must satisfy x - 3 = 0\n- We verified that x = 3 actually works in the original equation\n- The algebraic steps we used were reversible, so we haven't introduced any extraneous solutions\n\nThis proves that x = 3 is the only possible solution to the equation.",

We have a right triangle with legs of lengths a and b, and a hypotenuse of length c. The key insight is that we can use the geometric properties of squares to establish this relationship.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. Start by drawing a larger square with side length (a + b). This creates a canvas for our proof.\n\n2. Inside this large square, we can construct four copies of our original right triangle by arranging them to form a smaller square in the middle.\n\n3. When we arrange these triangles:\n   - Each triangle has legs of length a and b\n   - The triangles are arranged so their hypotenuses form a square in the middle\n   - This middle square has sides of length c (the hypotenuse length)\n\n4. Now we have two ways to calculate the area of the large square:\n   - First way: The large square has side length (a + b), so its area is (a + b)\u00b2\n   - Second way: The large square consists of:\n     * Four right triangles (each with area ab/2)\n     * One middle square (with area c\u00b2)\n\n5.

The key insight is that the derivative tells us about the rate of change of the function, and a zero derivative means there is no change at all.\n\nHere's how we can think about this:\n\nFirst, let's take any two points x\u2081 and x\u2082 in our interval (a, b). To show the function is constant, we need to prove that f(x\u2081) = f(x\u2082). If we can show this for any arbitrary points, then we've proven the function never changes value.\n\nThe Mean Value Theorem gives us a powerful tool here. It tells us that between any two points, there must be at least one point where the instantaneous rate of change (the derivative) equals the average rate of change between those points.\n\nSo, between our points x\u2081 and x\u2082, there must be some point c where:\nf'(c) = [f(x\u2082) - f(x\u2081)] / (x\u2082 - x\u2081)\n\nBut we know that f'(x) = 0 everywhere in the interval, including at point c. Therefore:\n0 = [f(x\u2082) - f(x\u2081)] / (x\u2082 - x\u2081)\n\nMultiply both sides by (x\u2082 - x\u2081):\n0 = f(x\u2082) - f(x\u2081)\n\nAdd f(x\u2081) to both sides:\nf(x\u2081) = f(x\u2082)\n\nSince x\u2081 and x\u2082 were arbitrary points in our interval, this shows that f takes the same value everywhere in the interval. That's exactly what it means to be constant.\n\nThe intuition here is that if a function's rate of change is always zero, it can never increase or decrease as we move along the x-axis, so it must maintain the same value throughout its domain.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unexpected token '\u2208'; expected ','\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unexpected token '\u2208'; expected ','\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unexpected token '\u2208'; expected ','\nPlease revise the proof.",

To find its limit as x approaches 4, we can think about what happens to the function's values when x gets arbitrarily close to 4.\n\nWhen we input values very close to 4 into the function, the outputs will be very close to what we get when we directly calculate f(4). This is because linear functions are well-behaved - small changes in input lead to proportionally small changes in output.\n\nLet's think about what happens when we actually calculate f(4):\n1. We substitute x = 4 into f(x) = 3x + 2\n2. This gives us f(4) = 3(4) + 2\n3. Which equals 12 + 2 = 14\n\nBecause the function is linear and therefore continuous, as x gets closer and closer to 4 (from either direction), f(x) will get closer and closer to 14. There are no jumps or discontinuities that would prevent the function from reaching this value.\n\nTherefore, the limit of f(x) = 3x + 2 as x approaches 4 must be 14. This matches exactly what we get when we directly compute f(4), which is what we expect for a continuous function.\nPrevious attempt failed with: function expected at\n  Tendsto\nterm has type\n  ?m.3\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: function expected at\n  Tendsto\nterm has type\n  ?m.3\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: function expected at\n  Tendsto\nterm has type\n  ?m.3\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

First, we know that to find the definite integral of 2x, we need to:\n   - Find the antiderivative (primitive) of 2x\n   - Evaluate it at the upper and lower bounds\n   - Take the difference\n\n2. For the function 2x:\n   - The coefficient 2 can be pulled out front\n   - x has a power of 1\n   - When we integrate x, we increase the power by 1 and divide by this new power\n   - So the antiderivative of 2x is x\u00b2\n\n3.

Apply the perimeter formula to these new dimensions\n\nThe new length will be 8 + (-5) = 3 units\nThe new width will be -3 + 2 = -1 units\n\nNow we can find the perimeter using the formula 2a + 2b, where 'a' is the new length (3) and 'b' is the new width (-1).\n\nTherefore, the perimeter will be:\n2(3) + 2(-1) = 6 - 2 = 4 units\n\nThe negative values in the dimensions might seem counterintuitive in a physical sense, but mathematically we can still apply the perimeter formula and get a valid result.

We start with the left side of the equation: 5a + 3b\n2. We know that a = 1, so we can substitute this:\n   - 5(1) + 3b\n   - This simplifies to 5 + 3b\n3.

For the equation to be balanced, 11 should equal 15\n   - However, 11 \u2260 15\n   - Therefore, this equation is not actually balanced with these values\n\nThe conclusion is that the original premise is false - the equation 5a + 3b = 15 is not balanced when a = 1 and b = 2. This is because the left side evaluates to 11 while the right side is 15, and 11 \u2260 15.\n\nThis proof demonstrates that the given statement is incorrect through direct computation and comparison of both sides of the equation.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unsolved goals\n\u22a2 False\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unsolved goals\n\u22a2 False\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unsolved goals\n\u22a2 False\nPlease revise the proof.",

First, let's understand what it means for A to be a multiple of B. This means that A can be written as A = nB, where n is some integer.\n\n2. Now, when we multiply A by x, we get:\n   x \u00d7 A = x \u00d7 (nB)\n\n3. Using the associative property of multiplication, we can rewrite this as:\n   x \u00d7 A = (x \u00d7 n) \u00d7 B\n\n4. Here's the key insight: when we multiply x and n together, we get another number (let's call it k = x \u00d7 n). This k is also a real number.\n\n5. So x \u00d7 A = kB, where k is a real number.\n\n6. Therefore, xA is still expressible as some number multiplied by B, which means it maintains the fundamental relationship of being a multiple of B.\n\nThe crucial point is that multiplication is closed and associative for real numbers, so when we multiply a multiple of B by any real number, we're just changing the factor by which we're multiplying B, but we're not breaking the relationship of one number being a multiple of another.\n\nThis shows that if A is a multiple of B, then xA is also a multiple of B for any real number x.\n\nNote: While the original multiple relationship involved integers (as A was an integer multiple of B), the resulting relationship after multiplication by x will involve real number multiples, but the divisibility relationship is preserved.",

When we have (a+b), we're first combining two vectors to get a single resultant vector\n2. Then when we multiply by c, we're scaling this combined vector by a factor of c\n3. This scaling operation stretches or shrinks (and possibly flips if c is negative) the entire vector uniformly\n\nOn the other hand:\n1. When we have c*a and c*b separately, we're scaling each vector individually by the same factor c\n2. Then we're adding these scaled vectors together\n\nThe reason these operations must give the same result comes from the fundamental properties of vector spaces:\n- Vector addition is essentially combining displacements\n- Scalar multiplication is uniform scaling\n- The order in which we perform these operations shouldn't matter because scaling preserves the relative relationships between vectors\n\nIt's similar to how regular multiplication distributes over addition with regular numbers (like 3(4+5) = 3\u00d74 + 3\u00d75), but now we're working with vectors instead of numbers. The underlying principle is the same - the scaling factor c affects each component of the sum in the same way, whether we apply it before or after the addition.\n\nThis property is essential for vector spaces to behave consistently and is one of the fundamental axioms that make vector algebra work as we expect it to.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

Thus, \u00acQ implies \u00acP\n\nSecond Direction (\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP implies P \u2192 Q):\n1. Assume \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP is true\n2. To prove P \u2192 Q, let's assume P is true\n3. If Q were false (\u00acQ), then by our assumption (\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP), \u00acP would be true\n4. But this contradicts our assumption that P is true\n5. Therefore, Q cannot be false, meaning Q must be true\n6.

We'll prove that the Laplace transform of an integral equals the Laplace transform of the original function divided by s.\n\nThe main insight is to use the relationship between differentiation and integration, along with a key property of the Laplace transform of derivatives. Here's how we can think about it:\n\nFirst, let's consider the integral of our function f(t) from 0 to t, which we'll call g(t). So g(t) = \u222b\u2080\u1d57 f(u)du. This means that g(t) is the antiderivative of f(t), or in other words, g'(t) = f(t).\n\nNow, we know two important things about g(t):\n1. Its derivative equals our original function: g'(t) = f(t)\n2. When t = 0, the integral equals zero: g(0) = 0\n\nHere's where we can use a crucial property of Laplace transforms: the Laplace transform of a derivative. This property states that L[g'(t)] = sL[g(t)] - g(0), where s is the Laplace transform variable.\n\nSince we know g'(t) = f(t), we can write:\nL[f(t)] = sL[g(t)] - g(0)\n\nAnd since g(0) = 0, this simplifies to:\nL[f(t)] = sL[g(t)]\n\nNow, remember that g(t) is our integral function, so L[g(t)] is what we're trying to find. We can solve for it:\nL[g(t)] = L[f(t)]/s\n\nThis is exactly what we wanted to prove: the Laplace transform of the integral equals the Laplace transform of the original function divided by s.\n\nThe intuition behind this result is that integration and division by s in the Laplace domain are corresponding operations - integration in the time domain corresponds to division by s in the frequency domain.\nPrevious attempt failed with: invalid field notation, type is not of the form (C ...) where C is a constant\n  set\nhas type\n  ?m.242 \u2192 ?m.243 PUnit.{?u.241 + 1}\nunknown identifier 'complex.exp'\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.measureSpace', and it does not have executable code\ninvalid field notation, type is not of the form (C ...) where C is a constant\n  set\nhas type\n  ?m.740 \u2192 ?m.741 PUnit.{?u.739 + 1}\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.measureSpace', and it does not have executable code\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown namespace 'Real'\nexpected token\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown namespace 'Real'\nexpected token\nexpected token\nexpected token\nPlease revise the proof.",

Since f(x) is non-negative, this means we're always adding up positive (or zero) values when we integrate.\n\nThe key insight is that when we integrate from a to c, we're taking a \"piece\" of the total area that we know equals 1. Since c is somewhere in [a,b], this piece cannot be larger than the whole. It's like cutting a pie - any slice must be smaller than or equal to the whole pie.\n\nMore specifically:\n1. We know that f(x) \u2265 0 for all x in [a,b]\n2. The integral from a to b equals 1\n3. When we integrate from a to c, we're taking a subset of the interval [a,b]\n4. Since we're integrating non-negative values over a smaller interval, this partial integral must be less than or equal to the integral over the full interval\n\nThis is essentially a consequence of the additive property of integrals - if we split the integral at point c, we get:\n\nThe integral from a to b = (The integral from a to c) + (The integral from c to b)\n\nSince f(x) is non-negative, the integral from c to b must be non-negative.

The same principle of multiplying length by width applies to both rectangles.\n\nThe difference in area between the two rectangles is small - just 1 square unit - but this still definitively shows that Rectangle A is larger in terms of area, even though Rectangle B might appear more symmetrical due to being a square.\n\nTherefore, Rectangle A has the larger area.",

        "informal_proof": "# Informal Proof:\n\nLet me explain why the sum of residuals in a simple linear regression model must equal zero. This is a fundamental property of least squares regression.\n\nFirst, let's understand what we're working with. The residuals are the differences between the actual y values (yi) and the predicted values (\u0177i) from our regression line. When we fit a regression line using the method of least squares, we're finding the values of \u03b20 and \u03b21 that minimize the sum of squared residuals.\n\nThe key insight comes from how we find these optimal values of \u03b20 and \u03b21. In the least squares method, we take partial derivatives of the sum of squared residuals with respect to \u03b20 and set it equal to zero to find the minimum. This leads to a crucial condition.\n\nWhen we take the partial derivative with respect to \u03b20 (the y-intercept), we're essentially asking how the sum of squared residuals changes when we shift the regression line up or down. At the optimal position, any slight shift up or down should not improve our fit. This can only happen when the residuals are perfectly balanced above and below the line.\n\nMathematically, this means that when we optimize \u03b20, we're requiring that:\n\u2211(yi - \u0177i) = 0\n\nIf this sum weren't zero, we could improve our fit by shifting the line up or down slightly. For example, if the sum of residuals were positive, it would mean our line is generally too low and could be improved by shifting it up.\n\nThis is also intuitive geometrically: the regression line must \"balance\" the points above and below it. The positive residuals (points above the line) must exactly cancel out the negative residuals (points below the line) when we add them all up.\n\nTherefore, by the very nature of how we find the optimal regression line using least squares, the sum of residuals must equal zero. This is a necessary condition for the line to be the best possible fit to our data points.\nPrevious attempt failed with: type expected, got\n  (\u03b5 : \u211d)\nexpected token\n'residual' has already been declared\napplication type mismatch\n  List.zipWith residual\nargument\n  residual\nhas type\n  (X : Type ?u.979) \u2192 [inst : TopologicalSpace X] \u2192 Filter X : Type (?u.979 + 1)\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u211d \u2192 \u211d \u2192 \u211d : Type\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  List.zipWith ?f (List.map ?g ?l\u2081) (List.map ?h ?l\u2082)\n\u03b20 \u03b21 x y \u03b5 : \u211d\nxs ys : List \u211d\nh : xs.length = ys.length\n\u22a2 sorryAx (List \u211d \u2192 List \u211d \u2192 \u211d) true xs ys = 0\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: 'residual' has already been declared\napplication type mismatch\n  @residual x\nargument\n  x\nhas type\n  List \u211d : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  Type ?u.11845 : Type (?u.11845 + 1)\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: 'residual' has already been declared\nfunction expected at\n  residual x\u271d\u00b9\nterm has type\n  Filter x\u271d\u00b9\nunknown constant 'List.sum_zipWith'\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, equality or iff proof expected\n  ?m.3011\nxs ys : List \u211d\n\u03b20 \u03b21 : \u211d\nh : xs.length = ys.length\n\u22a2 (List.zipWith (fun x x => sorryAx \u211d true) (sorryAx (List (Type u_1)) true) ys).sum = 0\nPlease revise the proof.",

The total number of possible outcomes (drawing any ball)\n\nFirst, let's determine the total number of balls in the jar:\n- There are 5 red balls\n- There are 3 blue balls\n- There are 2 green balls\n- So the total number of balls is 5 + 3 + 2 = 10 balls\n\nWhen drawing a single ball, each ball has an equal chance of being selected. The probability is calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nIn this case:\n- The number of favorable outcomes is 5 (the number of red balls)\n- The total number of possible outcomes is 10 (the total number of balls)\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing a red ball is 5/10 = 1/2 or 0.5 or 50%.\n\nThis follows from the classical definition of probability where:\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n\nThe answer is 1/2, meaning there is a 50% chance of drawing a red ball from the jar.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

We can treat these as two separate hypothesis tests.\n\nFor both parts, we'll use the fact that when we have a large enough sample (n \u2265 30, which we do), the sampling distribution of the mean follows a normal distribution according to the Central Limit Theorem.\n\nFor the real parts:\n- Population mean (\u03bc_real) = 5\n- Sample mean (x\u0304_real) = 4.8\n- Sample standard deviation (s_real) = 1\n- Sample size (n) = 30\n\nFor the imaginary parts:\n- Population mean (\u03bc_imag) = 3\n- Sample mean (x\u0304_imag) = 2.9\n- Sample standard deviation (s_imag) = 0.8\n- Sample size (n) = 30\n\nFor each component, we can calculate a z-score using the formula:\nz = (sample mean - population mean)/(standard deviation/\u221an)\n\nFor the real parts:\nz_real = (4.8 - 5)/(1/\u221a30) = -1.095\n\nFor the imaginary parts:\nz_imag = (2.9 - 3)/(0.8/\u221a30) = -0.687\n\nAt the 5% level of significance with a two-tailed test, the critical z-values are \u00b11.96. Since both of our calculated z-scores fall within these critical values (-1.095 and -0.687 are both between -1.96 and 1.96), we cannot reject the null hypothesis.\n\nTherefore, this sample is not significantly different from the population at the 5% level of significance.

The sphere touches all six faces of the parallelepiped\n2. The parallelepiped has dimensions a, b, and c\n3. The sphere must be centered at the center of the parallelepiped\n\nThe key insight is that when a sphere touches the faces of a rectangular parallelepiped:\n- The diameter of the sphere must equal the height (c)\n- The diameter must equal the width (b)\n- The diameter must equal the length (a)\n\nThis means that if we call the radius of the sphere r:\n- 2r = a\n- 2r = b\n- 2r = c\n\nTherefore, a = b = c = 2r.

We have:\n- Two vectors u and v\n- A scalar c\n- We know that the slope of u is twice the slope of v\n- We need to prove that the slope of (cu + v) equals the slope of u\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\nWhen we talk about the slope of a vector, we're essentially talking about how much it rises in relation to how much it runs (its vertical component divided by its horizontal component). If we know that the slope of u is twice the slope of v, we can express this mathematically, but let's think about what happens geometrically.\n\nWhen we multiply a vector by a scalar c, we stretch or compress the vector while maintaining its direction (or flip it if c is negative). This operation doesn't change the slope of the vector. So cu will have the same slope as u.\n\nNow, when we add vectors, we use the parallelogram law of vector addition. The resulting vector (cu + v) will be the diagonal of the parallelogram formed by cu and v.\n\nThe key insight is that when one vector has a slope that's twice that of another vector, and we add them together (after scaling one of them), the resulting vector's slope will be \"pulled\" more strongly toward the slope of the vector with the larger magnitude.\n\nIn this case, since u's slope is twice v's slope, and we're scaling u by c, the slope of cu will dominate the slope of v in the sum (cu + v), causing the resulting vector to have the same slope as u.\n\nThis happens because the vertical and horizontal components combine in such a way that the ratio of the final vertical component to the final horizontal component equals the slope of u, due to the proportional relationship between the slopes of the original vectors.\n\nTherefore, the slope of the resulting vector (cu + v) must equal the slope of u.\nPrevious attempt failed with: invalid binder annotation, type is not a class instance\n  ?m.12\nuse the command `set_option checkBinderAnnotations false` to disable the check\n'slope' has already been declared\nfailed to synthesize\n  HMul \u2115 (?m.3100 \u2192 ?m.3100 \u2192 ?m.3102) (?m.56 \u2192 ?m.56 \u2192 ?m.58)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\napplication type mismatch\n  slope v\nargument\n  v\nhas type\n  V : Sort ?u.45\nbut is expected to have type\n  ?m.3100 \u2192 ?m.3103 : Type (max ?u.3097 ?u.3099)\nfailed to synthesize\n  HSMul \u211d V ?m.33205\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\napplication type mismatch\n  slope u\nargument\n  u\nhas type\n  V : Type ?u.31866\nbut is expected to have type\n  ?m.31854 \u2192 ?m.36542 : Type (max ?u.31851 ?u.36538)\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: 'slope' has already been declared\nfailed to synthesize\n  HMul \u2115 (?m.16650 \u2192 ?m.16650 \u2192 ?m.16652) (?m.13668 \u2192 ?m.13668 \u2192 ?m.13670)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\napplication type mismatch\n  slope v\nargument\n  v\nhas type\n  V : Type u_1\nbut is expected to have type\n  ?m.16650 \u2192 ?m.16653 : Type (max ?u.16647 ?u.16649)\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: 'slope' has already been declared\nfailed to synthesize\n  HMul \u2115 (?m.15994 \u2192 ?m.15994 \u2192 ?m.15996) (?m.13012 \u2192 ?m.13012 \u2192 ?m.13014)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\napplication type mismatch\n  slope v\nargument\n  v\nhas type\n  V : Type ?u.12358\nbut is expected to have type\n  ?m.15994 \u2192 ?m.15997 : Type (max ?u.15991 ?u.15993)\nPlease revise the proof.",

Since each cubic centimeter has a mass of 2 grams, the total mass would be 125 \u00d7 2 = 250 grams.\n\nThis is a straightforward application of the relationship between volume and mass, using the fact that a cube's volume is the cube of its side length, and that mass is uniformly distributed throughout the cube at 2 grams per cubic centimeter.\n\nTherefore, the cube has a total mass of 250 grams.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'calc'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'calc'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'calc'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

It's like trying to compare length with area - they are different dimensional measurements and cannot be directly compared.\n\nThe volume of a cylinder is a three-dimensional measurement (cubic units), while the area of a circle is a two-dimensional measurement (square units). These quantities exist in different dimensional spaces and cannot be meaningfully compared in terms of which is \"more than\" the other.\n\nThis proof demonstrates why the original question contains a logical flaw and cannot be answered as stated.

Here's the intuitive reasoning:\n\nFirst, recall that the Laplace transform of a function f(t) is defined as the integral:\nF(s) = \u222b\u2080^\u221e f(t)e^(-st) dt\n\nThe key to proving continuity is to show that if we take any point s\u2080 where F(s) exists, and look at nearby points s, F(s) will be arbitrarily close to F(s\u2080) when s is sufficiently close to s\u2080.\n\nHere's why this is true:\n\n1. Since f(t) is continuous on [0,A] for any finite A, and e^(-st) is continuous for any fixed s, their product f(t)e^(-st) is continuous in t.\n\n2. When we look at how F(s) changes as s changes slightly from s\u2080 to s\u2080+h, we're really looking at the difference:\n   |F(s\u2080+h) - F(s\u2080)| = |\u222b\u2080^\u221e f(t)(e^(-(s\u2080+h)t) - e^(-s\u2080t)) dt|\n\n3. The exponential term e^(-st) varies continuously with s, and this continuous variation preserves through the integration because:\n   - For small values of t, the exponential terms are very close\n   - For large values of t, both exponential terms become very small\n   - The continuous function f(t) keeps everything well-behaved in between\n\n4. The existence of the Laplace transform means the integral converges, so the tail of the integral (for large t) contributes arbitrarily little to the difference.\n\n5. Therefore, for any \u03b5 > 0, we can find a \u03b4 > 0 such that when |h| < \u03b4, |F(s\u2080+h) - F(s\u2080)| < \u03b5, which is the definition of continuity.\n\nThe key insight is that the smoothing effect of integration, combined with the well-behaved nature of the exponential function, preserves the continuity of the original function through the transform.\nPrevious attempt failed with: invalid field notation, type is not of the form (C ...) where C is a constant\n  set\nhas type\n  ?m.242 \u2192 ?m.243 PUnit.{?u.241 + 1}\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.measureSpace', and it does not have executable code\ninvalid binder annotation, type is not a class instance\n  Continuous f\nuse the command `set_option checkBinderAnnotations false` to disable the check\nunexpected token ','; expected '\u21a6', '=>'\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: invalid field notation, type is not of the form (C ...) where C is a constant\n  set\nhas type\n  ?m.242 \u2192 ?m.243 PUnit.{?u.241 + 1}\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.measureSpace', and it does not have executable code\nunknown identifier 'continuous_of_continuous_on_of_isCompact'\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.measureSpace', and it does not have executable code\nunknown identifier 'continuous_of_continuous_on_of_isCompact'\nPlease revise the proof.",

This is important because it means we can apply key theorems about continuous functions.\n\nBecause f(x) is continuous on the closed interval [a,b], by the Extreme Value Theorem, we know that f(x) must attain both its minimum value k and its maximum value m somewhere in this interval. In other words, there must be some points in [a,b] where f(x) = k and f(x) = m.\n\nNow, think about what this means geometrically. When we take the definite integral of f(x) from a to b, we're finding the area between the curve and the x-axis (taking into account negative areas below the x-axis). At every point x in [a,b], the height of the curve f(x) must be greater than or equal to k (the minimum) and less than or equal to m (the maximum).\n\nIf we were to draw a horizontal line at height k, the actual curve f(x) would always be above or equal to this line. Therefore, the area under f(x) must be at least as large as the area of the rectangle with height k and width (b-a), which is (b-a)*k.\n\nSimilarly, if we draw a horizontal line at height m, the actual curve f(x) would always be below or equal to this line. Therefore, the area under f(x) must be no larger than the area of the rectangle with height m and width (b-a), which is (b-a)*m.\n\nPutting this together mathematically:\n- The minimum possible area is (b-a)*k\n- The maximum possible area is (b-a)*m\n- The actual integral must lie between these values\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that:\n(b-a)*k \u2264 \u222b[a to b] f(x)dx \u2264 (b-a)*m\n\nThis result holds true regardless of the specific values of a and b, as long as we know the minimum and maximum values of f(x) on that interval.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'integral_le_of_le_on'\nunknown identifier 'integral_le_of_le_on'\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown namespace 'Set'\nunknown constant 'OfNat'\nunknown constant 'sorryAx'\nunknown constant 'sorryAx'\nunexpected token '*'; expected command\nexpected token\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown namespace 'Set'\nunknown constant 'OfNat'\nunknown constant 'sorryAx'\nunknown constant 'sorryAx'\nunexpected token '*'; expected command\nunknown identifier 'Classical.choose'\nunknown constant 'sorryAx'\nunknown constant 'sorryAx'\nunknown identifier 'Classical.choose'\nunknown constant 'sorryAx'\nunknown constant 'sorryAx'\nexpected token\nPlease revise the proof.",

It could also be what's called a \"saddle point.\"\n\nHere's the intuitive reasoning:\n\n1. When both partial derivatives are zero at a point, it means the tangent planes in both the x and y directions are horizontal at that point. In other words, as we move along either the x-axis or y-axis through (a,b), the instantaneous rate of change is zero.\n\n2. However, this doesn't tell us about what happens when we move in other directions through the point (a,b). The function could be increasing in some directions and decreasing in others.\n\n3. A classic counterexample is the function f(x,y) = x\u00b2 - y\u00b2. At the point (0,0):\n   - The partial derivative with respect to x is 2x, which equals 0 at (0,0)\n   - The partial derivative with respect to y is -2y, which equals 0 at (0,0)\n   - But (0,0) is not a local maximum or minimum\n\n4.

A negative number can be thought of as the opposite of a positive number - it's what you get when you take a positive number and flip its sign. For example, -3 is the opposite of 3.\n\nWhen we multiply two numbers, we can think about it in terms of repeated addition and direction. Multiplying by a negative number not only involves the magnitude (how many times we add), but also involves reversing direction.\n\nHere's the key insight: When we multiply two negative numbers, we get a \"double reversal\" of direction, which puts us back into positive territory. Let's break this down:\n\n1. When we multiply by the first negative number, we're essentially saying \"take the second number and reverse its direction\"\n2. But since the second number is also negative, we're actually reversing a negative\n3. Reversing a negative gives us a positive\n\nWe can also think about this in terms of patterns:\n- Positive \u00d7 Positive = Positive\n- Positive \u00d7 Negative = Negative\n- Negative \u00d7 Positive = Negative\n- Negative \u00d7 Negative = Positive\n\nThis last case must be positive to maintain consistency in our number system and to preserve important algebraic properties. If it were negative, many fundamental properties of multiplication (like the distributive property) would break down.\n\nTherefore, any time we multiply two negative real numbers, the result must be positive. The magnitude of the result will be the product of the magnitudes of the original numbers, but the sign will be positive due to this double reversal principle.\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  neg_pos_of_neg ha\nargument\n  ha\nhas type\n  a < 0 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  -a < 0 : Prop\napplication type mismatch\n  neg_pos_of_neg hb\nargument\n  hb\nhas type\n  b < 0 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  -b < 0 : Prop\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "# Informal Proof:\n\nLet me explain why if a function's derivative is zero over an interval, then the function must be constant over that interval, and therefore have equal values at the endpoints.\n\nThe key insight is that a derivative of zero means the function has no rate of change at any point in the interval. Let's think about what this means:\n\nWhen f'(x) = 0 at a point, it tells us that the function is neither increasing nor decreasing at that point - it's flat there. In this case, we have f'(x) = 0 for every single point in the interval (x1, x2). This means the function is flat everywhere in this interval.\n\nTo understand why this makes f(x1) = f(x2), imagine trying to get from point x1 to point x2 while walking along the graph of the function. Since the derivative is zero everywhere along your path, you can never go up or down - you can only move horizontally. It's like walking on perfectly level ground from one point to another.\n\nIf we could find any two points in this interval where f had different values, there would have to be some change in height (some increase or decrease) between those points. But this would require a non-zero derivative somewhere between them, which contradicts our given condition that f'(x) = 0 everywhere in the interval.\n\nTherefore, since the function can't change its value anywhere in the interval (x1, x2), it must have the same value at both endpoints. In other words, f(x1) = f(x2).\n\nThis is essentially a consequence of the fundamental relationship between a function's derivative and its behavior - the derivative tells us about change, and zero derivative means no change.\nPrevious attempt failed with: function expected at\n  Ioo\nterm has type\n  ?m.91\nfunction expected at\n  Ioo\nterm has type\n  x\u271d\nunsolved goals\nx\u271d : Sort u_1\nIoo : x\u271d\nf : \u211d \u2192 \u211d\nx1 x2 : \u211d\nh : x1 < x2\nhf : \u2200 x \u2208 ?m.1606 f x1 x2 h x, HasDerivAt f 0 x\n\u22a2 f x1 = f x2\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: function expected at\n  Ioo\nterm has type\n  ?m.91\nfunction expected at\n  Ioo\nterm has type\n  x\u271d\nunsolved goals\nx\u271d : Sort u_1\nIoo : x\u271d\nf : \u211d \u2192 \u211d\nx1 x2 : \u211d\nh : x1 < x2\nhf : \u2200 x \u2208 ?m.1606 f x1 x2 h x, HasDerivAt f 0 x\n\u22a2 f x1 = f x2\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: function expected at\n  Ioo\nterm has type\n  ?m.91\nfunction expected at\n  Ioo\nterm has type\n  x\u271d\nunsolved goals\nx\u271d : Sort u_1\nIoo : x\u271d\nf : \u211d \u2192 \u211d\nx1 x2 : \u211d\nh : x1 < x2\nhf : \u2200 x \u2208 ?m.1606 f x1 x2 h x, HasDerivAt f 0 x\n\u22a2 f x1 = f x2\nPlease revise the proof.",

We can find this by integrating each term:\n- For x\u00b2, the antiderivative is (x\u00b3/3)\n- For 2ix, the antiderivative is ix\u00b2\n- For -3, the antiderivative is -3x\n\nSo F(x) = (x\u00b3/3) + ix\u00b2 - 3x\n\nNow, according to the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus for Complex Integrals, we can find the definite integral by evaluating F(b) - F(a), where a = -1 and b = 1.\n\nLet's evaluate F(1) and F(-1):\n\nF(1) = (1/3) + i(1) - 3\nF(-1) = (-1/3) + i(1) - (-3)\n\nTherefore, the integral equals F(1) - F(-1):\n= [(1/3) + i - 3] - [(-1/3) + i + 3]\n= [1/3 + i - 3] - [-1/3 + i + 3]\n= (1/3 + i - 3) + (1/3 - i - 3)\n= 2/3 - 6\n\nThis result is a real number: -16/3 (or approximately -5.33)\n\nThe fact that we got a real number despite integrating a complex function makes sense because:\n1. The x\u00b2 and -3 terms contribute only to the real part\n2. The 2ix term, when integrated over a symmetric interval [-1,1], has its imaginary contributions cancel out due to symmetry around zero\n\nTherefore, the integral \u222bf(x)dx from -1 to 1 equals -16/3, which is a real number.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'I'\nfailed to synthesize\n  HMul \u2102 (Sort (max 1 ?u.548)) ?m.3997\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  HSub \u2115 \u2102 (Sort ?u.548)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\ncannot evaluate code because 'eval_F' uses 'sorry' and/or contains errors\ncannot evaluate code because 'eval_F' uses 'sorry' and/or contains errors\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'I'\nfailed to synthesize\n  HMul \u2102 (Sort (max 1 ?u.548)) ?m.3997\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  HSub \u2115 \u2102 (Sort ?u.548)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\ncannot evaluate code because 'eval_F' uses 'sorry' and/or contains errors\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'I'\nunknown identifier 'I'\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Complex.instField', and it does not have executable code\ntype mismatch\n  Float.val 1.\nhas type\n  floatSpec.float : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  Set \u2102 : Type\nunknown identifier 'I'\nno goals to be solved\nunknown identifier 'I'\ntype mismatch\n  Float.val 1.\nhas type\n  floatSpec.float : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  Set \u2102 : Type\nunknown identifier 'integral_eq_sub_of_hasDerivAt'\nunknown identifier 'h3'\nPlease revise the proof.",

The total structure includes both the garden and the path\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\nThe original garden area is straightforward - it's just length times width: 6 \u00d7 4 = 24 square meters.\n\nFor the total structure, we need to consider that the path adds 1 meter to each side:\n- The total length becomes 6 + 2 = 8 meters (adding 1m to each end)\n- The total width becomes 4 + 2 = 6 meters (adding 1m to each side)\n- So the total area is 8 \u00d7 6 = 48 square meters\n\nNow, to find what fraction the garden occupies:\n- Garden area = 24 square meters\n- Total area = 48 square meters\n- Fraction = 24/48 = 1/2 or 0.5 or 50%\n\nThis makes intuitive sense because:\n1. The path's width is substantial (1m) compared to the garden's dimensions\n2. The path needs to go around all four sides\n3. The path creates \"corner squares\" where it overlaps with itself\n4.

Since she saved her entire weekly allowance of $5 each week, we can determine her total savings by multiplying her weekly allowance by the number of weeks. This means she saved $5 \u00d7 12 = $60 in total.\n\nNow, we need to consider what happens when she buys the toy on sale. The original price was $60, but she found it on sale for $40. This means she only needs to spend $40 from her saved amount of $60.\n\nTo find how much money she has left, we can subtract the sale price from her total savings. Since she saved $60 and spent $40, the remaining amount would be $60 - $40 = $20.\n\nThe logic here is straightforward: the total amount saved minus the amount spent equals the amount remaining. This follows from the basic principle of subtraction representing the difference between two quantities.\n\nTherefore, Alice has $20 left after buying the toy on sale. This makes sense because she saved enough for the original price ($60) but only needed to spend two-thirds of her savings ($40) due to finding the toy on sale, leaving her with one-third ($20) of her original savings.\n\nThis solution is complete because we've accounted for all the money coming in (savings over 12 weeks) and going out (purchase of the toy), and calculated the difference to find the remaining amount.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'let'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'let'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'let'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "# Informal Proof:\n\nLet me explain why the median for an even number of values is the average of the middle two numbers when arranged in ascending order.\n\nFirst, let's understand what we're trying to prove. When we have an even number n of values, there isn't a single middle value like we have with odd numbers. Instead, we have two middle values - one at position n/2 and another at position (n/2)+1 after arranging the numbers in ascending order.\n\nHere's why taking the average of these two middle numbers makes sense as the median:\n\n1. When we arrange the numbers in ascending order, we create a sequence where each number is greater than or equal to all numbers before it.\n\n2. With n numbers (where n is even), we can split the ordered sequence into two equal halves:\n   - The first n/2 numbers form the lower half\n   - The last n/2 numbers form the upper half\n\n3. The key property of a median is that it should divide the data into two equal parts, where:\n   - Half of the values are less than or equal to the median\n   - Half of the values are greater than or equal to the median\n\n4. The number at position n/2 is the largest number in the lower half, while the number at position (n/2)+1 is the smallest number in the upper half.\n\n5. By taking the average of these two numbers, we create a value that:\n   - Is greater than or equal to all numbers in the lower half (because it's at least as large as the n/2th number)\n   - Is less than or equal to all numbers in the upper half (because it's at most as large as the (n/2+1)th number)\n   - Perfectly balances between the two halves, satisfying the median property\n\nTherefore, the average of the (n/2)th and ((n/2)+1)th numbers serves as the appropriate median value, as it creates the necessary equal division of the data set while maintaining the ordering properties required of a median.\n\nThis approach ensures that exactly half of the values lie below (or equal to) the median and half lie above (or equal to) it, which is the fundamental requirement for a median.\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  Nat.div_lt_self (zero_lt_succ n)\nargument\n  zero_lt_succ n\nhas type\n  0 < n.succ : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  0 < n : Prop\napplication type mismatch\n  \u27e8n / 2 + 1, \u22ef\u27e9\nargument\n  succ_lt_succ (Nat.div_lt_self (zero_lt_succ n) ?m.843)\nhas type\n  (n.succ / ?m.842).succ < n.succ.succ : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  n / 2 + 1 < n : Prop\nfunction expected at\n  Sorted\nterm has type\n  ?m.99\nfunction expected at\n  median\nterm has type\n  ?m.178\nexpected type must not contain free or meta variables\n  1 < ?m.842\nunknown identifier 'begin'\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: invalid field 'sort', the environment does not contain 'List.sort'\n  l\nhas type\n  List \u2115\nfailed to synthesize\n  HDiv (Option (?m.1462 h h1 h2)) \u2115 (Option \u2115)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\ninvalid field notation, type is not of the form (C ...) where C is a constant\n  sorted\nhas type\n  ?m.9\ninvalid field notation, type is not of the form (C ...) where C is a constant\n  sorted\nhas type\n  ?m.9\ninvalid field notation, type is not of the form (C ...) where C is a constant\n  sorted\nhas type\n  ?m.9\ncannot evaluate code because 'sorryAx' uses 'sorry' and/or contains errors\ncannot evaluate code because 'sorryAx' uses 'sorry' and/or contains errors\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: invalid field 'sort', the environment does not contain 'List.sort'\n  l\nhas type\n  List \u2115\ninvalid field notation, type is not of the form (C ...) where C is a constant\n  sorted\nhas type\n  ?m.9\ninvalid field notation, type is not of the form (C ...) where C is a constant\n  sorted\nhas type\n  ?m.9\ninvalid field notation, type is not of the form (C ...) where C is a constant\n  sorted\nhas type\n  ?m.9\nunknown constant 'List.sort_eq'\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, equality or iff proof expected\n  ?m.3676\n\u22a2 sorryAx (List \u2115 \u2192 Option \u2115) true [1, 2, 3, 4] = some 2\nunknown constant 'List.sort_eq'\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, equality or iff proof expected\n  ?m.4225\n\u22a2 sorryAx (List \u2115 \u2192 Option \u2115) true [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] = some 3\nPlease revise the proof.",

This type of equation has a general solution that involves exponential functions rather than trigonometric functions, because of the negative sign.\n\nThe general solution to y'' - y = 0 will be a linear combination of e^x and e^(-x), which are the fundamental solutions to this equation. We can verify this because when we take the second derivative of either e^x or e^(-x) and subtract the original function, we get zero.\n\nFor the coordinate system transformation, we need to consider how the solution would look when expressed in terms of the given basis vectors v1 = (1,0) and v2 = (0,1). Since these vectors are actually the standard basis vectors, our solution will maintain the same form - we don't need to transform the coordinates.\n\nTo find the particular solution satisfying our initial conditions:\n1. We start with the general solution y = C\u2081e^x + C\u2082e^(-x)\n2. The derivative is y' = C\u2081e^x - C\u2082e^(-x)\n3. At x = 0, y(0) = 1 gives us: C\u2081 + C\u2082 = 1\n4. At x = 0, y'(0) = 0 gives us: C\u2081 - C\u2082 = 0\n\nFrom these conditions, we can deduce that C\u2081 = C\u2082 = 1/2, because:\n- If C\u2081 - C\u2082 = 0, then C\u2081 = C\u2082\n- If C\u2081 + C\u2082 = 1 and C\u2081 = C\u2082, then 2C\u2081 = 1, so C\u2081 = C\u2082 = 1/2\n\nTherefore, the solution in our coordinate system is y = (1/2)e^x + (1/2)e^(-x), which can also be written as y = cosh(x), where cosh is the hyperbolic cosine function.\n\nThis solution satisfies both the differential equation and the initial conditions, and since we're using the standard basis vectors as our new coordinate system, no further transformation is needed.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.cosh', and it does not have executable code\ninvalid field 'deriv', the environment does not contain 'Real.deriv'\n  solution x\nhas type\n  \u211d\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\ninvalid field 'deriv', the environment does not contain 'Real.deriv'\n  solution 0\nhas type\n  \u211d\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: 'deriv' has already been declared\nambiguous, possible interpretations \n  _root_.cosh x : \u211d\n  \n  x.cosh : \u211d\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\n'deriv' has already been declared\nambiguous, possible interpretations \n  _root_.cosh x : \u211d\n  \n  x.cosh : \u211d\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",
