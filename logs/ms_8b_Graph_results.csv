Prove that the average of the lowest score and the highest score is less than or equal to the average score of the class.",0,1,39252,"# Informal Proof:\n\nTo prove that the average of the lowest score and the highest score is less than or equal to the average score of the class, we can use a similar approach to the given theorem. \n\nLet's denote the lowest score as $x$ and the highest score as $y$. We know that $x < y$ since the lowest score is always less than the highest score.\n\nWe want to show that the average of $x$ and $y$ is less than or equal to the average score of the class. Let's denote the average score of the class as $A$. We can express $A$ as the sum of all scores divided by the total number of students, which is 30 in this case.\n\nSince $x$ is the lowest score, we can say that $x \leq A$. Similarly, since $y$ is the highest score, we can say that $A \leq y$.\n\nNow, let's consider the average of $x$ and $y$, which is $\frac{x + y}{2}$. We can see that this average is between $x$ and $y$, since $x < \frac{x + y}{2} < y$.\n\nTo show that $\frac{x + y}{2} \leq A$, we can use the fact that $x \leq A$ and $A \leq y$. Adding these two inequalities, we get $x + A \leq A + y$. Dividing both sides by 2, we get $\frac{x + A}{2} \leq \frac{A + y}{2}$.\n\nSince $x \leq A$, we can say that $\frac{x + A}{2} \leq \frac{A + A}{2} = A$. Similarly, since $A \leq y$, we can say that $\frac{A + y}{2} \leq \frac{A + y}{2}$. \n\nTherefore, we have shown that $\frac{x + A}{2} \leq A \leq \frac{A + y}{2}$, which implies that $\frac{x + y}{2} \leq A$. This means that the average of the lowest score and the highest score is less than or equal to the average score of the class.\n\nNote that this proof is similar to the given theorem, where we used the fact that $x < y$ to show that $x < \frac{x + y}{2} < y$. In this case, we used the fact that $x \leq A$ and $A \leq y$ to show that $\frac{x + y}{2} \leq A$.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\ntheorem average_lowest_highest_score_le_average_class_score :\n  ∀ (s : List Nat), s.length = 30 → s.min = 45 → s.max = 100 →\n  (s.min + s.max) / 2 ≤ (s.sum : ℚ) / 30 := by\n  intro s h_length h_min h_max\n  have h_sum : (s.sum : ℚ) = (s.sum : ℕ) := by norm_cast\n  rw [h_sum]\n  have h_min_le_avg : (s.min : ℚ) ≤ (s.sum : ℚ) / 30 := by\n    rw [h_min]\n    norm_cast\n    exact div_le_div_of_le_of_nonneg (by linarith) (by norm_num)\n  have h_max_le_avg : (s.max : ℚ) ≤ (s.sum : ℚ) / 30 := by\n    rw [h_max]\n    norm_cast\n    exact div_le_div_of_le_of_nonneg (by linarith) (by norm_num)\n  have h_avg : (s.min + s.max : ℚ) / 2 ≤ (s.sum : ℚ) / 30 := by\n    linarith\n  exact h_avg\n```",False

We know that there are 30 students in the class, and their math scores range from 45 to 100.\n\nLet's denote the lowest score as $x$ and the highest score as $y$. We want to show that the average of $x$ and $y$ is less than or equal to the average score of the class.\n\nThe average score of the class can be calculated by summing up all the scores and dividing by the total number of students. Let's denote the average score of the class as $A$. Then, we have:\n\n$$A = \frac{x_1 + x_2 + \ldots + x_{30}}{30}$$\n\nwhere $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_{30}$ are the scores of the 30 students.\n\nSince the scores range from 45 to 100, we know that $x \leq x_i \leq y$ for all $i$. This means that the sum of the scores is at least $30x$ and at most $30y$.\n\nTherefore, we can write:\n\n$$30x \leq x_1 + x_2 + \ldots + x_{30} \leq 30y$$\n\nDividing all three parts of the inequality by 30, we get:\n\n$$x \leq \frac{x_1 + x_2 + \ldots + x_{30}}{30} \leq y$$\n\nThis shows that the average score of the class, $A$, is between the lowest score, $x$, and the highest score, $y$.\n\nNow, we can use the theorem that states that the mean of two unequal real numbers is between them. This theorem states that if $x < y$, then $x < \frac{x+y}{2} < y$.\n\nApplying this theorem to our situation, we get:\n\n$$x < \frac{x+y}{2} < y$$\n\nSince we know that $x \leq A \leq y$, we can conclude that:\n\n$$x < \frac{x+y}{2} \leq A < y$$\n\nThis shows that the average of the lowest score and the highest score, $\frac{x+y}{2}$, is less than or equal to the average score of the class, $A$.\n\nTherefore, we have proved that the average of the lowest score and the highest score is less than or equal to the average score of the class.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\ntheorem average_of_lowest_and_highest_scores_le_average_of_class :\n  ∀ (scores : List Nat) (h : scores.length = 30) (h_range : ∀ s ∈ scores, 45 ≤ s ∧ s ≤ 100),\n    let sum := scores.sum\n    let avg_class := sum / 30\n    let min_score := scores.minimum.get (by simp [h])\n    let max_score := scores.maximum.get (by simp [h])\n    (min_score + max_score) / 2 ≤ avg_class := by\n  intro scores h h_range\n  let sum := scores.sum\n  let avg_class := sum / 30\n  let min_score := scores.minimum.get (by simp [h])\n  let max_score := scores.maximum.get (by simp [h])\n  have h_min : min_score ≤ avg_class := by\n    apply Nat.le_of_lt\n    apply Nat.lt_of_le_of_lt (List.minimum_le_of_mem (List.minimum_mem scores))\n    apply Nat.lt_of_le_of_lt (List.le_sum_of_forall_le scores (fun s hs => (h_range s hs).1))\n    rw [Nat.div_lt_iff_lt_mul (by norm_num : 0 < 30)]\n    linarith\n  have h_max : avg_class ≤ max_score := by\n    apply Nat.le_of_lt\n    apply Nat.lt_of_le_of_lt (List.le_maximum_of_mem (List.maximum_mem scores))\n    apply Nat.lt_of_le_of_lt (List.le_sum_of_forall_le scores (fun s hs => (h_range s hs).2))\n    rw [Nat.div_lt_iff_lt_mul (by norm_num : 0 < 30)]\n    linarith\n  apply Nat.le_trans\n  apply Nat.le_of_eq\n  rw [Nat.add_comm]\n  apply Nat.div_le_div_right\n  apply Nat.add_le_add h_min h_max\n```",False

We are given that $L \leq H$. We want to prove that the average of $L$ and $H$ is less than or equal to the average score of the class.\n\nFirst, let's consider the average score of the class. Since there are 30 students, the average score is the sum of all scores divided by 30. Let's denote the sum of all scores as $S$.

Let's denote the sum of the remaining scores as $R$. Then, we have:\n\n$S = L + H + R$\n\nSince $L \leq H$, we know that $L + H \leq 2H$.

We can write:\n\n$\frac{L + H}{2} \leq \frac{2H + R}{2}$\n\nSince $R$ is the sum of the remaining scores, we know that $R \geq 0$. Therefore, we can write:\n\n$\frac{2H + R}{2} \leq \frac{2H + 0}{2} = H$\n\nNow, we can see that:\n\n$\frac{L + H}{2} \leq H$\n\nThis is because $H$ is the highest score, and the average of $L$ and $H$ is less than or equal to $H$.\n\nFinally, we can use the fact that the average score of the class is greater than or equal to the highest score $H$.

Prove that P(x) is the zero polynomial.,1,1,"51833,4581","# Informal Proof:\n\nLet's consider a polynomial $P(x)$ of degree $n$ with $n+1$ distinct roots. By definition, a root of a polynomial is a value of $x$ that makes the polynomial equal to zero. Since $P(x)$ has $n+1$ distinct roots, we can denote these roots as $r_1, r_2, \ldots, r_{n+1}$.\n\nWe know that if a polynomial has a root, then it can be factored as $(x - r_1)$. If it has two roots, it can be factored as $(x - r_1)(x - r_2)$. Extending this pattern, if it has $n+1$ roots, it can be factored as $(x - r_1)(x - r_2) \cdots (x - r_{n+1})$.\n\nHowever, since the degree of $P(x)$ is $n$, the number of roots it can have is at most $n$. This is a fundamental property of polynomials, and it's a direct consequence of the way we define the degree of a polynomial.\n\nNow, let's examine the product $(x - r_1)(x - r_2) \cdots (x - r_{n+1})$. When we multiply this out, we get a polynomial of degree $n+1$. But we know that the degree of $P(x)$ is $n$, so this product cannot be equal to $P(x)$.\n\nThe only way for this product to be equal to the zero polynomial is if all the terms cancel out. This can only happen if the roots $r_1, r_2, \ldots, r_{n+1}$ are all equal to each other. But this is impossible, since we assumed that the roots are distinct.\n\nTherefore, we have reached a contradiction. The only way to resolve this contradiction is to conclude that the product $(x - r_1)(x - r_2) \cdots (x - r_{n+1})$ is actually equal to the zero polynomial.\n\nThis means that $P(x)$ must be the zero polynomial, since it has $n+1$ distinct roots. This is a fundamental property of polynomials, and it's a direct consequence of the way we define the degree of a polynomial.\n\nIn conclusion, we have shown that if a polynomial $P(x)$ of degree $n$ has $n+1$ distinct roots, then it must be the zero polynomial.

We are given that the car travels 60 miles in 1 hour, which means its speed is 60 miles per hour.\n\nHowever, the problem we are given is not directly related to this information. Instead, it involves a train traveling from Anglechester to Clinkerton, with some unknown distance $d$ and speed $v$. The train malfunctions after traveling a certain distance $d_1$, and we are given two scenarios: one where the train continues 2 hours late, and another where it arrives 40 minutes sooner.\n\nWe can start by analyzing the given equations. Equation (2) represents the time it takes for the train to travel from the malfunction point to Clinkerton, 2 hours late. This equation involves the distance $d_1$ and the speed $v$, as well as the time $t$ it would normally take to travel the journey.\n\nEquation (3) represents the time it takes for the train to travel from the malfunction point to Clinkerton, 40 minutes sooner. This equation also involves the distance $d_1$ and the speed $v$, as well as the time $t$ it would normally take to travel the journey.\n\nBy subtracting equation (5) from equation (4), we can eliminate the distance $d_1$ and obtain an equation involving only the speed $v$ and the time $t$. This equation is given by equation (6), which states that $100 = 2v$.\n\nWe can then substitute this value of $v$ into equation (5) to obtain an equation involving only the distance $d_1$ and the time $t$. This equation is given by equation (7), which states that $5d - 2d_1 = 150t + 300$.\n\nBy substituting the value of $d_1 = v$ into equation (8), we can eliminate the distance $d_1$ and obtain an equation involving only the distance $d$ and the time $t$. This equation is given by equation (9), which states that $2d - 100 = 300$.\n\nFinally, we can solve for the distance $d$ by adding 100 to both sides of the equation, which gives us $d = 200$.\n\nHowever, this solution does not directly answer the question of how far the car will travel in 5 hours. To solve this problem, we need to use the information given at the beginning of the problem, which states that the car travels 60 miles in 1 hour.\n\nSince the car travels 60 miles in 1 hour, we can multiply this distance by the number of hours it will travel to find the total distance traveled. In this case, the car will travel for 5 hours, so the total distance traveled will be $60 \times 5 = 300$ miles.\n\nTherefore, the car will travel 300 miles in 5 hours.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\n-- If a car travels 60 miles in 1 hour, how far will it travel in 5 hours?\ntheorem car_travel_distance : 60 * 5 = 300 := by\n  -- The car travels 60 miles in 1 hour, so in 5 hours, it will travel 60 * 5 miles.\n  norm_num\n```",True

Since f(x) = x^2, we can substitute this into the equation for g(x) to get g(x) = x^2 + r^2.\n\nTo find the intersection points of the graph of g(x) and the circle, we need to set g(x) equal to the equation of the circle: x^2 + r^2 = r^2 - x^2.\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get 2x^2 = 0, which implies x = 0. This means that the graph of g(x) intersects the circle at the point (0, r^2).\n\nHowever, we need to show that there is exactly one more intersection point. To do this, we can consider the equation g(x) = r^2 - x^2. Rearranging this equation, we get x^2 + (r^2 - x^2) = r^2, which is similar to the equation we obtained in the context of implicit functions.\n\nUsing the same reasoning as before, we can conclude that the graph of g(x) intersects the circle at exactly two points: (0, r^2) and the point where x^2 = r^2 - x^2.\n\nTo find the x-coordinate of the second intersection point, we can solve the equation x^2 = r^2 - x^2. This gives us x^2 = r^2/2, which implies x = ±√(r^2/2).\n\nSince r > 0, we know that √(r^2/2) is a real number. Therefore, the graph of g(x) intersects the circle at exactly two points: (0, r^2) and (√(r^2/2), r^2 - (√(r^2/2))^2) and (-√(r^2/2), r^2 - (-√(r^2/2))^2).\n\nThis completes the proof that the graph of g(x) intersects the circle at exactly two points for all r > 0.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\n-- Define the function f(x) = x^2\ndef f (x : ℝ) : ℝ := x^2\n\n-- Define the function g(x) = f(x) + r^2\ndef g (r x : ℝ) : ℝ := f x + r^2\n\n-- Define the circle equation x^2 + y^2 = r^2\ndef circle (r x y : ℝ) : Prop := x^2 + y^2 = r^2\n\n-- Theorem: The graph of g(x) intersects the circle at exactly two points for all r > 0\ntheorem intersects_circle_at_two_points (r : ℝ) (hr : r > 0) :\n  ∃ x1 x2 : ℝ, x1 ≠ x2 ∧ circle r x1 (g r x1) ∧ circle r x2 (g r x2) := by\n  -- Let x1 be the intersection point (0, r^2)\n  let x1 := 0\n  -- Let x2 be the intersection point (√(r^2/2), r^2 - (√(r^2/2))^2)\n  let x2 := Real.sqrt (r^2 / 2)\n  -- Show that x1 and x2 are distinct\n  have h_distinct : x1 ≠ x2 := by\n    intro h\n    rw [h] at x2\n    have : Real.sqrt (r^2 / 2) = 0 := by linarith\n    have : r^2 / 2 = 0 := Real.sqrt_eq_zero.mp this\n    linarith\n  -- Show that the circle equation holds for x1\n  have h_circle_x1 : circle r x1 (g r x1) := by\n    simp [circle, g, f, x1]\n    ring\n  -- Show that the circle equation holds for x2\n  have h_circle_x2 : circle r x2 (g r x2) := by\n    simp [circle, g, f, x2]\n    ring\n  -- Conclude the existence of the two intersection points\n  use x1, x2\n  exact ⟨h_distinct, h_circle_x1, h_circle_x2⟩\n```",False

We substitute $x=1$ and $y=2$ into the function:\n\n$f(1,2) = (1)^2(2) - 3(1)(2)^2 + 5 = 2 - 12 + 5 = -5$\n\nNow, we need to find the distance between $f(x,y)$ and $f(1,2)$. We can use the usual metric on the real numbers, which is the absolute value of the difference between the two numbers. So, we need to show that:\n\n$|f(x,y) - f(1,2)| = |x^2y - 3xy^2 + 5 - (-5)| = |x^2y - 3xy^2 + 10| < \epsilon$\n\nWe can simplify this expression by factoring out $x$ and $y$:\n\n$|x^2y - 3xy^2 + 10| = |x(y^2 - 3y) + 10|$\n\nNow, we can use the triangle inequality to bound this expression:\n\n$|x(y^2 - 3y) + 10| \leq |x(y^2 - 3y)| + |10|$\n\nWe can further bound this expression by using the fact that $|x| \leq \max\{|x-1|, 1\}$ and $|y| \leq \max\{|y-2|, 2\}$:\n\n$|x(y^2 - 3y)| \leq \max\{|x-1|, 1\} \max\{|y-2|, 2\}^2 \max\{|y-2|, 2\}$\n\nNow, we can choose $\delta$ to be the minimum of the values that make the right-hand side of this inequality less than $\epsilon/2$. This will ensure that if the distance between $(x,y)$ and $(1,2)$ is less than $\delta$, then the distance between $f(x,y)$ and $f(1,2)$ is less than $\epsilon$.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that for any given positive real number $\epsilon$, there exists a positive real number $\delta$ such that for any point $(x,y)$ in the real number plane, if the distance between $(x,y)$ and $(1,2)$ is less than $\delta$, then the distance between $f(x,y)$ and $f(1,2)$ is less than $\epsilon$.

In this case, the CDF can be expressed as:\n\nF(x) = 1 - (1-p)^x\n\n## Step 6: Find the derivative of f(x)\nTo find the derivative of f(x), we can use the chain rule and the fact that the derivative of (1-p)^x is -(1-p)^x \* ln(1-p).\n\n## Step 7: Evaluate the derivative at x = 3\nTo find the derivative of f(x) when x = 3, we can substitute x = 3 into the derivative expression.\n\n## Step 8: Simplify the derivative expression\nSince the derivative of f(x) is a constant, we can simplify the expression by evaluating the derivative at x = 3.\n\n## Step 9: Find the value of the constant\nTo find the value of the constant, we can substitute x = 3 into the simplified derivative expression.\n\n## Step 10: Calculate the final answer\nThe final answer is the value of the constant.\n\n# Informal Proof:\nThe derivative of f(x) when x equals to 3 is:\n\nf'(3) = -(1-0.8)^3 \* ln(1-0.8)\n= -0.2^3 \* ln(0.2)\n= -0.008 \* (-1.609)\n= 0.0129\n\nSince the derivative of f(x) is a constant, the value of this constant is 0.0129.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\n-- Define the probability function f(x)\ndef f (x : ℝ) : ℝ := 1 - (1 - 0.8) ^ x\n\n-- Calculate the derivative of f(x)\ndef f' (x : ℝ) : ℝ := -(1 - 0.8) ^ x * Real.log (1 - 0.8)\n\n-- Evaluate the derivative at x = 3\nexample : f' 3 = 0.0129 :=\nbegin\n  -- Simplify the expression\n  have h : (1 - 0.8) = 0.2 := by norm_num,\n  rw h,\n  -- Calculate the value\n  have h2 : Real.log 0.2 = -1.6094379124341003 := by norm_num,\n  rw h2,\n  -- Final calculation\n  norm_num,\nend\n```",False

correct_by_msg__HIGH_theorem_proving_Precalculus_296_round2,Prove that the sum of all numbers from 1 to 100 is 5050.,0,1,29878,"# Informal Proof:\n\nTo prove that the sum of all numbers from 1 to 100 is 5050, we can utilize a similar approach to the one used in the given proof. The key insight is to recognize that the sum of numbers from 1 to 100 is equivalent to the sum of numbers from 1 to 99 plus the number 100.\n\nWe can start by considering the sum of numbers from 1 to 99, which is essentially the sum of numbers from 1 to 100 minus the number 100. This allows us to rewrite the sum as:\n\n1 + 2 + ... + 99 + 100 - 100\n\nNow, we can rearrange the terms to group the numbers from 1 to 99 together, and then add 100 to the end:\n\n1 + 2 + ... + 99 + 100\n\nNotice that this is the same as the original sum of numbers from 1 to 100. However, we can now apply a similar technique to the one used in the given proof. We can pair each number from 1 to 99 with its corresponding number from 99 to 1, effectively creating a series of pairs that sum to 100.\n\nFor example, the pair (1, 99) sums to 100, the pair (2, 98) sums to 100, and so on. This allows us to rewrite the sum as:\n\n(1 + 99) + (2 + 98) + ... + (49 + 51) + 50\n\nNow, we can simplify each pair to 100, and then multiply the result by 50 (since there are 50 pairs):\n\n50 * 100\n\nHowever, we can simplify this further by recognizing that 50 * 100 is equivalent to 50 * (100 - 50), which is:\n\n50 * 50 * 2\n\nThis is equivalent to (50 * 50) * 2, which is:\n\n2500 * 2\n\nNow, we can simplify this to:\n\n5000\n\nHowever, we are not quite done yet. We need to add the number 50 to the result, since we initially paired 50 with itself. This gives us a final result of:\n\n5000 + 50\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n5050\n\nTherefore, we have shown that the sum of all numbers from 1 to 100 is indeed 5050.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\ntheorem sum_of_numbers_from_1_to_100 : ∑ i in Finset.range 101, i = 5050 := by\n  simp_all [Finset.sum_range_succ, Finset.sum_range_one]\n  <;> norm_num\n  <;> linarith\n```",True

This means that 1 is the first ordinal in the sequence of ordinals.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement x * 1 = x, where x is an arbitrary ordinal. We can start by using the definition of ordinal multiplication, which states that for any ordinals a and b, a * b is the ordinal that results from adding a to itself b times.\n\nUsing this definition, we can rewrite x * 1 as x * (the ordinal one). Since the ordinal one is the smallest ordinal that is not equal to the empty set, we can think of it as the ""unit"" ordinal that doesn't change the value of x when multiplied by it.\n\nWhen we multiply x by the ordinal one, we are essentially adding x to itself once, which results in x itself. This is because the ordinal one is the smallest ordinal that doesn't change the value of x when added to it.\n\nTo make this more formal, we can use the definition of ordinal addition, which states that for any ordinals a and b, a + b is the ordinal that results from concatenating a and b.\n\nUsing this definition, we can rewrite x * 1 as x + (the ordinal one).

The area of each triangle is given by (r * b_i) / 2, and the total area of the circle is the sum of these areas.\n\nWe can rewrite the formula for the area of the circle as A(r) = (r / 2) * (b_1 + b_2 + b_3 + ...), where b_1 + b_2 + b_3 + ... is the length of the circumference of the circle.\n\nFrom the context, we also know that b_1 + b_2 + b_3 + ... = 2πr, which is the formula for the circumference of a circle.\n\nNow, let's consider the rate of change of the area with respect to the radius, which is given by dA/dr. We can find this by taking the derivative of the area formula with respect to r.\n\nUsing the product rule of differentiation, we can rewrite dA/dr as (d/dr)(r / 2) * (b_1 + b_2 + b_3 + ...) + (r / 2) * (d/dr)(b_1 + b_2 + b_3 + ...).\n\nSince the derivative of a constant is zero, the first term vanishes, and we are left with (r / 2) * (d/dr)(b_1 + b_2 + b_3 + ...).\n\nNow, let's consider the derivative of the circumference with respect to the radius, which is given by d/dr(b_1 + b_2 + b_3 + ...). We can find this by taking the derivative of the circumference formula with respect to r.\n\nUsing the chain rule of differentiation, we can rewrite d/dr(b_1 + b_2 + b_3 + ...) as d/dr(2πr), which is equal to 2π.\n\nSubstituting this back into the expression for dA/dr, we get (r / 2) * 2π, which simplifies to πr.\n\nThis shows that the rate of change of the area with respect to the radius is proportional to the circumference of the circle, as required.\n\nNote that this proof is based on the intuitive and non-rigorous proof provided in the context, and it assumes that the area of a circle can be approximated as the sum of the areas of many small sectors.

In other words, it's a line that best approximates the relationship between the x and y variables.\n\nFor the first data set, {(2,3), (4,7), (6,11)}, we can calculate the slope of the line of best fit using the formula: slope = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1). Let's calculate the slope using the first two points: (2,3) and (4,7). The slope is (7 - 3) / (4 - 2) = 4 / 2 = 2.\n\nNow, let's calculate the slope using the last two points: (4,7) and (6,11).

In a horizontal line, the y-coordinates of all points are equal, and the slope is 0. However, in this case, the points do not lie on a horizontal line, but rather on a line with a slope of 2.

In the context of linear regression, the line of best fit is given by the equation y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept.\n\nThe slope of a line is a measure of how steep it is and can be calculated using the formula m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1), where (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are two points on the line.\n\nGiven the two data sets, we can calculate the slope of the line of best fit for each set. For the first set, the points are (2, 3), (4, 7), and (6, 11). We can calculate the slope using the formula above:\n\nm1 = (7 - 3) / (4 - 2) = 4 / 2 = 2\n\nFor the second set, the points are (1, 2), (2, 4), and (3, 6). We can calculate the slope using the same formula:\n\nm2 = (4 - 2) / (2 - 1) = 2 / 1 = 2\n\nNotice that the slopes of the lines of best fit for both data sets are equal, which is m1 = m2 = 2.\n\nHowever, we need to prove that this is indeed the case. To do this, we can use the concept of equivalence relations. An equivalence relation is a binary relation that is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.\n\nIn this case, we can define a relation R between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) if the slope of the line passing through these points is the same. We can then show that this relation satisfies the properties of an equivalence relation.\n\nFirst, we need to show that the relation is reflexive, meaning that (x, y) R (x, y) for all points (x, y). This is true because the slope of the line passing through a point with itself is zero, which is equal to itself.\n\nNext, we need to show that the relation is symmetric, meaning that if (x1, y1) R (x2, y2), then (x2, y2) R (x1, y1). This is true because the slope of the line passing through two points is the same in both directions.\n\nFinally, we need to show that the relation is transitive, meaning that if (x1, y1) R (x2, y2) and (x2, y2) R (x3, y3), then (x1, y1) R (x3, y3). This is true because the slope of the line passing through three points is the same if the slope of the line passing through the first two points is the same and the slope of the line passing through the last two points is the same.\n\nOnce we have shown that the relation is an equivalence relation, we can conclude that the slopes of the lines of best fit for both data sets are equal, which is m1 = m2 = 2.\n\nThis proof relies on the concept of equivalence relations, which is a fundamental concept in mathematics. It also relies on the definition of a line of best fit and the concept of slope, which are both important concepts in linear regression.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\n-- Define the data sets\ndef dataSet1 : List (Nat × Nat) := [(2, 3), (4, 7), (6, 11)]\ndef dataSet2 : List (Nat × Nat) := [(1, 2), (2, 4), (3, 6)]\n\n-- Define a function to calculate the slope of the line of best fit\ndef slope (points : List (Nat × Nat)) : Float :=\n  let n := points.length\n  if n < 2 then 0\n  else\n    let sumX := points.foldl (fun acc (x, _) => acc + x) 0\n    let sumY := points.foldl (fun acc (_, y) => acc + y) 0\n    let sumXY := points.foldl (fun acc (x, y) => acc + x * y) 0\n    let sumX2 := points.foldl (fun acc (x, _) => acc + x * x) 0\n    let meanX := sumX.toFloat / n.toFloat\n    let meanY := sumY.toFloat / n.toFloat\n    (sumXY.toFloat - n.toFloat * meanX * meanY) / (sumX2.toFloat - n.toFloat * meanX * meanX)\n\n-- Calculate the slopes for both data sets\ndef slope1 := slope dataSet1\ndef slope2 := slope dataSet2\n\n-- Prove that the slopes are equal\ntheorem slopes_equal : slope1 = slope2 := by\n  -- Calculate the slopes\n  let m1 := slope dataSet1\n  let m2 := slope dataSet2\n  -- Compare the slopes\n  simp [slope, dataSet1, dataSet2]\n  -- Simplify the expressions\n  rfl\n```",False

This implies that the equation has a repeated root, since both factors are equal to zero.\n\nTo further confirm this, we can use the fact that the quadratic equation (a^2)x^2 - 2abx + b^2 = 0 can be written as (a^2)x^2 - 2abx + b^2 = (ax - b)^2 = 0. This means that the equation has a repeated root, since the square of a number is always non-negative.\n\nWe can also use the fact that the discriminant of the quadratic equation (a^2)x^2 - 2abx + b^2 = 0 is equal to zero. The discriminant is given by the formula b^2 - 4ac, where a, b, and c are the coefficients of the quadratic equation. In this case, the discriminant is b^2 - 4(a^2)(-b) = b^2 + 4ab^2 = 4b^2(a + b), which is equal to zero.\n\nThis implies that the quadratic equation (a^2)x^2 - 2abx + b^2 = 0 has a repeated root, since the discriminant is equal to zero.\n\nWe can also use the fact that the quadratic equation (a^2)x^2 - 2abx + b^2 = 0 can be written as (ax - b)^2 = 0. This means that the equation has a repeated root, since the square of a number is always non-negative.\n\nIn conclusion, we have shown that the quadratic equation (a^2)x^2 - 2abx + b^2 = 0 has a repeated root, using the fact that the equation is a perfect square, the discriminant is equal to zero, and the equation can be written as (ax - b)^2 = 0.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\ntheorem quadratic_equation_repeated_root (a b : ℝ) : \n  let discriminant := b^2 - 4 * a^2 * b^2;\n  discriminant = 0 → ∃ x, (a^2) * x^2 - 2 * a * b * x + b^2 = 0 ∧ ∀ y, (a^2) * y^2 - 2 * a * b * y + b^2 = 0 → y = x := by\n  intro discriminant h_discriminant\n  use b / a\n  constructor\n  field_simp [h_discriminant]\n  ring\n  intro y hy\n  field_simp [h_discriminant] at hy\n  linarith\n```",False

A function $f$ is continuous at a point $x = a$ if and only if for every $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a $\delta > 0$ such that for all $x$, if $|x - a| < \delta$, then $|f(x) - f(a)| < \epsilon$.\n\nHowever, in this case, we can use a more intuitive approach by leveraging the fact that $f(x) = x^2$ is a polynomial function, and polynomial functions are continuous everywhere. This is because polynomial functions can be expressed as a finite sum of terms of the form $ax^n$, where $a$ and $n$ are constants, and the sum of continuous functions is continuous.\n\nIn particular, the function $f(x) = x^2$ can be expressed as $f(x) = x \cdot x$, which is the product of two continuous functions, $x$ and $x$. Since the product of continuous functions is continuous, we can conclude that $f(x) = x^2$ is continuous everywhere.\n\nTo prove that $f(x) = x^2$ is continuous at $x = 2$, we can use the fact that $f(x) = x^2$ is continuous everywhere. This means that for every $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a $\delta > 0$ such that for all $x$, if $|x - a| < \delta$, then $|f(x) - f(a)| < \epsilon$. In this case, we can choose $a = 2$ and $\epsilon > 0$ arbitrarily.\n\nSince $f(x) = x^2$ is continuous everywhere, we know that there exists a $\delta > 0$ such that for all $x$, if $|x - 2| < \delta$, then $|f(x) - f(2)| < \epsilon$. This means that for all $x$, if $|x - 2| < \delta$, then $|x^2 - 2^2| < \epsilon$.\n\nSimplifying the inequality, we get $|x^2 - 4| < \epsilon$. This means that for all $x$, if $|x - 2| < \delta$, then $|x^2 - 4| < \epsilon$.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that for every $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a $\delta > 0$ such that for all $x$, if $|x - 2| < \delta$, then $|f(x) - f(2)| < \epsilon$.

This function is defined for all real numbers, so it is defined at $x = 2$.\n\nNext, we need to show that the limit of the function as $x$ approaches $2$ exists. To do this, we can use the definition of a limit. The limit of a function $f$ as $x$ approaches $a$ is equal to $L$ if for every $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a $\delta > 0$ such that for all $x$, $|x - a| < \delta$ implies $|f(x) - L| < \epsilon$.\n\nIn this case, we want to show that the limit of $f(x) = x^2$ as $x$ approaches $2$ is equal to $f(2) = 4$.

Since $x + 2 > 2$, we have $|x + 2| > 2$, so $|x^2 - 4| < \delta|x + 2| < \delta(2 + \delta)$.

In this case, we want to find the point that divides the line segment between (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) into two equal parts, which is essentially the midpoint.\n\nWe can start by considering the coordinates of the midpoint, which we'll call (X, Y). Since the midpoint divides the line segment into two equal parts, we can set up the following proportion:\n\n(x2 - X) / (X - x1) = 1 / 1\n\nThis proportion states that the ratio of the distance from x2 to the midpoint (X) to the distance from the midpoint (X) to x1 is equal to 1, since they are equal.\n\nSimplifying this proportion, we get:\n\nx2 - X = X - x1\n\nRearranging the terms, we get:\n\n2X = x2 + x1\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\n\nX = (x1 + x2) / 2\n\nThis shows that the x-coordinate of the midpoint is indeed (x1 + x2) / 2.\n\nSimilarly, we can set up a proportion for the y-coordinate:\n\n(y2 - Y) / (Y - y1) = 1 / 1\n\nSimplifying this proportion, we get:\n\ny2 - Y = Y - y1\n\nRearranging the terms, we get:\n\n2Y = y2 + y1\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\n\nY = (y1 + y2) / 2\n\nThis shows that the y-coordinate of the midpoint is indeed (y1 + y2) / 2.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the midpoint of a line segment with endpoints (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is indeed ((x1 + x2) / 2, (y1 + y2) / 2).","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\ntheorem midpoint_of_line_segment (x1 x2 y1 y2 : ℝ) :\n  let X := (x1 + x2) / 2;\n  let Y := (y1 + y2) / 2;\n  (X, Y) = ((x1 + x2) / 2, (y1 + y2) / 2) := by\n  simp\n```",True

Let's denote the shorter side as $x$ and the longer side as $y$. We know that the length of one side is 3 times the length of the other side, so we can write an equation: $y = 3x$.\n\nWe are also given that the perimeter of the rectangle is 32 units. The perimeter of a rectangle is the sum of the lengths of all its sides, which can be expressed as $2x + 2y$. Since we know that $y = 3x$, we can substitute this into the perimeter equation to get $2x + 2(3x) = 32$.\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get $2x + 6x = 32$, which further simplifies to $8x = 32$. Dividing both sides by 8, we find that $x = 4$. Now that we have the value of $x$, we can find the value of $y$ by substituting $x$ into the equation $y = 3x$. This gives us $y = 3(4) = 12$.\n\nTherefore, the length of the shorter side is 4 units, and the length of the longer side is 12 units.\n\nHowever, we need to prove that this solution is correct. To do this, we can use the general solution provided in the context. The general solution states that the sides of the rectangle are given by $x = 2n^3 - 1$, $y = 2n^3$, $u = n(4n^3 - 2)$, and $v = n$.\n\nWe can substitute $n = 3$ into these equations to get the specific solution for this problem.

Using the linearity property of the Laplace Transform, we can write:\n\nL{X(t)} = L{[x1(t), x2(t), ..., xn(t)]}\n\n= [L{x1(t)}, L{x2(t)}, ..., L{xn(t)}]\n\nSince each column of X(t) is a solution to the differential equation dx/dt = Ax, we can apply the Laplace Transform to each column separately. Using the property of the Laplace Transform that L{dx/dt} = sL{x} - x(0), we get:\n\nL{x1(t)} = sL{x1(t)} - x1(0)\nL{x2(t)} = sL{x2(t)} - x2(0)\n...\nL{xn(t)} = sL{xn(t)} - xn(0)\n\nNow, recall that the initial conditions for each column of X(t) are given by xi(0) = ei. Therefore, we can simplify the above equations as:\n\nL{x1(t)} = sL{x1(t)} - e1\nL{x2(t)} = sL{x2(t)} - e2\n...\nL{xn(t)} = sL{xn(t)} - en\n\nRearranging the terms, we get:\n\n(sI - A)L{X(t)} = I\n\nwhere I is the identity matrix.\n\nTo solve for L{X(t)}, we can multiply both sides of the equation by (sI - A)^-1, which is the inverse of (sI - A). This gives us:\n\nL{X(t)} = (sI - A)^-1\n\nTherefore, we have shown that the Laplace Transform of X(t) equals (sI - A)^-1, as required.\n\nNote that this proof relies heavily on the properties of the Laplace Transform, as well as the relationship between the matrix X(t) and the system of linear differential equations dx/dt = Ax.

Let's denote the area of the rectangle $ABCD$ as $\map \Area {ABCD}$.\n\nNow, let's consider the square $AIGE$. We can express its area as the sum of the squares of its side lengths, which is $(a + b)^2$. Expanding this expression, we get $a^2 + 2ab + b^2$.\n\nHowever, we know that the area of the square $AIGE$ is also equal to the sum of the areas of the two smaller squares, $\square ABCD$ and $\square BCHI$. Since $\square ABCD$ has an area of $\map \Area {ABCD}$, we can rewrite the expression as $a^2 + 2\map \Area {ABCD} + b^2$.\n\nEquating these two expressions, we get $a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = a^2 + 2\map \Area {ABCD} + b^2$. Simplifying this equation, we find that $2ab = 2\map \Area {ABCD}$.\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we obtain $ab = \map \Area {ABCD}$. This is the key result that allows us to find the area of the rectangle.\n\nNow, let's substitute the given values for the length and width of the rectangle. We have $a = 8$ and $b = 5$. Plugging these values into the equation, we get $8 \times 5 = \map \Area {ABCD}$.\n\nTherefore, the area of the rectangle is $8 \times 5 = 40$ square units.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\n-- Define the theorem for the area of a rectangle\ntheorem rectangle_area (a b : ℝ) : a * b = 40 :=\nbegin\n  -- Given the length and width of the rectangle\n  let length := 8,\n  let width := 5,\n  -- Calculate the area of the rectangle\n  have h : length * width = 40,\n  {\n    -- Perform the multiplication\n    calc\n      length * width = 8 * 5 : by rw [length, width]\n      ...           = 40     : by norm_num,\n  },\n  -- Conclude the proof\n  exact h,\nend\n```",False

This implies that their corresponding sides are equal in length. Specifically, we know that AB = DE and AC = DF.\n\nNow, let's consider the transformations applied to triangle ABC to transform it into triangle DEF. Since the triangles are congruent, any transformation that preserves the shape and size of triangle ABC will also preserve the equality of its corresponding sides.\n\nOne of the transformations mentioned is rotation. When triangle ABC is rotated, its sides will change direction, but their lengths will remain the same. This is because rotation is an isometry, which means it preserves the distance between points. Therefore, after rotation, AB will still be equal to DE, and AC will still be equal to DF.\n\nAnother transformation mentioned is reflection. When triangle ABC is reflected, its sides will change direction, but their lengths will remain the same. This is because reflection is also an isometry, which means it preserves the distance between points. Therefore, after reflection, AB will still be equal to DE, and AC will still be equal to DF.\n\nThe last transformation mentioned is translation.

This is because translation is also an isometry, which means it preserves the distance between points. Therefore, after translation, AB will still be equal to DE, and AC will still be equal to DF.\n\nNow, let's consider the right angles in the triangles. We know that ∠ABC = ∠DEF = 90°. This means that the right angles in the triangles are preserved under the transformations. Since the right angles are preserved, the lengths of the sides adjacent to the right angles will also be preserved.\n\nIn particular, since AB = DE and AC = DF, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the lengths of the sides BC and EF. By the Pythagorean theorem, BC = √(AB^2 + AC^2) and EF = √(DE^2 + DF^2). Since AB = DE and AC = DF, we can substitute these equalities into the Pythagorean theorem to get BC = √(DE^2 + DF^2) = EF.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that the length of side AB is equal to the length of side DE, even after a series of transformations (rotation, reflection, translation) is applied to triangle ABC to transform it into triangle DEF.

The standard normal distribution table gives us the probability that a standard normal variable is less than a given z-score.\n\nLooking up the z-score of -4.37 in the standard normal distribution table, we find that the probability is approximately 0.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the sample proportion is less than 0.5 is approximately 0.\n\nThis result makes sense, since the sample proportion is unlikely to be less than 0.5 when the population proportion is 0.7. The sample proportion is more likely to be greater than 0.5, since the population proportion is greater than 0.5.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\n-- Define the normal distribution parameters\ndef μ : ℝ := 0.7\ndef n : ℕ := 100\ndef x : ℝ := 0.5\n\n-- Calculate the standard deviation\ndef σ : ℝ := Real.sqrt (μ * (1 - μ) / n)\n\n-- Calculate the z-score\ndef z_score : ℝ := (x - μ) / σ\n\n-- Define the probability function using the z-score\ndef probability_less_than_x : ℝ := \n  if z_score < 0 then 0.5 - Real.erf (z_score / Real.sqrt 2) / 2\n  else 0.5 + Real.erf (z_score / Real.sqrt 2) / 2\n\n-- Main theorem\ntheorem sample_proportion_less_than_0_5 : probability_less_than_x = 0 :=\nbegin\n  -- Calculate the z-score\n  have h_z_score : z_score = -4.37 :=\n  begin\n    -- Calculate the z-score\n    calc\n      z_score = (x - μ) / σ : rfl\n      ... = (0.5 - 0.7) / Real.sqrt (0.7 * (1 - 0.7) / 100) : rfl\n      ... = -0.2 / Real.sqrt (0.7 * 0.3 / 100) : rfl\n      ... = -0.2 / Real.sqrt (0.21 / 100) : rfl\n      ... = -0.2 / Real.sqrt 0.0021 : rfl\n      ... = -0.2 / 0.0459 : rfl\n      ... = -4.37 : rfl\n  end,\n  -- Use the z-score to calculate the probability\n  rw h_z_score,\n  -- Since z_score is negative, use the left tail of the normal distribution\n  have h_probability : probability_less_than_x = 0.5 - Real.erf (-4.37 / Real.sqrt 2) / 2 :=\n  begin\n    -- Use the definition of probability_less_than_x\n    rw probability_less_than_x,\n    -- Since z_score is negative, the condition is true\n    simp,\n  end,\n  -- Calculate the error function value\n  have h_erf : Real.erf (-4.37 / Real.sqrt 2) ≈ 1 :=\n  begin\n    -- Use the approximation of the error function\n    sorry -- This step requires numerical approximation or a known value of the error function\n  end,\n  -- Substitute the error function value\n  rw h_erf at h_probability,\n  -- Simplify the expression\n  simp at h_probability,\n  -- The probability is approximately 0\n  exact h_probability,\nend\n```",False

The first step is to get rid of the constant term +5 on the left-hand side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation.\n\nThis is similar to the technique used in the proof of the theorem x + 3 = 5, where -3 was added to both sides to isolate x. In this case, we are subtracting 5 from both sides, which is equivalent to adding -5 to both sides.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n2x + 5 - 5 = 15 - 5\n\nUsing the associative law of addition, we can rearrange the terms on the left-hand side:\n\n2x + (5 - 5) = 15 - 5\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n2x + 0 = 10\n\nNow, we can use the definition of subtraction to rewrite 0 as -5 + 5.

Similarly, $y + n$ can be rewritten as $\eqclass {c + n, d + n} {}$.\n\nSince we are adding the same number $n$ to both sides of the equation, the difference between the upper and lower bounds of $x + n$ and $y + n$ remains the same. This is because the addition of $n$ to both bounds of $x$ and $y$ results in the same increase in the upper bound and the same decrease in the lower bound.\n\nThis is where the commutative property of natural number addition comes into play.

In this case, we have triangles ∆DCF and ∆ECF, which have two sides (DC = CE and FC) and the included angle (∠DCF = ∠ECF) equal. Therefore, these triangles are congruent.\n\nNow, let's consider the given information: the slope of line AB (or CD) is 2, and the slope of line EF is -0.5.

What is the length of line EF?,1,1,"2659,124728,2133,2136,2131,2652","# Informal Proof:\n\nTo find the length of line EF, we need to understand the relationship between the given parallel lines AB and CD, and the intersecting line EF.\n\nFirst, let's recall the concept of parallel lines and the properties of the angles formed when a transversal intersects two parallel lines. In this case, we have a transversal line EF intersecting the parallel lines AB and CD.\n\nSince AB and CD are parallel, we know that the corresponding angles formed by the transversal EF are equal. This means that ∠AEF = ∠CDF.\n\nNow, let's consider the triangles AEF and CDF. We can use the Side-Angle-Side (SAS) congruence theorem to show that these triangles are congruent. The SAS theorem states that if two sides and the included angle of one triangle are equal to the corresponding two sides and the included angle of another triangle, then the two triangles are congruent.\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\n* AE = CD (given)\n* ∠AEF = ∠CDF (corresponding angles of parallel lines)\n* EF = EF (common side)\n\nTherefore, by the SAS congruence theorem, we can conclude that triangles AEF and CDF are congruent.\n\nSince the triangles are congruent, we can also conclude that the corresponding sides are equal. This means that:\n\n* AF = CF\n* AE = CD\n\nNow, let's consider the right triangle AEF. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of EF. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (EF) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (AE and AF).\n\nWe know that the slope of line AB is 2, and the slope of line EF is -0.5. We can use this information to find the lengths of AE and AF.\n\nLet's assume that the length of AE is x. Then, the length of AF is also x, since the triangles AEF and CDF are congruent.\n\nWe can use the slope formula to find the length of AE:\n\nm = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\n\nwhere m is the slope, and (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are the coordinates of the two points.\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\nm = 2 = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\n\nWe can simplify this equation to get:\n\ny2 - y1 = 2(x2 - x1)\n\nNow, let's substitute the coordinates of points A and E into this equation:\n\ny2 - y1 = 2(x2 - x1)\nyE - yA = 2(xE - xA)\n\nWe know that the length of AE is x, so we can substitute this value into the equation:\n\nyE - yA = 2(xE - xA)\nyE - yA = 2x\n\nNow, let's consider the right triangle AEF.

Since there are 200 girls in the school and we need to select one girl, there are 200 possible choices for the girl.\n\nNext, we need to select two boys for the team. Since there are 300 boys in the school and we need to select two boys, we can use the concept of permutations to find the number of ways to select the boys. The number of permutations of 2 out of 300 is given by ${}^2 P_{300} = \dfrac{300!}{(300-2)!}$. However, this is a complex calculation and can be simplified using the fact that ${}^2 P_{300} = \dfrac{300!}{298!} = 300 \times 299 = 89700$.\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of teams that can be selected.

Our goal is to show that the Wronskian W(y1, y2) = y1(x)y2'(x) - y2(x)y1'(x) has this property.\n\nFirst, we recall that the Wronskian is defined as the determinant of the matrix:\n\n| y1  y2 |\n| ---  --- |\n| y1' y2' |\n\nWe are interested in the expression W(y1, y2) = y1(x)y2'(x) - y2(x)y1'(x), which is the top-left entry of this matrix.\n\nTo find the derivative of the Wronskian, we apply the product rule for derivatives, which states that if we have two functions u(x) and v(x), then the derivative of their product is given by:\n\n(uv)' = u'v + uv'\n\nIn our case, we have:\n\nW(y1, y2)' = (y1y2')' - (y2y1')'\n\nUsing the product rule, we can expand this expression as:\n\nW(y1, y2)' = y1'y2'' + y1''y2' - y2'y1'' - y2''y1'\n\nNow, we can simplify this expression by combining like terms:\n\nW(y1, y2)' = y1y2'' - y2y1''\n\nThis is the derivative of the Wronskian.\n\nNext, we recall that y1(x) and y2(x) are solutions to the given ODE.

(3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6).\n\nThe probability of each outcome is 1/36.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the probability distribution of X.\n\nThe possible values of X are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12.\n\nThe probability of each value is given by the sum of the probabilities of the outcomes that result in that value.\n\nFor example, the probability of X = 2 is the probability of the outcome (1,1), which is 1/36.\n\nThe probability of X = 3 is the probability of the outcomes (1,2) and (2,1), which is 2/36.\n\nThe probability of X = 4 is the probability of the outcomes (1,3), (2,2), and (3,1), which is 3/36.\n\n...\n\nThe probability of X = 12 is the probability of the outcome (6,6), which is 1/36.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the probability generating function (PGF) for X.\n\nThe PGF for X is given by $\map {\Pi_X} s = \sum_{x \mathop \ge 0} \map p x s^x$, where $\map p x$ is the probability of X taking the value x.\n\nUsing the probabilities calculated in Step 3, we can write the PGF as:\n\n$\map {\Pi_X} s = \frac{1}{36} s^2 + \frac{2}{36} s^3 + \frac{3}{36} s^4 + \frac{4}{36} s^5 + \frac{5}{36} s^6 + \frac{6}{36} s^7 + \frac{5}{36} s^8 + \frac{4}{36} s^9 + \frac{3}{36} s^{10} + \frac{2}{36} s^{11} + \frac{1}{36} s^{12}$\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the expected value (E[X]) of X.\n\nThe expected value of X is given by the first derivative of the PGF evaluated at s = 1.\n\nUsing the chain rule and the power rule for derivatives, we can calculate the first derivative of the PGF as:\n\n$\map {\Pi'_X} s = \frac{1}{36} (2s + 3s^2 + 4s^3 + 5s^4 + 6s^5 + 7s^6 + 8s^7 + 9s^8 + 10s^9 + 11s^{10} + 12s^{11})$\n\nEvaluating this derivative at s = 1, we get:\n\n$\map {\Pi'_X} 1 = \frac{1}{36} (2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12) = \frac{73}{36}$\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the expected value (E[Y]) of Y.\n\nThe expected value of Y is given by the expected value of the square root of X.\n\nUsing the definition of the expected value, we can write:\n\n$E[Y] = E[\sqrt{X}] = \sum_{x \mathop \ge 0} \sqrt{x} \map p x$\n\nUsing the probabilities calculated in Step 3, we can write:\n\n$E[Y] = \frac{1}{36} \sqrt{2} + \frac{2}{36} \sqrt{3} + \frac{3}{36} \sqrt{4} + \frac{4}{36} \sqrt{5} + \frac{5}{36} \sqrt{6} + \frac{6}{36} \sqrt{7} + \frac{5}{36} \sqrt{8} + \frac{4}{36} \sqrt{9} + \frac{3}{36} \sqrt{10} + \frac{2}{36} \sqrt{11} + \frac{1}{36} \sqrt{12}$\n\n## Step 7: Simplify the expression for E[Y].\n\nUsing the properties of square roots, we can simplify the expression for E[Y] as:\n\n$E[Y] = \frac{1}{36} (\sqrt{2} + 2\sqrt{3} + 3\sqrt{4} + 4\sqrt{5} + 5\sqrt{6} + 6\sqrt{7} + 5\sqrt{8} + 4\sqrt{9} + 3\sqrt{10} + 2\sqrt{11} + \sqrt{12})$\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the second derivative of the PGF.\n\nThe second derivative of the PGF is given by:\n\n$\map {\Pi''_X} s = \frac{1}{36} (2 + 6s + 12s^2 + 20s^3 + 30s^4 + 42s^5 + 56s^6 + 72s^7 + 90s^8 + 110s^9 + 132s^{10} + 156s^{11})$\n\n## Step 9: Evaluate the second derivative of the PGF at s = 1.\n\nEvaluating the second derivative of the PGF at s = 1, we get:\n\n$\map {\Pi''_X} 1 = \frac{1}{36} (2 + 6 + 12 + 20 + 30 + 42 + 56 + 72 + 90 + 110 + 132 + 156) = \frac{730}{36}$\n\n## Step 10: Calculate the expected value of X^2.\n\nThe expected value of X^2 is given by the second derivative of the PGF evaluated at s = 1.\n\nUsing the result from Step 9, we can write:\n\n$E[X^2] = \map {\Pi''_X} 1 + \map {\Pi'_X} 1 = \frac{730}{36} + \frac{73}{36} = \frac{803}{36}$\n\n## Step 11: Calculate the expected value of Y^2.\n\nThe expected value of Y^2 is given by the expected value of the square of X.\n\nUsing the definition of the expected value, we can write:\n\n$E[Y^2] = E[X^2] = \frac{803}{36}$\n\n## Step 12: Calculate the expected value of Y.\n\nThe expected value of Y is given by the square root of the expected value of Y^2.\n\nUsing the result from Step 11, we can write:\n\n$E[Y] = \sqrt{E[Y^2]} = \sqrt{\frac{803}{36}} = \frac{\sqrt{803}}{6}$",```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option

We are given that the length is 3 more than twice the width, so we can express the length in terms of the width as $l = 2w + 3$.\n\nThe perimeter of a rectangle is the sum of all its sides. Since a rectangle has two pairs of equal sides, we can express the perimeter as $2l + 2w$. We are given that the perimeter is 36 units, so we can set up the equation $2l + 2w = 36$.\n\nSubstituting the expression for the length in terms of the width, we get $2(2w + 3) + 2w = 36$. Expanding the equation, we get $4w + 6 + 2w = 36$. Combining like terms, we get $6w + 6 = 36$.\n\nSubtracting 6 from both sides of the equation, we get $6w = 30$. Dividing both sides of the equation by 6, we get $w = 5$.\n\nNow that we have found the width, we can find the length by substituting the value of the width into the expression for the length: $l = 2w + 3 = 2(5) + 3 = 10 + 3 = 13$.\n\nTherefore, the dimensions of the rectangle are a width of 5 units and a length of 13 units.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\ntheorem rectangle_dimensions (w l : ℕ) (h₁ : l = 2 * w + 3) (h₂ : 2 * l + 2 * w = 36) : w = 5 ∧ l = 13 := by\n  have h₃ : 2 * (2 * w + 3) + 2 * w = 36 := by rw [h₁] at h₂; exact h₂\n  simp at h₃\n  have h₄ : 6 * w + 6 = 36 := by linarith\n  have h₅ : 6 * w = 30 := by linarith\n  have h₆ : w = 5 := by linarith\n  have h₇ : l = 2 * 5 + 3 := by rw [h₆] at h₁; exact h₁\n  have h₈ : l = 13 := by linarith\n  exact ⟨h₆, h₈⟩\n```",True

This means that multiplying a number by 10 is equivalent to multiplying it by 10^1, which shifts the decimal point one place to the right.\n\nNow, let's consider the general case of 10^n. We can express 10^n as (10^1)^n, using the property of exponents that states (a^m)^n = a^(m*n). This means that 10^n is essentially 10 raised to the power of n.\n\nWhen we multiply a number by 10^n, we are essentially multiplying it by (10^1)^n. This is equivalent to multiplying the number by 10^1, n times in succession. Each time we multiply by 10^1, we shift the decimal point one place to the right.\n\nTherefore, multiplying a number by 10^n is equivalent to shifting the decimal point n places to the right, as each multiplication by 10^1 shifts the decimal point one place to the right, and this process is repeated n times.\n\nThis reasoning is closely related to the concept of exponentiation and the properties of the number 10. It also relies on the idea of repeated multiplication, which is a fundamental concept in arithmetic.\n\nThe key insight here is that 10^n can be expressed as (10^1)^n, allowing us to break down the multiplication process into a series of single-digit multiplications by 10^1.

This is equivalent to finding the cardinality of the union of the three sets $A$, $B$, and $C$, denoted as $|A \cup B \cup C|$.\n\nUsing the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle, we can express the cardinality of the union of three sets as:\n\n$|A \cup B \cup C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A \cap B| - |A \cap C| - |B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap C|$\n\nWe are given that $|A| = 25$, $|B| = 35$, and $|C| = 40$. However, we are not given the values of $|A \cap B|$, $|A \cap C|$, and $|B \cap C|$. We can, however, use the fact that the number of students who like all three fruits is equal to the intersection of the three sets, denoted as $|A \cap B \cap C|$.\n\nLet's denote the number of students who like all three fruits as $N$. Then, we have:\n\n$|A \cap B \cap C| = N$\n\nWe can also express the cardinality of the union of two sets as:\n\n$|A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|$\n\nUsing this formula, we can find the number of students who like apple and banana, but not cherry:\n\n$|A \cap B| = |A \cup B| - |C|$\n\nSimilarly, we can find the number of students who like apple and cherry, but not banana:\n\n$|A \cap C| = |A \cup C| - |B|$\n\nAnd, we can find the number of students who like banana and cherry, but not apple:\n\n$|B \cap C| = |B \cup C| - |A|$\n\nHowever, we are not given the values of $|A \cup B|$, $|A \cup C|$, and $|B \cup C|$. We can, however, use the fact that the cardinality of the union of three sets is equal to the sum of the cardinalities of the individual sets minus the sum of the cardinalities of the intersections of the sets.\n\nUsing this fact, we can express the cardinality of the union of three sets as:\n\n$|A \cup B \cup C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A \cap B| - |A \cap C| - |B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap C|$\n\nSubstituting the values of $|A|$, $|B|$, and $|C|$, we get:\n\n$|A \cup B \cup C| = 25 + 35 + 40 - |A \cap B| - |A \cap C| - |B \cap C| + N$\n\nWe are also given that the total number of students who like apple, banana, or cherry is 75. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\n$|A \cup B \cup C| = 75$\n\nSubstituting the expression for $|A \cup B \cup C|$, we get:\n\n$25 + 35 + 40 - |A \cap B| - |A \cap C| - |B \cap C| + N = 75$\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n$100 - |A \cap B| - |A \cap C| - |B \cap C| + N = 75$\n\nSubtracting 100 from both sides, we get:\n\n$- |A \cap B| - |A \cap C| - |B \cap C| + N = -25$\n\nAdding $|A \cap B| + |A \cap C| + |B \cap C|$ to both sides, we get:\n\n$N = |A \cap B| + |A \cap C| + |B \cap C| - 25$\n\nWe are also given that the number of students who like all three fruits is 5. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\n$N = 5$\n\nSubstituting this value into the equation, we get:\n\n$5 = |A \cap B| + |A \cap C| + |B \cap C| - 25$\n\nAdding 25 to both sides, we get:\n\n$30 = |A \cap B| + |A \cap C| + |B \cap C|$\n\nWe are also given that the number of students who like apple and banana, but not cherry is 15. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\n$|A \cap B| = 15$\n\nSubstituting this value into the equation, we get:\n\n$30 = 15 + |A \cap C| + |B \cap C|$\n\nSubtracting 15 from both sides, we get:\n\n$15 = |A \cap C| + |B \cap C|$\n\nWe are also given that the number of students who like apple and cherry, but not banana is 10. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\n$|A \cap C| = 10$\n\nSubstituting this value into the equation, we get:\n\n$15 = 10 + |B \cap C|$\n\nSubtracting 10 from both sides, we get:\n\n$5 = |B \cap C|$\n\nTherefore, we have found the values of $|A \cap B|$, $|A \cap C|$, and $|B \cap C|$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation for $|A \cup B \cup C|$, we get:\n\n$|A \cup B \cup C| = 25 + 35 + 40 - 15 - 10 - 5 + 5$\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n$|A \cup B \cup C| = 75$\n\nTherefore, the total number of students who like apple, banana, or cherry is 75.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\n-- In a class survey, it was found that 25 students like apple, 35 students like banana, and 40 students like cherry.\n-- What is the total number of students who like apple, banana, or cherry?\n\n-- We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to solve this problem.\n\n-- Let A be the set of students who like apple, B be the set of students who like banana, and C be the set of students who like cherry.\n-- We are given:\n-- |A| = 25, |B| = 35, |C| = 40\n\n-- We want to find |A ∪ B ∪ C|\n\n-- Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion:\n-- |A ∪ B ∪ C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ C|\n\n-- We are given that the number of students who like all three fruits is 5.\n-- So, |A ∩ B ∩ C| = 5\n\n-- We are also given that the number of students who like apple and banana, but not cherry is 15.\n-- So, |A ∩ B| = 15\n\n-- We are also given that the number of students who like apple and cherry, but not banana is 10.\n-- So, |A ∩ C| = 10\n\n-- We are also given that the number of students who like banana and cherry, but not apple is 20.\n-- So, |B ∩ C| = 20\n\n-- Now, we can substitute these values into the inclusion-exclusion formula:\n\n-- |A ∪ B ∪ C| = 25 + 35 + 40 - 15 - 10 - 20 + 5\n\n-- Simplifying this, we get:\n\n-- |A ∪ B ∪ C| = 75\n\n-- Therefore, the total number of students who like apple, banana, or cherry is 75.\n\ntheorem total_students_liking_fruits : \n  (Finset.card (Finset.univ : Finset (Fin 100)) - \n   (Finset.card (Finset.filter (fun x => x < 25) Finset.univ) + \n    Finset.card (Finset.filter (fun x => x < 60) Finset.univ) + \n    Finset.card (Finset.filter (fun x => x < 100) Finset.univ)) + \n   (Finset.card (Finset.filter (fun x => x < 15) Finset.univ) + \n    Finset.card (Finset.filter (fun x => x < 25) Finset.univ) + \n    Finset.card (Finset.filter (fun x => x < 40) Finset.univ)) - \n   (Finset.card (Finset.filter (fun x => x < 10) Finset.univ) + \n    Finset.card (Finset.filter (fun x => x < 20) Finset.univ) + \n    Finset.card (Finset.filter (fun x => x < 35) Finset.univ)) + \n   Finset.card (Finset.filter (fun x => x < 5) Finset.univ)) = 75 :=\nby\n  simp [Finset.card_univ, Finset.card_filter]\n  norm_num\n```",False

In other words, the jth column of P is the coordinate vector [wj]B of the jth basis vector wj of C with respect to the basis B.\n\nNow, let's consider the coordinate vector [x]B of the vector x with respect to the basis B. This vector is a linear combination of the basis vectors of B, with coefficients that represent the coordinates of x with respect to B.\n\nWhen we multiply the change of basis matrix P by the coordinate vector [x]B, we are essentially transforming the coordinates of x with respect to B into the coordinates of x with respect to C. This is because the columns of P represent the change of basis from B to C, and multiplying P by [x]B applies this change of basis to the coordinates of x.\n\nTherefore, the product P[x]B represents the coordinate vector of x with respect to the basis C, which is precisely what we want to prove.

A rectangle is a quadrilateral with four right angles and opposite sides of equal length. In this case, we have a rectangle ABCD with AB = a and BC = b.\n\nNow, let's consider the diagonal AC. We are given that the diagonal AC is transformed to form a new line segment AE such that AE = AB + BC. This means that AE is the sum of the lengths of AB and BC.\n\nTo find the area of triangle ABE, we can use the fact that the area of a triangle is half the product of its base and height. In this case, the base of triangle ABE is AB, and the height is the perpendicular distance from point E to line AB.\n\nHowever, we don't have the height of triangle ABE directly. But we can use the properties of the rectangle ABCD to find the height. Since ABCD is a rectangle, the diagonal AC bisects the rectangle into two congruent triangles. This means that the height of triangle ABE is equal to the height of the rectangle ABCD.\n\nNow, let's find the area of the rectangle ABCD. The area of a rectangle is given by the product of its length and width. In this case, the length is AB = a, and the width is BC = b. So, the area of the rectangle ABCD is ab.\n\nSince the height of triangle ABE is equal to the height of the rectangle ABCD, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle to find the area of triangle ABE. The area of triangle ABE is half the product of its base (AB) and height (the height of the rectangle ABCD).\n\nNow, let's substitute the values of AB and the height of the rectangle ABCD into the formula for the area of triangle ABE. We get:\n\nArea of triangle ABE = (1/2) × AB × (height of rectangle ABCD)\n\nSince the height of triangle ABE is equal to the height of the rectangle ABCD, we can substitute the value of the height of the rectangle ABCD into the formula. We get:\n\nArea of triangle ABE = (1/2) × AB × (b)\n\nNow, let's simplify the expression. We know that AB = a, so we can substitute this value into the expression. We get:\n\nArea of triangle ABE = (1/2) × a × b\n\nThis is equal to half the area of the rectangle ABCD. Therefore, we have proved that the area of triangle ABE is half of the rectangle ABCD.\n\nThe key insight in this proof is the use of the properties of the rectangle ABCD to find the height of triangle ABE.

Since it's a rectangle, we know that opposite sides are equal and parallel, and all internal angles are right angles. This means that the area of the rectangle can be calculated as the product of its length and width, which is ab.\n\nNow, let's focus on the triangle ABE. We can see that it's formed by the new line segment AE and the original side AB. To find the area of this triangle, we need to determine its base and height.\n\nNotice that the line segment AE is the sum of the original sides AB and BC. This means that AE is equal to the length of the rectangle plus the width of the rectangle. In other words, AE = a + b.\n\nSince AE is the base of the triangle ABE, we can see that it's equal to the sum of the length and width of the rectangle. This is a key insight, as it allows us to relate the area of the triangle to the area of the rectangle.\n\nTo find the height of the triangle ABE, we can draw a perpendicular line from point E to the side AB. Let's call the point where this line intersects AB as point F. Since the line EF is perpendicular to AB, we can see that it's also perpendicular to the side BC of the rectangle.\n\nNow, let's consider the triangle EFC. We can see that it's a right-angled triangle with EF as the height and FC as the base. Since FC is equal to the width of the rectangle (which is b), we can see that the area of the triangle EFC is equal to half of the area of the rectangle.\n\nBut wait, we've already established that the area of the triangle ABE is equal to the area of the triangle EFC!

We want to perform a significance test (hypothesis testing) under the null hypothesis that the new teaching method has no effect, against the alternative hypothesis that it does have a positive effect. Assume the significance level is 0.05. Can we reject the null hypothesis?",0,1,131336,"# Informal Proof:\n\nTo determine whether we can reject the null hypothesis, we need to perform a significance test. The null hypothesis states that the new teaching method has no effect, which means that the mean score of the students should still be 80. The alternative hypothesis states that the new teaching method has a positive effect, which means that the mean score of the students should be greater than 80.\n\nWe are given that the mean score of the 30 students is 85, which is greater than 80. To test whether this difference is statistically significant, we can use the t-test. The t-test is a statistical test that compares the mean of a sample to a known population mean.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the standard error of the mean (SEM) of the sample. The SEM is given by the formula:\n\nSEM = σ / √n\n\nwhere σ is the standard deviation of the population and n is the sample size. In this case, σ = 10 and n = 30, so:\n\nSEM = 10 / √30 ≈ 1.85\n\nNext, we need to calculate the t-statistic, which is given by the formula:\n\nt = (x̄ - μ) / SEM\n\nwhere x̄ is the sample mean, μ is the population mean, and SEM is the standard error of the mean. In this case, x̄ = 85, μ = 80, and SEM ≈ 1.85, so:\n\nt = (85 - 80) / 1.85 ≈ 4.32\n\nThe t-statistic tells us how many standard errors away from the population mean our sample mean is. In this case, the t-statistic is approximately 4.32, which means that the sample mean is approximately 4.32 standard errors away from the population mean.\n\nTo determine whether we can reject the null hypothesis, we need to compare the t-statistic to the critical t-value.

Since he saved $5 each day for 10 days, the total amount he saved in the first 10 days is $5 \times 10 = $50.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the amount he saved in the next 20 days. Since he saved $10 each day for 20 days, the total amount he saved in the next 20 days is $10 \times 20 = $200.\n\nNow, we need to add the amount he saved in the first 10 days to the amount he saved in the next 20 days to find the total amount he saved. Therefore, the total amount he saved is $50 + $200 = $250.\n\nThis is a straightforward calculation, and we don't need to use any complex mathematical expressions or theorems to solve this problem. However, if we want to relate this problem to the context provided, we can see that the problem is similar to the ""Dollars and Cents"" puzzle, where we need to find the amount of money a person had initially based on certain conditions.\n\nIn the context provided, we used the conversion factor of $100$ cents making one dollar to convert cent quantities to dollar quantities. Similarly, in this problem, we can convert the amount John saved in dollars to cents by multiplying it by $100$. Therefore, the total amount he saved in cents is $250 \times 100 = 25000$ cents.\n\nHowever, this is not the final answer we are looking for. We want to find the total amount he saved in dollars and cents. Since we already know that the total amount he saved is $250, we can express it in dollars and cents as $250.00.\n\nTherefore, the total amount John saved is $250.00.",# Start\n```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\n-- Define a function to calculate the total savings\ndef totalSavings (first10Days : Nat) (next20Days : Nat) : Nat :=\n  (first10Days * 10) + (next20Days * 20)\n\n-- Calculate the total savings for John\ndef johnsTotalSavings : Nat :=\n  totalSavings 5 10\n\n-- Verify the calculation\nexample : johnsTotalSavings = 250 :=\n  rfl\n```  # End,True

In this case, the dividend is 7.5 and the divisor is 2.5.\n\nWe can start by recognizing that 7.5 is equivalent to 15/2, and 2.5 is equivalent to 5/2. This is based on the fact that we can express decimal numbers as fractions by considering the place value of each digit. For example, 7.5 can be written as 7 + 0.5, and 0.5 is equivalent to 1/2. Similarly, 2.5 can be written as 2 + 0.5, and again 0.5 is equivalent to 1/2.\n\nNow, we can rewrite the division problem as a fraction: (15/2) / (5/2). To divide fractions, we can multiply the first fraction by the reciprocal of the second fraction. The reciprocal of 5/2 is 2/5.\n\nSo, we can rewrite the division problem as (15/2) * (2/5).

We are given two measuring cups, one with 500ml of water and the other with 300ml of water. We can think of this problem as a series of operations on the two cups, where we pour water from one cup to the other.\n\nLet's denote the 500ml cup as $V_{500}$ and the 300ml cup as $V_{300}$. We can represent the initial state of the cups as:\n\n$\begin{array}{c|c} V_{500} & V_{300} \\ \hline\n500 & 0 \\\n0 & 300 \\\n\end{array}$\n\nNow, let's consider the operations we can perform on the cups. We can pour water from one cup to the other, but we can't pour water from one cup to the other if the other cup is empty. We can also pour water from one cup to the other if the other cup has enough space to hold the water.\n\nWe can represent the operations as a series of steps, where we pour water from one cup to the other.

When we multiply 10 by the smallest three-digit number, 100, we get 1000, a four-digit number. This shows that even the smallest possible product is a four-digit number.\n\nNow, let's consider the largest two-digit number, which is 99. When we multiply 99 by the largest three-digit number, 999, we get 98001, a five-digit number. This shows that even the largest possible product is a five-digit number.\n\nSince we've considered the smallest and largest possible products, we can conclude that all products of two-digit and three-digit numbers will fall within the range of four to five digits.\n\nTo further solidify this argument, let's consider the general form of a two-digit number, which is 10a + b, where a and b are the tens and units digits, respectively. Similarly, the general form of a three-digit number is 100c + d + e, where c, d, and e are the hundreds, tens, and units digits, respectively.\n\nWhen we multiply these two numbers, we get:\n\n(10a + b) × (100c + d + e)\n\nUsing the distributive property, we can expand this product as:\n\n1000ac + 100ad + 100ae + 10bc + 10bd + 10be + bde\n\nNow, let's examine the terms in this product.

The remaining terms, 100ad, 100ae, 10bc, 10bd, 10be, and bde, are all less than 1000, so they contribute to the product without increasing its digit count beyond four or five.\n\nTherefore, the product of a two-digit number and a three-digit number is always a four or five-digit number, as required.\n\nThis informal proof provides a clear and intuitive explanation of why the product of a two-digit number and a three-digit number is always a four or five-digit number.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\n-- Prove that if you multiply a two-digit number by a three-digit number, the result will always be a four or five-digit number.\ntheorem two_digit_times_three_digit_is_four_or_five_digit : \n  ∀ (a b c d e : ℕ), \n  a ∈ Finset.range 10 ∧ b ∈ Finset.range 10 ∧ c ∈ Finset.range 10 ∧ d ∈ Finset.range 10 ∧ e ∈ Finset.range 10 →\n  (10 * a + b) * (100 * c + d * 10 + e) ≥ 1000 ∧ (10 * a + b) * (100 * c + d * 10 + e) ≤ 99999 :=\nbegin\n  intros a b c d e h,\n  cases h with h1 h2,\n  cases h2 with h2 h3,\n  cases h3 with h3 h4,\n  cases h4 with h4 h5,\n  split,\n  { -- Show that the product is at least 1000\n    calc\n      (10 * a + b) * (100 * c + d * 10 + e) ≥ 10 * 10 * 100 : by linarith\n      ... = 1000 : by ring },\n  { -- Show that the product is at most 99999\n    calc\n      (10 * a + b) * (100 * c + d * 10 + e) ≤ 99 * 999 : by linarith\n      ... = 99999 : by ring }\nend\n```",False

This suggests that the product will always be a four or five-digit number.\n\nTo confirm this, let's consider the range of possible products. Since the smallest two-digit number is 10 and the largest is 99, the range of possible two-digit numbers is 90 (99 - 10 + 1). Similarly, since the smallest three-digit number is 100 and the largest is 999, the range of possible three-digit numbers is 900 (999 - 100 + 1).\n\nWhen we multiply these ranges together, we get a range of possible products that is at least 90 × 900 = 81000.

This is because the square on the hypotenuse is made up of the squares on the legs, plus the additional area formed by the right angle.\n\nMathematically, this can be expressed as:\n\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2\n\nThis shows that the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the square root of the sum of the squares of the two legs (a and b).\n\nIn conclusion, we have used the Pythagorean theorem and the concept of similar triangles to prove that the length of the hypotenuse (c) in a right triangle is equal to the square root of the sum of the squares of the two legs (a and b).","```lean4\nimport Mathlib.Data.Real.Basic\n\ntheorem pythagorean_theorem (a b : ℝ) (h : a ≥ 0 ∧ b ≥ 0) :\n  ∃ c : ℝ, c ≥ 0 ∧ c = Real.sqrt (a^2 + b^2) := by\n  use Real.sqrt (a^2 + b^2)\n  constructor\n  · exact Real.sqrt_nonneg (a^2 + b^2)\n  · exact Real.sqrt_sq (by linarith [h.1, h.2])\n```",False

Then, we put a ball back into the box. The color of the ball we put back is the same as the color of the last ball we took out. Finally, we take one ball from the box. What is the probability that the last ball is red?",0,1,121937,"# Informal Proof:\n\nTo find the probability that the last ball is red, we need to consider the different possible scenarios that can occur. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, we take 2 balls out of the box without replacement. This can be thought of as a sequence of two events: the first ball is drawn, and then the second ball is drawn. Since the balls are not replaced, the probability of drawing a red ball on the second draw depends on the color of the first ball drawn.\n\nWe can use the concept of conditional probability to analyze this situation. Let's define the events:\n\n* R: the first ball drawn is red\n* B: the first ball drawn is blue\n* G: the first ball drawn is green\n* R2: the second ball drawn is red\n\nWe want to find P(R2), the probability that the second ball drawn is red.\n\nUsing the law of total probability, we can write:\n\nP(R2) = P(R2|R)P(R) + P(R2|B)P(B) + P(R2|G)P(G)\n\nNow, let's analyze each term:\n\n* P(R2|R)P(R) is the probability that the second ball drawn is red, given that the first ball drawn is red, multiplied by the probability that the first ball drawn is red. Since the first ball drawn is red, there are 4 red balls left out of a total of 12 balls. So, P(R2|R) = 4/12 and P(R) = 5/12.\n* P(R2|B)P(B) is the probability that the second ball drawn is red, given that the first ball drawn is blue, multiplied by the probability that the first ball drawn is blue. Since the first ball drawn is blue, there are 5 red balls left out of a total of 12 balls. So, P(R2|B) = 5/12 and P(B) = 4/12.\n* P(R2|G)P(G) is the probability that the second ball drawn is red, given that the first ball drawn is green, multiplied by the probability that the first ball drawn is green. Since the first ball drawn is green, there are 5 red balls left out of a total of 12 balls. So, P(R2|G) = 5/12 and P(G) = 3/12.\n\nNow, we can plug in the values:\n\nP(R2) = (4/12)(5/12) + (5/12)(4/12) + (5/12)(3/12)\n= (20/144) + (20/144) + (15/144)\n= 55/144\n\nNext, we put a ball back into the box, which is the same color as the last ball we took out. This means that the probability of drawing a red ball on the third draw is the same as the probability of drawing a red ball on the second draw, which is 55/144.\n\nFinally, we take one ball from the box. We want to find the probability that the last ball is red. Since we have already drawn two balls, there are 11 balls left in the box, and 5 of them are red. So, the probability that the last ball is red is 5/11.\n\nHowever, we need to consider the case where the last ball is red, given that the second ball is red. In this case, the probability that the last ball is red is 4/11, since there are 4 red balls left out of a total of 11 balls.\n\nUsing the law of total probability again, we can write:\n\nP(last ball is red) = P(last ball is red|second ball is red)P(second ball is red) + P(last ball is red|second ball is not red)P(second ball is not red)\n\nWe know that P(second ball is red) = 55/144, and P(last ball is red|second ball is red) = 4/11. We also know that P(second ball is not red) = 1 - P(second ball is red) = 89/144, and P(last ball is red|second ball is not red) = 5/11.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nP(last ball is red) = (4/11)(55/144) + (5/11)(89/144)\n= (220/1584) + (445/1584)\n= 665/1584\n\nTherefore, the probability that the last ball is red is 665/1584.",```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\ntheorem last_ball_red_probability : \n  (5 * 4 + 5 * 3) / (12 * 11) = 3 / 11 := by\n  norm_num\n```,True

Since the order in which we draw the cards matters (i.e., drawing card A first and then card B is different from drawing card B first and then card A), we need to use the concept of permutations. The total number of ways to draw two cards from a deck of 52 cards is given by the permutation formula P(n, k) = n! / (n-k)!, where n is the total number of items (52 cards in this case) and k is the number of items being chosen (2 cards in this case).

This is a straightforward implication, as any multiple of 9 will also be a multiple of 3.\n\nNow, let's consider the reverse implication: if a number is divisible by 3, is it necessarily divisible by 9? This is where the rule of transposition comes in. We can use the fact that if a number is divisible by 3, it can be expressed as 3 times some integer k.

To do this, we can use the definition of the function and the properties of linear functions.\n\nWe know that f(x) = 3x + 2, so we can substitute x = 4 into the function to get f(4) = 3(4) + 2 = 14. This shows that the value of the function at x = 4 is indeed 14.\n\nNext, we need to show that for any positive real number ε, no matter how small, there exists a positive real number δ such that for all x, if 0 < |x - 4| < δ, then |f(x) - 14| < ε. To do this, we can use the fact that the function is linear and the properties of absolute value.\n\nWe can start by rewriting the expression |f(x) - 14| as |3x + 2 - 14| = |3x - 12|. This simplifies the expression and makes it easier to work with.\n\nNow, we can use the triangle inequality to get |3x - 12| ≤ |3||x - 4| = 3|x - 4|. This shows that the absolute value of the difference between f(x) and 14 is less than or equal to 3 times the absolute value of the difference between x and 4.\n\nFinally, we can choose δ to be any positive real number such that 3|x - 4| < ε. This ensures that |f(x) - 14| < ε, which is what we wanted to show.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that for any positive real number ε, no matter how small, there exists a positive real number δ such that for all x, if 0 < |x - 4| < δ, then |f(x) - 14| < ε.

To do this, we can use the power rule of integration, which states that the integral of x^n is (x^(n+1))/(n+1).\n\nApplying this rule to our function f(x) = 2x, we get:\n\n∫[0, 3] 2x dx = 2 ∫[0, 3] x dx\n\nUsing the power rule, we can evaluate the integral as:\n\n2 ∫[0, 3] x dx = 2 [(x^2)/2] from 0 to 3\n\nEvaluating the expression, we get:\n\n2 [(x^2)/2] from 0 to 3 = 2 [(3^2)/2 - (0^2)/2]\n\nSimplifying the expression, we get:\n\n2 [(3^2)/2 - (0^2)/2] = 2 [(9)/2 - 0]\n\nFurther simplifying, we get:\n\n2 [(9)/2 - 0] = 2 (9/2)\n\nFinally, simplifying the expression, we get:\n\n2 (9/2) = 9\n\nTherefore, the integral of the function f(x) = 2x from 0 to 3 equals 9.\n\nThis result is consistent with the fundamental theorem of calculus, which states that the definite integral of a function f(x) from a to b is equal to F(b) - F(a), where F(x) is the antiderivative of f(x).\n\nIn this case, the antiderivative of f(x) = 2x is F(x) = x^2. Evaluating F(x) at the endpoints of the interval [0, 3], we get:\n\nF(3) = 3^2 = 9\n\nF(0) = 0^2 = 0\n\nTherefore, the definite integral of f(x) = 2x from 0 to 3 is equal to F(3) - F(0) = 9 - 0 = 9.\n\nThis result confirms that the integral of the function f(x) = 2x from 0 to 3 equals 9.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\n-- Prove that the integral of the function f(x) = 2x from 0 to 3 equals 9.\ntheorem integral_of_2x_from_0_to_3 : ∫ x in 0..3, 2 * x = 9 := by\n  -- Use the power rule of integration to evaluate the integral.\n  simp only [integral_of_2x_from_0_to_3, mul_comm, mul_one, mul_div_cancel_left]\n  -- Apply the fundamental theorem of calculus.\n  apply integral_eq_of_has_deriv_at\n  -- Define the antiderivative of f(x) = 2x.\n  intro x\n  apply has_deriv_at_id\n  -- Evaluate the antiderivative at the endpoints of the interval [0, 3].\n  simp only [id.def, zero_add, zero_mul, sub_zero, mul_one, mul_div_cancel_left]\n  -- Calculate the difference to confirm the result.\n  norm_num\n```",False

This means that the amount of money John has left is the difference between the initial amount and the amount spent.\n\nLet's denote the initial amount as $S$ and the amount spent as $F$. We can express $S$ as $10 dollars and $0 cents, and $F$ as $3 dollars and $0 cents.\n\nWe are given that John spent half of the money that was in his pocket, which can be expressed as $S = 2F$.

The mean is the average of all the values in the data set. To find the mean, we need to add up all the values and then divide by the total number of values.\n\nThe data set is: 12, 15, 11, 14, 13, 15, 12. Let's add up these values: 12 + 15 = 27, 27 + 11 = 38, 38 + 14 = 52, 52 + 13 = 65, 65 + 15 = 80, 80 + 12 = 92. The sum of all the values is 92.\n\nNext, we need to divide the sum by the total number of values, which is 7. So, the mean is 92 / 7 = 13.14 (rounded to two decimal places).\n\nNow, let's calculate the median. The median is the middle value in the data set when it is arranged in order from smallest to largest.\n\nFirst, we need to arrange the data set in order: 11, 12, 12, 13, 14, 15, 15. Since there are 7 values (an odd number), the middle value is the fourth value, which is 13.\n\nTherefore, the mean of the data set is 13.14 and the median is 13.\n\nThis result makes sense because the median is the middle value, and in this case, it is the fourth value when the data set is arranged in order. The mean, on the other hand, is the average of all the values, which is slightly higher than the median due to the presence of the higher values 15 and 15.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\ndef dataSet : List Nat := [12, 15, 11, 14, 13, 15, 12]\n\ndef mean (data : List Nat) : Float :=\n  let sum := data.foldl (· + ·) 0\n  let count := data.length\n  if count = 0 then 0 else (sum : Float) / (count : Float)\n\ndef median (data : List Nat) : Nat :=\n  let sortedData := data.sort\n  let len := sortedData.length\n  if len % 2 = 1 then\n    sortedData[len / 2]\n  else\n    (sortedData[len / 2 - 1] + sortedData[len / 2]) / 2\n\n#eval mean dataSet\n#eval median dataSet\n```",False

We are given a rectangle with a length of 8 units and a width of -3 units.

In this case, the original length is 8 units and the original width is -3 units.\n\nWhen we increase the length by -5 units, we are essentially decreasing the length by 5 units. So, the new length will be $8 - 5 = 3$ units. Similarly, when we increase the width by 2 units, the new width will be $-3 + 2 = -1$ units.\n\nNow, we can use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle to find the perimeter of the new rectangle.

Similarly, the vector addition a + b is defined as the result of adding corresponding components of a and b.\n\nNow, let's consider the expression c*(a+b). Using the definition of scalar multiplication, we can expand this expression as follows:\n\nc*(a+b) = c*a + c*b\n\nThis is because the scalar multiplication c is applied to each component of the vector sum (a+b), resulting in the sum of the scalar multiples of a and b.\n\nTo see why this is true, let's consider a specific example. Suppose a = (2, 3) and b = (4, 5). Then, the vector sum a+b would be (6, 8). If we apply the scalar c = 2 to this vector sum, we get:\n\nc*(a+b) = 2*(6, 8) = (12, 16)\n\nOn the other hand, if we apply the scalar c to each component of a and b separately, we get:\n\nc*a = 2*(2, 3) = (4, 6)\nc*b = 2*(4, 5) = (8, 10)\n\nThen, the sum of these two scalar multiples is:\n\nc*a + c*b = (4, 6) + (8, 10) = (12, 16)\n\nAs we can see, the result of applying the scalar c to the vector sum a+b is the same as the result of applying the scalar c to each component of a and b separately.\n\nThis example illustrates the distributive property of scalar multiplication over vector addition, which is a fundamental property of real vector spaces. In general, for any scalar c and any vectors a and b in V, we have:\n\nc*(a+b) = c*a + c*b\n\nThis property is essential in many areas of mathematics and physics, and it has numerous applications in fields such as linear algebra, calculus, and differential equations.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\n-- Define the theorem statement\ntheorem scalar_distributive_over_vector_addition (c : ℝ) (a b : V) : c • (a + b) = c • a + c • b :=\nbegin\n  -- Use the distributive property of scalar multiplication over vector addition\n  rw smul_add,\nend\n```",False

If the company made a profit of $1000 in the first month, what is the company's profit in the 8th month?",0,1,101033,"# Informal Proof:\n\nTo find the company's profit in the 8th month, we need to understand the pattern of the monthly profit decrease. We are given that the monthly profit decrease is consistently $200, and the company made a profit of $1000 in the first month.\n\nLet's denote the profit in the first month as $P_1 = 1000$. Since the profit decreases by $200 each month, the profit in the second month will be $P_2 = P_1 - 200 = 800$. Similarly, the profit in the third month will be $P_3 = P_2 - 200 = 600$, and so on.\n\nWe can see that the profit in each month is decreasing by a fixed amount of $200. This is a classic example of an arithmetic sequence, where each term is obtained by subtracting a fixed constant from the previous term.\n\nTo find the profit in the 8th month, we need to subtract $200 from the profit in the first month, 7 times. This can be represented as:\n\n$P_8 = P_1 - 7 \times 200$\n\nSubstituting the value of $P_1$, we get:\n\n$P_8 = 1000 - 7 \times 200$\n\n$P_8 = 1000 - 1400$\n\n$P_8 = -400$\n\nHowever, this is not the correct answer.

In the second month, the profit is $800, which is $200 less than the previous month. In the third month, the profit is $600, which is $200 less than the previous month, and so on.\n\nWe can see that the profit is decreasing by $200 each month, but the total profit is still increasing due to the compounding effect of the decrease.

The profit in the second month is $800, which is $200 less than the previous month. The profit in the third month is $600, which is $200 less than the previous month, and so on.\n\nWe can represent the total profit as:\n\n$T = 1000 + 800 + 600 + ... + (1000 - 7 \times 200)$\n\nThis is an arithmetic series with a common difference of $-200$. We can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to find the total profit:\n\n$T = \frac{n}{2} \times (a_1 + a_n)$\n\nwhere $n$ is the number of terms, $a_1$ is the first term, and $a_n$ is the last term.\n\nIn this case, $n = 8$, $a_1 = 1000$, and $a_n = 1000 - 7 \times 200 = -400$.\n\nSubstituting these values, we get:\n\n$T = \frac{8}{2} \times (1000 + (-400))$\n\n$T = 4 \times 600$\n\n$T = 2400$\n\nHowever, this is not the correct answer.

new_step_formalans_kwgiven__MIDD_theorem_proving_7th_grade_523,A rectangular garden has a length of 12 units and a width of 7 units. A gardener decides to extend the length of the garden by 5 units and reduce the width by 2 units. What is the new area and perimeter of the garden?,1,1,"104229,3483,104230,3895","# Informal Proof:\n\nTo find the new area and perimeter of the garden, we first need to determine the new dimensions of the garden. The original length of the garden is 12 units, and the original width is 7 units. The gardener decides to extend the length by 5 units, so the new length will be 12 + 5 = 17 units. The gardener also decides to reduce the width by 2 units, so the new width will be 7 - 2 = 5 units.\n\nNow that we have the new dimensions, we can calculate the new area of the garden. The area of a rectangle is given by the formula length × width. So, the new area will be 17 × 5 = 85 square units.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the new perimeter of the garden. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula 2 × (length + width). So, the new perimeter will be 2 × (17 + 5) = 2 × 22 = 44 units.\n\nTherefore, the new area of the garden is 85 square units, and the new perimeter is 44 units.\n\nHowever, the question seems to be related to the context provided earlier, which deals with the greatest area of a quadrilateral with sides in arithmetic sequence. In that case, we can use the formula for the area of a quadrilateral with sides in arithmetic sequence, which is given by $\AA = \sqrt {a b c d}$.\n\nIn this case, we are not given the sides of the quadrilateral, but we are given the original length and width of the garden, which are 12 units and 7 units, respectively. We are also given that the gardener extends the length by 5 units and reduces the width by 2 units, so the new sides of the quadrilateral will be 17 units and 5 units.\n\nHowever, we are not given the common difference between the sides of the quadrilateral. To find the greatest area of the quadrilateral, we need to find the common difference between the sides.\n\nLet's assume that the common difference between the sides is k. Then, the sides of the quadrilateral will be 17, 17 + k, 17 + 2k, and 17 + 3k.\n\nWe are given that the area of the quadrilateral is the greatest possible for one with sides in arithmetic sequence. Using Brahmagupta's Formula, we can find the area of the quadrilateral as $\AA = \sqrt {\paren {s - a} \paren {s - b} \paren {s - c} \paren {s - d} }$, where s is the semiperimeter of the quadrilateral.\n\nThe semiperimeter of the quadrilateral is given by $s = \dfrac {a + b + c + d} 2$. Substituting the values of a, b, c, and d, we get $s = \dfrac {17 + (17 + k) + (17 + 2k) + (17 + 3k)} 2 = 2 a + 3 k$.\n\nSubstituting the value of s into Brahmagupta's Formula, we get $\AA = \sqrt {\paren {2 a + 3 k - 17} \paren {2 a + 3 k - (17 + k)} \paren {2 a + 3 k - (17 + 2k)} \paren {2 a + 3 k - (17 + 3k)} }$.\n\nSimplifying the expression, we get $\AA = \sqrt {a b c d}$.\n\nHowever, we are not given the values of a, b, c, and d. To find the greatest area of the quadrilateral, we need to find the values of a, b, c, and d.\n\nLet's assume that the sides of the quadrilateral are 7, 8, 9, and 10. Then, the area of the quadrilateral will be $\AA = \sqrt {7 \times 8 \times 9 \times 10} = \sqrt {5040} \approx 70.99$ square units.\n\nTherefore, the greatest area of the quadrilateral with sides in arithmetic sequence is approximately 70.99 square units.",```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\n-- Define the original dimensions of the garden\ndef originalLength : ℕ := 12\ndef originalWidth : ℕ := 7\n\n-- Define the changes to the dimensions\ndef lengthChange : ℕ := 5\ndef widthChange : ℕ := 2\n\n-- Calculate the new dimensions\ndef newLength : ℕ := originalLength + lengthChange\ndef newWidth : ℕ := originalWidth - widthChange\n\n-- Calculate the new area\ndef newArea : ℕ := newLength * newWidth\n\n-- Calculate the new perimeter\ndef newPerimeter : ℕ := 2 * (newLength + newWidth)\n\n-- Output the results\n#eval newArea\n#eval newPerimeter\n```,True

The first transformation enlarges the square by 3 times, which means each side length is multiplied by 3. So, the new side length after the first transformation is `3x` inches.\n\nNext, the square undergoes another transformation that reduces its size by half. This means each side length is divided by 2. So, the side length after the second transformation is `(3x) / 2` inches.\n\nWe are given that the final side length is 6 inches. Therefore, we can set up the equation `(3x) / 2 = 6` to represent the situation.\n\nTo solve for `x`, we can start by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction.

The theorem in the context states that `a b = x (a + b)`, where `x` is the length of the side of the inscribed square. However, in our problem, we are dealing with a square that undergoes transformations, and we are solving for the original side length `x`. The key insight here is that the transformations do not change the fact that the side length of the square is multiplied and divided by certain factors.

This test will help us determine if the difference in mean scores between the two groups is statistically significant.\n\nFirst, let's recall the definition of a simple hypothesis test, which is a statistical test used to determine whether there is a significant difference between the means of two groups. In this case, we want to test the null hypothesis (H0) that there is no significant difference between the mean scores of the two groups, against the alternative hypothesis (H1) that there is a significant difference.\n\nThe null hypothesis can be written as:\n\nH0: μ1 = μ2\n\nwhere μ1 and μ2 are the population means of the two groups.\n\nThe alternative hypothesis can be written as:\n\nH1: μ1 ≠ μ2\n\nWe will use the two-sample t-test to test this hypothesis. The two-sample t-test is a statistical test that compares the means of two independent samples to determine if there is a significant difference between them.\n\nTo perform the two-sample t-test, we need to calculate the test statistic (t) and the degrees of freedom (df).

What is the probability that the point lies within a right-angled isosceles triangle inscribed within the circle, where the hypotenuse of the triangle is a diameter of the circle?",0,1,11574,"# Informal Proof:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the circle and the inscribed right-angled isosceles triangle. Let's start by considering the properties of the triangle.\n\nWe know that the hypotenuse of the triangle is a diameter of the circle. This means that the triangle is a right-angled isosceles triangle, with two equal sides and a right angle at the center of the circle.\n\nNow, let's consider the circle with a radius of 1 unit. We can inscribe a right-angled isosceles triangle within the circle, with the hypotenuse as the diameter of the circle. The triangle will have two equal sides, each with a length equal to the radius of the circle (1 unit).\n\nThe key insight here is that the triangle is symmetric about the diameter. This means that the two equal sides of the triangle are also equal to the radius of the circle.\n\nNow, let's consider a point that is randomly selected within the circle. We want to find the probability that the point lies within the inscribed right-angled isosceles triangle.\n\nTo do this, we can use the concept of area. The area of the circle is given by the formula A = πr^2, where r is the radius of the circle. In this case, the radius is 1 unit, so the area of the circle is A = π(1)^2 = π.\n\nThe area of the triangle can be found using the formula A = (1/2)bh, where b is the base of the triangle and h is the height of the triangle. In this case, the base and height of the triangle are both equal to the radius of the circle (1 unit), so the area of the triangle is A = (1/2)(1)(1) = 1/2.\n\nNow, let's consider the ratio of the area of the triangle to the area of the circle. This ratio is given by the formula P = A_triangle / A_circle, where P is the probability that the point lies within the triangle.\n\nSubstituting the values we found earlier, we get P = (1/2) / π.\n\nHowever, we need to consider the fact that the triangle is inscribed within the circle, and the point is randomly selected within the circle. This means that the probability of the point lying within the triangle is actually equal to the ratio of the area of the triangle to the area of the circle, but we need to take into account the fact that the triangle is inscribed within the circle.\n\nTo do this, we can use the concept of similarity. The triangle is similar to the circle, with the hypotenuse as the diameter of the circle.

Since the hypotenuse of the triangle is a diameter of the circle, we can draw a circle with a radius of 1 unit, as given in the problem. The inscribed triangle will have its vertices at the points where the circle intersects the diameter.\n\nNow, let's consider the properties of the circle. A circle is a set of all points in a plane that are equidistant from a central point called the center. In this case, the center of the circle is the midpoint of the diameter, which is also the midpoint of the hypotenuse of the inscribed triangle.\n\nSince the inscribed triangle is a right-angled isosceles triangle, its two legs are equal in length, and the hypotenuse is the diameter of the circle. This means that the triangle is symmetric about the center of the circle.\n\nNow, let's consider the probability of a randomly selected point lying within the inscribed triangle. To do this, we need to understand the area of the triangle and the area of the circle.\n\nThe area of a triangle is given by the formula (base × height) / 2. In this case, the base of the triangle is the diameter of the circle, which is 2 units, and the height of the triangle is also 1 unit (since the triangle is a right-angled isosceles triangle). Therefore, the area of the triangle is (2 × 1) / 2 = 1 square unit.\n\nThe area of a circle is given by the formula πr^2, where r is the radius of the circle. In this case, the radius of the circle is 1 unit, so the area of the circle is π(1)^2 = π square units.\n\nNow, let's consider the probability of a randomly selected point lying within the inscribed triangle. This probability is equal to the ratio of the area of the triangle to the area of the circle. Therefore, the probability is 1 / π.\n\nHowever, this is not the final answer. We need to consider the fact that the inscribed triangle is a right-angled isosceles triangle, and the probability of a randomly selected point lying within the triangle is actually 1/2, since the triangle is symmetric about the center of the circle.\n\nTo see why this is the case, let's consider the following: if we draw a line from the center of the circle to the midpoint of the hypotenuse of the inscribed triangle, we will divide the triangle into two equal parts. Since the triangle is symmetric about the center of the circle, the probability of a randomly selected point lying within the triangle is equal to the probability of a randomly selected point lying within one of the two equal parts. Therefore, the probability is 1/2.\n\nIn conclusion, the probability of a randomly selected point lying within a right-angled isosceles triangle inscribed within a circle, where the hypotenuse of the triangle is a diameter of the circle, is 1/2.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n\n-- Define the theorem statement\ntheorem inscribed_right_angled_triangle_probability :\n  let circle_radius := 1\n  let triangle_area := 1\n  let circle_area := π * circle_radius^2\n  triangle_area / circle_area = 1 / 2 :=\nbegin\n  -- Assign the values\n  let circle_radius := 1,\n  let triangle_area := 1,\n  let circle_area := π * circle_radius^2,\n  -- Simplify the expression\n  simp [circle_radius, triangle_area, circle_area],\n  -- Prove the equality\n  field_simp,\n  ring,\nend\n```",False

This is because even numbers are defined as multiples of $2$.\n\nNow, since $n$ is also a multiple of $4$, we can express it as $n = 4m$ for some integer $m$. This means that $n$ can be divided by $4$ without leaving a remainder.\n\nCombining these two expressions, we get $2k = 4m$. This implies that $k = 2m$, which means that $k$ is also even.\n\nSince $k$ is even, we can express it as $k = 2p$ for some integer $p$. Substituting this into the expression for $n$, we get $n = 2(2p) = 4p$.\n\nThis shows that $n$ can be expressed as a multiple of $4$, which is a multiple of $2$.

The mean of the real parts of those complex numbers is 5 and the mean of the imaginary parts is 3. We are given a sample of 30 complex numbers from this population. Our sample has a mean of the real parts 4.8 and the mean of the imaginary parts is 2.9. The standard deviation of the real parts in our sample is 1 and the standard deviation of the imaginary parts is 0.8. Is this sample significantly different from the population at the 5% level of significance?,2,1,"123409,123407,123407,19279,19280,123401,123401,90487","# Informal Proof:\n\nTo determine if the sample is significantly different from the population at the 5% level of significance, we need to compare the sample statistics with the population parameters. We are given the population means for the real and imaginary parts as 5 and 3, respectively. The sample statistics for the real and imaginary parts are 4.8 and 2.9, respectively.\n\nFirst, let's consider the real parts. We know that the sample mean is 4.8, which is 0.2 units away from the population mean of 5. To determine if this difference is statistically significant, we need to calculate the standard error of the mean (SEM) for the real parts. The SEM is given by the formula SEM = σ / sqrt(n), where σ is the population standard deviation and n is the sample size.\n\nHowever, we are given the sample standard deviation (s) as 1, which is an estimate of the population standard deviation. We can use this estimate to calculate the SEM. The SEM for the real parts is SEM = 1 / sqrt(30) = 0.108.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the z-score, which measures the number of standard errors away from the population mean. The z-score is given by the formula z = (x̄ - μ) / SEM, where x̄ is the sample mean, μ is the population mean, and SEM is the standard error of the mean.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get z = (4.8 - 5) / 0.108 = -0.185. This z-score indicates that the sample mean for the real parts is 0.185 standard errors away from the population mean.\n\nNow, let's consider the imaginary parts. We know that the sample mean is 2.9, which is 0.1 units away from the population mean of 3. To determine if this difference is statistically significant, we need to calculate the SEM for the imaginary parts. The SEM for the imaginary parts is SEM = 0.8 / sqrt(30) = 0.027.\n\nThe z-score for the imaginary parts is z = (2.9 - 3) / 0.027 = -1.852. This z-score indicates that the sample mean for the imaginary parts is 1.852 standard errors away from the population mean.\n\nTo determine if the sample is significantly different from the population at the 5% level of significance, we need to compare the z-scores with the critical z-score for a two-tailed test at the 5% level of significance. The critical z-score is approximately 1.96.\n\nSince the z-score for the real parts (-0.185) is less than the critical z-score (1.96), we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the sample mean for the real parts is equal to the population mean. This means that the sample is not significantly different from the population at the 5% level of significance for the real parts.\n\nHowever, the z-score for the imaginary parts (-1.852) is less than the critical z-score (1.96), we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the sample mean for the imaginary parts is equal to the population mean.

The Laplace transform of a function $f(t)$ is given by:\n\n$$\laptrans f = \int_0^\infty e^{-st}f(t)dt$$\n\nwhere $s$ is a complex number.\n\nNow, let's assume that $f(t)$ is a continuous function on the interval $0 \le t \le A$. We want to show that the Laplace transform of $f(t)$, denoted by $\laptrans f$, is also continuous.\n\nTo do this, we can use the fact that the Laplace transform of a function is equal to the integral of the function multiplied by $e^{-st}$. Since the integral of a continuous function is continuous, we can conclude that the Laplace transform of a continuous function is also continuous.\n\nHowever, we need to be more precise. Let's consider the following:\n\nSuppose we have two functions $f(t)$ and $g(t)$ that are continuous on the interval $0 \le t \le A$.

Then, we can write r as 3m + s, where m is an integer and 0 < s < 3. We can then show that if s is not divisible by 3, then the number 9k + r is not divisible by 3.\n\nSince s is not divisible by 3, we know that s is either 1 or 2.

The derivative of a function f at a point (a, b) in the direction of a unit vector u is given by the directional derivative, which is a measure of the rate of change of the function in that direction.\n\nSince the partial derivatives of f with respect to x and y at point (a, b) are both zero, it means that the function f is not changing in the x and y directions at that point. This suggests that the function f has a stationary point at (a, b), which is a point where the function is neither increasing nor decreasing.\n\nNow, let's consider a small change in the x and y directions, denoted by dx and dy, respectively. We can use the Taylor series expansion of the function f around the point (a, b) to analyze the behavior of the function in a small neighborhood around that point.\n\nThe Taylor series expansion of f around (a, b) is given by:\n\nf(x, y) = f(a, b) + (∂f/∂x)(a, b)(x - a) + (∂f/∂y)(a, b)(y - b) + ...\n\nSince the partial derivatives of f with respect to x and y at point (a, b) are both zero, the first two terms of the Taylor series expansion reduce to:\n\nf(x, y) = f(a, b) + ...\n\nThis shows that the function f is approximately constant in a small neighborhood around the point (a, b). This is a characteristic of a local extremum, where the function has a maximum or minimum value in a small neighborhood around that point.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the function f has a local extremum at the point (a, b), since the function is approximately constant in a small neighborhood around that point.\n\nThis result is similar to the theorem ""Derivative at Maximum or Minimum"" (Theorem 2767), which states that if a function f has a local minimum or local maximum at a point ξ, then the derivative of f at that point is zero.

We can then examine the behavior of the function f at the point (a + Δx, b + Δy).\n\nUsing Taylor's Theorem, we can expand the function f at the point (a + Δx, b + Δy) as follows:\n\nf(a + Δx, b + Δy) = f(a, b) + (∂f/∂x)(a, b)Δx + (∂f/∂y)(a, b)Δy + (1/2)(∂²f/∂x²)(a, b)(Δx)² + (1/2)(∂²f/∂y²)(a, b)(Δy)² + (∂²f/∂x∂y)(a, b)ΔxΔy + R(Δx, Δy)\n\nwhere R(Δx, Δy) is the remainder term.\n\nSince the partial derivatives of f with respect to x and y at point (a, b) are both zero, the first two terms in the expansion are zero. We are left with:\n\nf(a + Δx, b + Δy) = (1/2)(∂²f/∂x²)(a, b)(Δx)² + (1/2)(∂²f/∂y²)(a, b)(Δy)² + (∂²f/∂x∂y)(a, b)ΔxΔy + R(Δx, Δy)\n\nNow, let's consider the behavior of the function f near the point (a, b). If the function has a local extremum at this point, then the function should be increasing or decreasing in the neighborhood of this point.\n\nHowever, the expansion of the function f at the point (a + Δx, b + Δy) shows that the function is quadratic in the variables Δx and Δy. This means that the function is either concave up or concave down in the neighborhood of the point (a, b).\n\nSince the function is quadratic, we can analyze the behavior of the function by examining the sign of the second-order partial derivatives. If the second-order partial derivatives are both positive, then the function is concave up and has a local minimum at the point (a, b).

The garden has a length of 6 meters and a width of 4 meters. The path is 1 meter wide. We can use these dimensions to find the area of the garden and the area of the new structure.\n\nThe area of the garden is simply the product of its length and width, which is 6 meters * 4 meters = 24 square meters.\n\nTo find the area of the new structure, we need to consider the path that surrounds the garden. The path is a parallelogram with a width of 1 meter and a length that is equal to the perimeter of the garden. The perimeter of the garden is 2 * (length + width) = 2 * (6 + 4) = 20 meters.

The garden has a length of 6 meters and a width of 4 meters. The path is 1 meter wide.\n\nWe can visualize the new structure as a rectangle with the garden in the center and the path around it. The length of the new structure is the same as the length of the garden, which is 6 meters. The width of the new structure is the sum of the width of the garden and the width of the path, which is 4 meters + 1 meter + 1 meter = 6 meters.\n\nHowever, this is not the correct way to calculate the width of the new structure. The correct way is to add the width of the path to both the width of the garden and the length of the garden. This is because the path is on both sides of the garden, so we need to add its width to both the width and the length of the garden.\n\nSo, the correct width of the new structure is 4 meters + 1 meter = 5 meters.\n\nNow, let's calculate the area of the new structure. The area of a rectangle is given by the formula length × width. In this case, the length is 6 meters and the width is 5 meters, so the area of the new structure is 6 meters × 5 meters = 30 square meters.\n\nNext, let's calculate the area of the garden.

Since she saves $5 each week, the total amount of money she saved is:\n\n$5/week * 12 weeks = $60\n\nThis is the amount of money she had initially saved to buy the toy worth $60.\n\nNow, she finds a toy on sale for $40. To find out how much money she has left after buying the toy on sale, we need to subtract the cost of the toy from the total amount of money she saved:\n\n$60 (initial savings) - $40 (cost of toy) = $20\n\nSo, Alice has $20 left after buying the toy on sale.\n\nThis solution is similar to the context provided, where the amount spent is equal to half of the initial amount.

The general solution of this ODE can be found using the method of undetermined coefficients or by using the characteristic equation. However, in this case, we are given the initial conditions y(0) = 1 and y'(0) = 0, which will help us find the particular solution.\n\nThe general solution of the ODE y'' - y = 0 is given by y = C1e^x + C2e^(-x), where C1 and C2 are arbitrary constants.

Substituting x = 0 into the general solution, we get y(0) = C1 + C2 = 1. Differentiating the general solution with respect to x, we get y' = C1e^x - C2e^(-x).
