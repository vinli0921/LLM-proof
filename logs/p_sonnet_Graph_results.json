        "informal_proof": "# Informal Proof:\n\nLet me explain how we can prove that a holomorphic function with constant imaginary part must be constant. Here's the intuitive reasoning:\n\nFirst, let's understand what we're given. We have a holomorphic function f defined on an open set \u03a9, and we know that its imaginary part doesn't change - it's constant everywhere in \u03a9.\n\nAny holomorphic function can be written as f(x + iy) = u(x,y) + iv(x,y), where u is the real part and v is the imaginary part. Since we're told that the imaginary part is constant, this means v(x,y) is just some fixed number that doesn't depend on x or y.\n\nNow, here's where the magic of complex analysis comes in. For a function to be holomorphic, it must satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations. These equations tell us that the partial derivatives of u and v are related in a special way:\n\n\u2202u/\u2202x = \u2202v/\u2202y\n\u2202u/\u2202y = -\u2202v/\u2202x\n\nBut since v is constant, both of its partial derivatives are zero. Therefore, by the Cauchy-Riemann equations, both partial derivatives of u must also be zero:\n\n\u2202u/\u2202x = 0 and \u2202u/\u2202y = 0\n\nWhen both partial derivatives of a function are zero everywhere in an open set, that function must be constant - it can't change as we move in any direction. This means that u(x,y) is also constant.\n\nFinally, since both the real part (u) and imaginary part (v) of f are constant, f itself must be constant - it's just some fixed complex number throughout its domain.\n\nThe key insight is that the rigidity of holomorphic functions (expressed through the Cauchy-Riemann equations) forces the real part to be constant when the imaginary part is constant, making the entire function constant.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ':='; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

Dirichlet's test for series convergence\n2. The behavior of the sequence 1/n\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1) First, for any point z on the unit circle (|z| = 1), we can write z = e^(i\u03b8) for some real \u03b8.\n\n2) When z = 1 (\u03b8 = 0), the series becomes the harmonic series \u22111/n, which we know diverges. This explains why z = 1 is excluded.\n\n3) For any other point on the unit circle (z \u2260 1), we can write our series as:\n   \u2211(e^(in\u03b8))/n\n\n4) Now we can apply Dirichlet's test, which states that if:\n   - {a\u2099} is a decreasing sequence converging to 0\n   - The partial sums of {b\u2099} are bounded\n   Then \u2211a\u2099b\u2099 converges\n\n5) In our case:\n   - Let a\u2099 = 1/n (which is decreasing and converges to 0)\n   - Let b\u2099 = e^(in\u03b8) = cos(n\u03b8) + i\u00b7sin(n\u03b8)\n\n6) For any \u03b8 \u2260 0 (mod 2\u03c0), the partial sums of e^(in\u03b8) are bounded because:\n   |\u2211(e^(in\u03b8))| = |1 - e^(i(n+1)\u03b8))/(1 - e^(i\u03b8))| \u2264 2/|1 - e^(i\u03b8)|\n\n7) Therefore, by Dirichlet's test, the series converges for all points on the unit circle except z = 1.\n\nThe convergence is not absolute (since |z| = 1 means the terms don't decrease in absolute value), but it is conditional convergence, which is sufficient to prove the statement.\n\nThis proof shows that while the series fails to converge at z = 1 due to the harmonic series, it converges everywhere else on the unit circle due to the oscillatory behavior of complex exponentials combined with the decreasing factor of 1/n.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

Here's how we can prove this:\n\n1) First, let's consider what happens when we make a substitution p > 0:\n   - If we substitute t = px in the integral, we get:\n   - \u222b(0 to \u221e) sin(px)/x dx = \u222b(0 to \u221e) sin(t)/(t/p) dt = \u222b(0 to \u221e) sin(t)/t dt\n\n2) This shows us something important:\n   - The value of the integral doesn't depend on p (as long as p > 0)\n   - In other words, \u222b(0 to \u221e) sin(px)/x dx = \u222b(0 to \u221e) sin(x)/x dx for any p > 0\n\n3) We can also observe that:\n   - When p = 0, the integral equals 0 (since sin(0) = 0)\n   - When p < 0, the integral equals -\u222b(0 to \u221e) sin(|p|x)/x dx\n     (because sine is an odd function)\n\n4) The Dirichlet integral tells us directly that:\n   \u222b(0 to \u221e) sin(x)/x dx = \u03c0/2\n\n5) Therefore:\n   - For p > 0: \u222b(0 to \u221e) sin(px)/x dx = \u03c0/2\n   - For p = 0: \u222b(0 to \u221e) sin(px)/x dx = 0\n   - For p < 0: \u222b(0 to \u221e) sin(px)/x dx = -\u03c0/2\n\nThis proof shows that not only does our integral equal \u03c0/2, but it's part of a broader family of integrals that all evaluate to the same value (up to sign) when scaled by a positive constant. The result follows from the scale invariance property of the integral combined with the known value of the Dirichlet integral.\n\nThe beauty of this proof lies in how it uses simple substitution to reveal a deeper property - that the integral is invariant under positive scaling - before using the Dirichlet integral to establish its actual value.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unexpected end of input\nPlease revise the proof.",

Since A and B are disjoint, this distance must be positive for each point in A. Similarly, for any point b in B, its distance to set A must be positive.\n\nFor each point x in A, we can define an open ball around it with radius equal to half its distance to B. Let's call the union of all these open balls U. Similarly, for each point in B, we can define an open ball with radius half its distance to A, and call their union V.\n\nNow, U contains A and V contains B because each point in A and B is the center of one of our balls. Also, U and V are open by construction since they're unions of open balls.\n\nThe crucial part is showing U and V don't intersect. If they did intersect, there would be some point z that's both within half the distance to A of some point in B, and within half the distance to B of some point in A. But this would create a path between A and B that's shorter than the distance between them, which is impossible.\n\nTherefore, U and V are disjoint open sets containing A and B respectively, which is exactly what we needed to show that A and B are separated.\n\nThis proof works because we're in a metric space where distances are well-defined and satisfy the triangle inequality.

Then in our cover B(1/n), there must be some ball that contains x and is contained in B(x,r), and thus in U.\n\n9) This shows that any open set can be written as a union of balls from our collection B, making B a base for the topology.\n\nTherefore, we have constructed a countable base for K, proving that every compact metric space has a countable base.\n\nThe key insight is that compactness allows us to work with finite covers at each radius, and taking a countable union of these finite covers gives us our countable base.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'ball'\nunknown identifier 'ball'\nfailed to synthesize\n  HAdd \u2191B \u2115 \u2115\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  HAdd \u2191B \u2115 \u2115\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, equality or iff proof expected\n  True\nK : Type u_1\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : MetricSpace K\ninst\u271d : CompactSpace K\nB : Set (Set K) := {U | \u2203 n, U = sorryAx (Set K) true}\nm n : \u2191B\nh : True\n\u22a2 1 / (m + 1) = 1 / (n + 1)\nfailed to synthesize\n  HAdd \u2191B \u2115 ?m.40397\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  HAdd \u2191B \u2115 ?m.40397\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nunknown identifier 'isOpen_ball'\nunknown identifier 'isOpen_iff_exists_ball_subset'\nrcases tactic failed: x\u271d : ?m.41091 is not an inductive datatype\nPlease revise the proof.",

Suppose E\\P is uncountable.\n\n3) From the given context about condensation points (from theorem 45404), we know that if a set is countable, it cannot have any condensation points.

We can do this by:\n   - Looking left from p until we hit the boundary of O or continue forever\n   - Looking right from p until we hit the boundary of O or continue forever\n\n3) These maximal intervals have an important property: if two such intervals overlap at all, they must actually be the same interval.

This is a difference of two terms that both grow large, so we need to manipulate it to see its true behavior.\n\n2) We can rationalize this by multiplying both numerator and denominator by \u221a(n\u00b2 + n) + n:\n   (\u221a(n\u00b2 + n) - n)(\u221a(n\u00b2 + n) + n)/(\u221a(n\u00b2 + n) + n)\n\n3) The numerator simplifies to (n\u00b2 + n) - n\u00b2 = n, because when we multiply (\u221a(n\u00b2 + n) - n)(\u221a(n\u00b2 + n) + n), we get (n\u00b2 + n) - n\u00b2.\n\n4) The denominator is \u221a(n\u00b2 + n) + n\n\n5) So our expression becomes n/(\u221a(n\u00b2 + n) + n)\n\n6) As n approaches infinity, both numerator and denominator grow large, but we can see that:\n   - The numerator is growing linearly (order n)\n   - The denominator is growing slightly faster than linearly (order n + small term)\n\n7) When we divide n by (\u221a(n\u00b2 + n) + n), we get 1/2 in the limit because:\n   - \u221a(n\u00b2 + n) = n\u221a(1 + 1/n)\n   - As n \u2192 \u221e, \u221a(1 + 1/n) \u2192 1\n   - So the denominator approaches 2n\n   - Therefore n/(2n) = 1/2\n\nThis shows that the limit must equal 1/2.\n\nThe key to this proof was recognizing that we needed to rationalize the expression to transform it into a form where we could analyze the growth rates of numerator and denominator separately.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'tendsto_nhds_of_metric'\nPlease revise the proof.",

Here's the intuitive reasoning:\n\n1) First, let's understand what limsup means intuitively. For a sequence, limsup is the largest value that the sequence approaches infinitely often. It's the supremum of all limit points of the sequence.\n\n2) For any \u03b5 > 0, we know that eventually, almost all terms of sequence {a\u2099} will be less than limsup a\u2099 + \u03b5/2, except possibly finitely many terms. The same applies for {b\u2099} with limsup b\u2099 + \u03b5/2.\n\n3) When we add these sequences, for large enough n, most terms of (a\u2099 + b\u2099) will be less than (limsup a\u2099 + \u03b5/2) + (limsup b\u2099 + \u03b5/2) = limsup a\u2099 + limsup b\u2099 + \u03b5.\n\n4) Since this is true for any \u03b5 > 0, and limsup of (a\u2099 + b\u2099) can't be larger than what the sum of sequences approaches infinitely often, we must have:\n   limsup(a\u2099 + b\u2099) \u2264 limsup a\u2099 + limsup b\u2099\n\n5) The condition about \"not of the form \u221e-\u221e\" is important because it ensures our inequality makes sense. If one sequence tends to infinity and another to negative infinity, we can't make meaningful conclusions about their sum.\n\nThe key insight is that while individual terms in each sequence might occasionally exceed their respective limsups, when we add the sequences, we can't consistently get values larger than the sum of the individual limsups. This is because such large values would have to occur infinitely often in both sequences simultaneously, which contradicts the definition of limsup.\n\nThis proof relies on the fundamental properties of suprema (as seen in the context about suprema of indexed families) and extends them to the limiting behavior of sequences.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

Here's the intuitive reasoning:\n\nThe key idea is that if two continuous functions agree on a dense set, they can't \"split apart\" anywhere else because:\n1. Dense sets have points arbitrarily close to every point in the space\n2. Continuous functions preserve limits of sequences/nets\n3. Metric spaces are Hausdorff, so limits are unique\n\nHere's the detailed informal reasoning:\n\nTake any point x in X that's not necessarily in the dense set E. Since E is dense in X, we can find a sequence of points from E that gets arbitrarily close to x. Let's call these points e\u2081, e\u2082, e\u2083, ... all from set E.\n\nWe know that f and g agree on all these points from E, so:\nf(e\u2081) = g(e\u2081), f(e\u2082) = g(e\u2082), and so on...\n\nNow, since f is continuous, as our sequence e\u2081, e\u2082, e\u2083, ... approaches x, the sequence f(e\u2081), f(e\u2082), f(e\u2083), ... must approach f(x).\n\nSimilarly, since g is continuous, as the same sequence e\u2081, e\u2082, e\u2083, ... approaches x, the sequence g(e\u2081), g(e\u2082), g(e\u2083), ... must approach g(x).\n\nBut notice: these are the same sequence! Since f(e\u2099) = g(e\u2099) for all n, we're actually looking at a single sequence in Y that must approach both f(x) and g(x).\n\nSince Y is a metric space, it's Hausdorff, which means limits are unique. Therefore, f(x) and g(x) must be equal.\n\nSince x was arbitrary, this shows f and g must agree everywhere on X.\n\nThe key insight is that continuity forces functions to behave predictably near every point, and density ensures we have enough information about how the functions behave to pin down their values everywhere.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

This function is continuous on its domain E. I'll show that this function cannot be extended to a continuous function on all of \u211d.\n\nThe key idea is that any potential continuous extension would need to define a value at x = 0, but no such value can make the function continuous there.

Here's the intuitive reasoning:\n\n1) First, let's understand what we're given:\n   - We have a uniformly continuous function f from metric space X to metric space Y\n   - We have a Cauchy sequence {x\u2099} in X\n   - We need to show that {f(x\u2099)} is Cauchy in Y\n\n2) The key insight is that uniform continuity gives us precise control over the distances between output points based on the distances between input points. Specifically, for any small \u03b5 > 0, we can find a \u03b4 > 0 such that if two points in X are closer than \u03b4, their images under f must be closer than \u03b5.\n\n3) Since {x\u2099} is Cauchy in X, for this \u03b4 we can find some N such that for all m,n \u2265 N:\n   d(x\u2098, x\u2099) < \u03b4\n\n4) Now, by uniform continuity, this means that for these same m,n \u2265 N:\n   \u03c1(f(x\u2098), f(x\u2099)) < \u03b5\n   (where \u03c1 is the metric in Y)\n\n5) This is exactly what we need to show that {f(x\u2099)} is Cauchy in Y! For any \u03b5 > 0, we've found an N where all terms past the Nth term are within \u03b5 of each other.\n\nThe key to this proof is seeing how uniform continuity bridges the gap between the Cauchy property in the domain and codomain. Regular continuity wouldn't be strong enough because we need the same \u03b4 to work for all points in the sequence, not just around a single point.\n\nThis proof shows that uniform continuity is strong enough to preserve the convergence behavior of Cauchy sequences, which is a fundamental property that makes uniform continuity particularly useful in analysis.\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  UniformContinuous.comp hf hx\nargument\n  hx\nhas type\n  CauchySeq x : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  UniformContinuous ?m.1287 : Prop\nPlease revise the proof.",

The key insight is to combine the properties of openness and continuity.\n\nFirst, let's understand what we're trying to prove by contradiction. Suppose f is not monotonic. This means there exist three points x < y < z where either:\n1) f(x) < f(y) and f(y) > f(z), or \n2) f(x) > f(y) and f(y) < f(z)\n\nLet's focus on case 1 (case 2 would follow similar logic). In this case, f increases from x to y and then decreases from y to z.\n\nHere's why this leads to a contradiction:\n\nSince f is an open mapping, it maps open intervals to open intervals. Consider the open interval (x,z). The image of this interval under f must be an open set.\n\nHowever, f(y) is a maximum value in the image of (x,z). This means there exists some neighborhood around f(y) where points above f(y) are not in the image of (x,z). Therefore, the image cannot be an open set.\n\nWhy? Because in an open set, every point must have a full neighborhood contained in the set. But f(y) doesn't have a full neighborhood in the image - only points below f(y) are in the image locally.\n\nThis contradicts our assumption that f is an open mapping.\n\nThe same contradiction arises if we assume case 2 where f has a local minimum at y.\n\nTherefore, f cannot have any local extrema except possibly at the endpoints of intervals. This means f must be strictly monotonic (either increasing or decreasing) over its entire domain.\n\nThe key insight is that openness requires the image of any open interval to be open, which is incompatible with having local extrema inside the domain.

This measures how far p is from its closest point in F.\n\n2) Since K and F are disjoint, and F is closed, for any point p in K, the distance d(p,F) must be positive. This is because if d(p,F) were zero, p would have to be either in F or a limit point of F, but F contains all its limit points since it's closed.\n\n3) Now consider the function f that maps each point p in K to its distance from F: f(p) = d(p,F). This function has two important properties:\n   - It's continuous (this is a known property of distance functions)\n   - It only takes positive values (from step 2)\n\n4) Since K is compact and f is continuous, f must attain a minimum value on K (this is a fundamental property of continuous functions on compact sets). Let's call this minimum value \u03b4.\n\n5) Since f only takes positive values, \u03b4 must be positive.\n\n6) This \u03b4 is exactly what we're looking for: for any point p in K and q in F, d(p,q) must be at least \u03b4. This is because d(p,q) can't be less than the distance from p to the entire set F.\n\nTherefore, we've found a positive number \u03b4 that serves as a lower bound for the distance between any point in K and any point in F, which is what we needed to prove.\n\nThe compactness of K is crucial here - it's what guarantees we can find a minimum distance rather than just having distances that get arbitrarily close to zero.

This is exactly the type of situation where L'H\u00f4pital's Rule is applicable.\n\n2) The key insight is that we can use the fact that f(x)=g(x)=0 to set up a scenario similar to the Cauchy Mean Value Theorem. When we look at the ratio f(t)/g(t) as t approaches x, we're essentially looking at how these functions grow relative to each other near x.\n\n3) For any point t close to but not equal to x, we can apply the Cauchy Mean Value Theorem to the interval between x and t. This theorem tells us that there must be some point \u03be between x and t where the ratio of derivatives f'(\u03be)/g'(\u03be) equals the ratio of the function values f(t)/g(t).\n\n4) As t gets closer to x, this intermediate point \u03be also gets closer to x.

We need to show that in a group where all subgroups are normal, for any two elements a and b, their product ba can be written as a^j b for some integer j.\n\n2) Let's consider the element a \u2208 G.

Here's why:\n   - By Sylow's theorems, all Sylow p-subgroups have order p^n\n   - In an abelian group, Sylow p-subgroups are unique\n   - Therefore, H must be THE Sylow p-subgroup of G\n\n3) Now, let's think about what happens under any automorphism \u03c6 of G:\n   - Automorphisms preserve order of elements\n   - Therefore, they map Sylow p-subgroups to Sylow p-subgroups\n   - Since H is the unique Sylow p-subgroup, \u03c6(H) must equal H\n\n4) The reasoning flows like this:\n   - If \u03c6 is any automorphism of G\n   - \u03c6(H) must be a subgroup of order p^n (automorphisms preserve order)\n   - But H is the unique subgroup of order p^n\n   - Therefore \u03c6(H) = H\n\n5) This is exactly what it means for H to be characteristic:\n   - Every automorphism of G maps H to itself\n   - Therefore H is characteristic in G\n\nThe key to this proof is recognizing that the uniqueness of Sylow p-subgroups in abelian groups, combined with the order conditions given, forces any automorphism to preserve H.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown constant 'Subgroup.is_characteristic_of_prime_of_unique_of_order_eq'\nPlease revise the proof.",

This is a crucial observation because groups of prime power order have special properties.\n\nFor a group G of order 9, we can use Sylow's theorems to understand its structure. In particular, since 9 = 3\u00b2, the group must have a Sylow 3-subgroup (a subgroup of order 9), which is actually the entire group itself.\n\nNow, any p-group (a group whose order is a power of a prime p) has a non-trivial center. This means that the center of our group G cannot be trivial - it must have order either 3 or 9.\n\nIf the center has order 9, then the entire group is its own center, which by definition means the group is abelian, and we're done.\n\nIf the center has order 3, then the quotient group G/Z(G) would have order 3. However, this would mean G/Z(G) is cyclic (since 3 is prime). A fundamental theorem of group theory states that if G/Z(G) is cyclic, then G must be abelian.\n\nTherefore, in either case, G must be abelian.\n\nThis proof shows that there's no way to construct a non-abelian group of order 9, as any such group would necessarily be abelian due to its structure as a p-group and the properties of its center.\nPrevious attempt failed with: expected ';' or line break\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

For any x, y \u2208 S:\n   - \u03c6(xy) must equal (xy)^(-1) = y^(-1)x^(-1)\n   - But also, since \u03c6 is a homomorphism, \u03c6(xy) = \u03c6(x)\u03c6(y) = x^(-1)y^(-1)\n\n3) For elements in S, these must be equal:\n   y^(-1)x^(-1) = x^(-1)y^(-1)\n   This means elements in S commute with each other.\n\n4) Now comes the crucial counting argument:\n   - Let |G| be the size of G\n   - |S| > (3/4)|G| by given condition\n   - For any two elements a,b \u2208 S, their product ab must also satisfy \u03c6(ab) = (ab)^(-1)\n   - Otherwise, we would have a contradiction with the homomorphism property\n\n5) By the size condition:\n   - If we take any element y \u2208 G\n   - More than half of the elements in S will have their product with y also in S\n   - This forces y to be in S (otherwise we'd violate the homomorphism property)\n\n6) Therefore:\n   - S must actually be all of G\n   - All elements satisfy \u03c6(x) = x^(-1)\n   - Since all elements commute (as shown in step 3), G is abelian\n\nThe key to this proof is combining the counting argument with the homomorphism property to show that the set S must actually be the entire group, and then using this to establish that G is abelian.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown constant 'Finset.mem_or_mem_of_mem_union'\ntype mismatch\n  h2\nhas type\n  x \u2209 I : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  x \u2208 I : Prop\ntype mismatch\n  h4\nhas type\n  \u03c6 x = x\u207b\u00b9 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u03c6 x = x : Prop\ntype mismatch\n  h3\nhas type\n  \u03c6 x = x : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u03c6 x = x\u207b\u00b9 : Prop\ntactic 'apply' failed, failed to unify\n  (@HMul.hMul ?\u03b1 ?\u03b1 ?\u03b1\n        (@instHMul ?\u03b1\n          (@MulOneClass.toMul ?\u03b1 (@Monoid.toMulOneClass ?\u03b1 (@DivInvMonoid.toMonoid ?\u03b1 DivisionMonoid.toDivInvMonoid))))\n        ?a ?b)\u207b\u00b9 =\n    ?a\u207b\u00b9 * ?b\u207b\u00b9\nwith\n  (@HMul.hMul G G G\n        (@instHMul G (@MulOneClass.toMul G (@Monoid.toMulOneClass G (@DivInvMonoid.toMonoid G Group.toDivInvMonoid)))) x\n        y)\u207b\u00b9 =\n    x\u207b\u00b9 * y\u207b\u00b9\nG : Type u_1\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : Group G\ninst\u271d : Fintype G\n\u03c6 : G \u2243* G\nI : Finset G\nhI : \u2200 x \u2208 I, \u03c6 x = x\u207b\u00b9\nhI1 : 0.75 * \u2191(card G) \u2264 \u2191(card { x // x \u2208 I })\nh1 : \u2200 (x : G), \u03c6 x = x\u207b\u00b9\nx y : G\nh3 : \u03c6 (x * y) = (x * y)\u207b\u00b9\nh4 : \u03c6 (x * y) = \u03c6 x * \u03c6 y\n\u22a2 (x * y)\u207b\u00b9 = x\u207b\u00b9 * y\u207b\u00b9\ntactic 'apply' failed, failed to unify\n  @HMul.hMul ?G ?G ?G (@instHMul ?G CommMagma.toMul) ?a ?b = ?b * ?a\nwith\n  @HMul.hMul G G G (@instHMul G MulOneClass.toMul) x\u207b\u00b9 y\u207b\u00b9 = y\u207b\u00b9 * x\u207b\u00b9\nG : Type u_1\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : Group G\ninst\u271d : Fintype G\n\u03c6 : G \u2243* G\nI : Finset G\nhI : \u2200 x \u2208 I, \u03c6 x = x\u207b\u00b9\nhI1 : 0.75 * \u2191(card G) \u2264 \u2191(card { x // x \u2208 I })\nh1 : \u2200 (x : G), \u03c6 x = x\u207b\u00b9\nx y : G\nh3 : \u03c6 (x * y) = (x * y)\u207b\u00b9\nh4 : \u03c6 (x * y) = \u03c6 x * \u03c6 y\nh5 : (x * y)\u207b\u00b9 = x\u207b\u00b9 * y\u207b\u00b9\nh6 : \u03c6 x * \u03c6 y = x\u207b\u00b9 * y\u207b\u00b9\n\u22a2 x\u207b\u00b9 * y\u207b\u00b9 = y\u207b\u00b9 * x\u207b\u00b9\ntactic 'apply' failed, failed to unify\n  (@HMul.hMul ?\u03b1 ?\u03b1 ?\u03b1\n        (@instHMul ?\u03b1\n          (@MulOneClass.toMul ?\u03b1 (@Monoid.toMulOneClass ?\u03b1 (@DivInvMonoid.toMonoid ?\u03b1 DivisionMonoid.toDivInvMonoid))))\n        ?a ?b)\u207b\u00b9 =\n    ?a\u207b\u00b9 * ?b\u207b\u00b9\nwith\n  (@HMul.hMul G G G\n        (@instHMul G (@MulOneClass.toMul G (@Monoid.toMulOneClass G (@DivInvMonoid.toMonoid G Group.toDivInvMonoid)))) x\n        y)\u207b\u00b9 =\n    y\u207b\u00b9 * x\u207b\u00b9\nG : Type u_1\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : Group G\ninst\u271d : Fintype G\n\u03c6 : G \u2243* G\nI : Finset G\nhI : \u2200 x \u2208 I, \u03c6 x = x\u207b\u00b9\nhI1 : 0.75 * \u2191(card G) \u2264 \u2191(card { x // x \u2208 I })\nh1 : \u2200 (x : G), \u03c6 x = x\u207b\u00b9\nx y : G\nh3 : \u03c6 (x * y) = (x * y)\u207b\u00b9\nh4 : \u03c6 (x * y) = \u03c6 x * \u03c6 y\nh5 : (x * y)\u207b\u00b9 = x\u207b\u00b9 * y\u207b\u00b9\nh6 : \u03c6 x * \u03c6 y = x\u207b\u00b9 * y\u207b\u00b9\nh7 : x\u207b\u00b9 * y\u207b\u00b9 = y\u207b\u00b9 * x\u207b\u00b9\nh8 : \u03c6 (x * y) = y\u207b\u00b9 * x\u207b\u00b9\n\u22a2 (x * y)\u207b\u00b9 = y\u207b\u00b9 * x\u207b\u00b9\ntype mismatch\n  h10\nhas type\n  \u03c6 (x * y) = (x * y)\u207b\u00b9 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  x * y = y * x : Prop\ninvalid constructor \u27e8...\u27e9, expected type must be an inductive type \n  \u2200 (x : G), \u03c6 x = x\u207b\u00b9 \u2227 \u2200 (x y : G), x * y = y * x\nPlease revise the proof.",

Any element in this intersection would have to be both in A and in \u27e8b\u27e9.\n\n2) Since b has prime order p, we know that \u27e8b\u27e9 consists exactly of the elements {e, b, b\u00b2, ..., b^(p-1)}, and these are all distinct (except for b^p = e).\n\n3) If A \u2229 \u27e8b\u27e9 contained any element other than e, it would contain some power of b, let's call it b^k where 1 \u2264 k < p.\n\n4) Since p is prime and k < p, k and p are coprime. This means there exist integers x and y such that kx + py = 1 (by B\u00e9zout's identity).\n\n5) Therefore, b = b^(kx + py) = (b^k)^x * (b^p)^y = (b^k)^x * e^y = (b^k)^x\n\n6) But if b^k is in A (from step 3), and A is normal, then (b^k)^x must also be in A (as A is closed under powers).\n\n7) This would mean b is in A (from step 5), which contradicts our assumption that b \u2209 A.\n\n8) Therefore, our assumption in step 3 must be false, and A \u2229 \u27e8b\u27e9 can only contain the identity element.\n\nThis proof relies on the key properties that:\n- The order of b is prime\n- A is normal\n- b is not in A\n- In a cyclic group of prime order, every non-identity element generates the whole group\n\nThe contradiction shows that the only possible intersection is {e}.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  ?m.1343 \u2208 Subgroup.closure ?m.1342\ncase a.intro\nG : Type u_1\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : Group G\nA : Subgroup G\ninst\u271d : A.Normal\nb : G\nhp : (orderOf b).Prime\nx : G\nhxA : x \u2208 A\nhx : \u2200 (K : Subgroup G), {b} \u2286 \u2191K \u2192 x \u2208 K\n\u22a2 x = 1\nsimp made no progress\nPlease revise the proof.",

A number a is a quadratic residue modulo p if there exists some x such that x\u00b2 \u2261 a (mod p). In other words, it's a number that can be expressed as a perfect square modulo p.\n\nThe key insight is to look at all possible squares modulo p:\n1\u00b2, 2\u00b2, 3\u00b2, ..., ((p-1)/2)\u00b2, ..., (p-1)\u00b2\n\nHere's why this approach works:\n\n1) First, we can observe that for any number r between 1 and p-1, r\u00b2 \u2261 (-r)\u00b2 (mod p). This means that r and p-r (its negative modulo p) give the same quadratic residue.\n\n2) This pairs up our numbers: 1\u00b2 \u2261 (p-1)\u00b2, 2\u00b2 \u2261 (p-2)\u00b2, and so on, until we reach ((p-1)/2)\u00b2 \u2261 ((p+1)/2)\u00b2.\n\n3) These (p-1)/2 squares are all the possible distinct quadratic residues because:\n   - None of them can be congruent to 0 modulo p (since we're only squaring numbers from 1 to p-1)\n   - No two squares in the range 1\u00b2 to ((p-1)/2)\u00b2 can give the same residue modulo p. If r\u00b2 \u2261 s\u00b2 (mod p) for 1 \u2264 r,s \u2264 (p-1)/2, then p must divide (r+s)(r-s). Since r and s are too small for p to divide their sum, p must divide their difference, meaning r = s.\n\n4) Therefore, we have exactly (p-1)/2 distinct quadratic residues modulo p.\n\n5) Since there are p-1 non-zero numbers modulo p total, and we've shown (p-1)/2 of them are quadratic residues, the remaining (p-1)/2 numbers must be quadratic non-residues.\n\nThis gives us a perfect split: (p-1)/2 quadratic residues and (p-1)/2 quadratic non-residues, which is what we wanted to prove.\nPrevious attempt failed with: \nPlease revise the proof.",

Since U is open, it is a neighborhood of x. By the definition of a neighborhood, there exists an open set containing x that is contained in U. This means we can find an open set V containing x such that all points in V are in U. Therefore, V contains no points from the complement of U. This means x cannot be a limit point of the complement of U, since we found an open set containing x (namely V) that contains no points of the complement.\n\nNow for the reverse direction: let's prove that if none of the points in U are limit points of its complement, then U is open.\n\nLet's prove this by contradiction. Suppose U is not open. Then there must be at least one point x in U such that every open neighborhood of x contains points from outside U (i.e., points from the complement of U). But this is exactly what it means for x to be a limit point of the complement of U! This contradicts our assumption that no points in U are limit points of its complement.\n\nTherefore, U must be open.\n\nThe key insight here is that being a limit point of a set A means every open neighborhood of that point contains points from A. By considering the complement of U, we're essentially showing that points in an open set must be \"isolated\" from the complement in the sense that we can find an open neighborhood around them that doesn't touch the complement.\n\nThis proof shows how the concept of openness and the concept of limit points are deeply connected - they're really just two different ways of describing the same topological property.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown constant 'Filter.mem_closure_iff_clusterPt'\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, equality or iff proof expected\n  ?m.570\ncase mp\nM : Type u_1\ninst\u271d : TopologicalSpace M\nU : Set M\nhU : IsOpen U\nx : M\nhx : x \u2208 U\n\u22a2 \u00ac(\ud835\udcdd x \u2293 \ud835\udcdf U\u1d9c).NeBot\nunknown constant 'Filter.mem_closure_iff_clusterPt'\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, equality or iff proof expected\n  ?m.1343\ncase mpr\nM : Type u_1\ninst\u271d : TopologicalSpace M\nU : Set M\nx : M\nhx : x \u2208 U\nh : \u00ac(\ud835\udcdd x \u2293 \ud835\udcdf U\u1d9c).NeBot\n\u22a2 U \u2208 \ud835\udcdd x\nPlease revise the proof.",

This function measures the distance between any pair of points from A and B.\n\n2) We know that A and B are compact and disjoint. From the context theorems, this means they are both closed and their distance is positive (there's a positive gap between them).\n\n3) The function f(a,b) = d(a,b) is continuous in both variables. This follows from the properties of metric spaces and the triangle inequality (we can see this from the context theorem about distance functions being continuous).\n\n4) Now, A \u00d7 B (the Cartesian product of A and B) is also compact because:\n   - A and B are compact\n   - The Cartesian product of compact sets is compact\n\n5) By a fundamental property of continuous functions on compact sets (which we see used in the context), a continuous function on a compact set must attain its minimum value.\n\n6) Therefore, the function f(a,b) = d(a,b) must attain its minimum value somewhere on A \u00d7 B. In other words, there must exist points a\u2080 \u2208 A and b\u2080 \u2208 B such that:\n   d(a\u2080,b\u2080) \u2264 d(a,b) for all a \u2208 A and b \u2208 B\n\n7) These points a\u2080 and b\u2080 are precisely the points we're looking for in the theorem statement.\n\nThe key to this proof is recognizing that we can use the continuity of the distance function and the compactness of the product space to guarantee the existence of points that achieve the minimum distance.

Then V\u2096 must be empty (because any point in V\u2096 would have to be in all previous sets, contradicting that we have a cover).\n\n7) But this contradicts our initial assumption that all sets in the sequence are nonempty.\n\nTherefore, our assumption that the intersection was empty must be wrong. The intersection must contain at least one point.\n\nThis proof works because compactness gives us the crucial finite subcover property, which creates a contradiction with the nested and nonempty properties of our sequence.\nPrevious attempt failed with: function expected at\n  h\nterm has type\n  \u22c2 i, s i = \u2205\nrcases tactic failed: x\u271d : ?m.1025 is not an inductive datatype\ntype mismatch\n  h'\nhas type\n  \u2200 (x : \u03b1), \u2203 i, x \u2208 s i : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  False : Prop\nPlease revise the proof.",

This is a very strong condition that will force the function to be constant.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1) First, let's consider any two points x and y in R. We want to show f(x) = f(y).\n\n2) For any point t between x and y, we can apply our inequality twice:\n   - |f(t)-f(x)| \u2264 |t-x|\u00b2\n   - |f(t)-f(y)| \u2264 |t-y|\u00b2\n\n3) By the triangle inequality:\n   |f(y)-f(x)| \u2264 |f(y)-f(t)| + |f(t)-f(x)| \u2264 |t-y|\u00b2 + |t-x|\u00b2\n\n4) Now comes the clever part: we can choose t to be any point between x and y. If we choose t to be the midpoint of x and y, then:\n   |t-x| = |t-y| = |y-x|/2\n\n5) Substituting this into our inequality:\n   |f(y)-f(x)| \u2264 (|y-x|/2)\u00b2 + (|y-x|/2)\u00b2 = |y-x|\u00b2/2\n\n6) But we can repeat this process! Each time we apply this reasoning, we can show that:\n   |f(y)-f(x)| \u2264 (|y-x|\u00b2)/2^n for any positive integer n\n\n7) As n approaches infinity, the right side approaches 0, meaning:\n   |f(y)-f(x)| = 0\n\n8) Therefore, f(x) = f(y) for any two points x and y in R, which is the definition of a constant function.\n\nThe key to this proof is recognizing that the quadratic bound |t-x|\u00b2 is so strong that when we repeatedly apply it using midpoints, we can make the difference between any two function values arbitrarily small, forcing them to be equal.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

This means that for any s,t in [a,b], we have |f(s) - f(t)| \u2264 \u03bc(|s - t|). Since \u03bc is continuous and \u03bc(s) \u2192 0 as s \u2192 0, for any \u03b5 > 0, we can find a \u03b4 > 0 such that \u03bc(s) < \u03b5 whenever s < \u03b4. Therefore, when |s - t| < \u03b4, we have |f(s) - f(t)| \u2264 \u03bc(|s - t|) < \u03b5. This is exactly the definition of uniform continuity.\n\nNow for the reverse direction - proving that if f is uniformly continuous, then it has a modulus of continuity:\n\nIf f is uniformly continuous on [a,b], we can construct a modulus of continuity \u03bc as follows. For each positive s, define \u03bc(s) as the supremum of |f(x) - f(y)| over all pairs x,y in [a,b] with |x - y| \u2264 s. This function \u03bc has the required properties:\n\n1) It's strictly increasing because larger distances between points can lead to larger differences in function values.\n\n2) It's continuous because uniform continuity of f ensures that small changes in s result in small changes in \u03bc(s).\n\n3) \u03bc(s) \u2192 0 as s \u2192 0 because of the uniform continuity of f.\n\n4) By construction, |f(s) - f(t)| \u2264 \u03bc(|s - t|) for all s,t in [a,b].\n\nThe key insight is that uniform continuity gives us control over the function's variation that depends only on the distance between points, not on their specific location.

First, let's start with ab and see how we can transform it to get to ba.\n\n2. We can multiply ab on the left by a^{-1} and on the right by a. Since we're multiplying by a and its inverse, this is like multiplying by 1, so it doesn't change the overall equality:\n   a^{-1}(ab)a\n\n3.

Z(G) \u00d7 Z(H) is contained in Z(G \u00d7 H)\n2. Z(G \u00d7 H) is contained in Z(G) \u00d7 Z(H)\n\nFor the first part, we can use the fact that Z(G) and Z(H) are central subgroups of G and H respectively. From the context, we know that the direct product of central subgroups is central (theorem 74131). Since the centers are central subgroups by definition, Z(G) \u00d7 Z(H) must be contained in Z(G \u00d7 H).\n\nFor the second part, let's take any element (g,h) in Z(G \u00d7 H). This means (g,h) commutes with every element of G \u00d7 H. In particular:\n- For any x in G, (g,h) must commute with (x,1)\n- For any y in H, (g,h) must commute with (1,y)\n\nWhen we work out these commutations using the direct product multiplication rules:\n- (g,h)(x,1) = (gx,h) must equal (xg,h) = (x,1)(g,h)\n- (g,h)(1,y) = (g,hy) must equal (g,yh) = (1,y)(g,h)\n\nFrom these equations:\n- gx = xg for all x in G, which means g is in Z(G)\n- hy = yh for all y in H, which means h is in Z(H)\n\nTherefore (g,h) must be in Z(G) \u00d7 Z(H).\n\nCombining both parts, we can conclude that Z(G \u00d7 H) = Z(G) \u00d7 Z(H).\n\nThe proof relies heavily on the properties of central elements and how multiplication works in direct products, using similar techniques to those shown in the context's proof about direct products of central subgroups.\nPrevious attempt failed with: function expected at\n  z.property\nterm has type\n  \u2191z \u2208 center (G \u00d7 H)\nfunction expected at\n  z.property\nterm has type\n  \u2191z \u2208 center (G \u00d7 H)\napplication type mismatch\n  \u27e8(\u2191z.1, \u2191z.2), fun x => ?m.1839 x\u27e9\nargument\n  fun x => ?m.1839 x\nhas type\n  (x : ?m.1833) \u2192 ?m.1838 x : Sort (imax ?u.1832 ?u.1835)\nbut is expected to have type\n  (\u2191z.1, \u2191z.2) \u2208 center (G \u00d7 H) : Prop\ninvalid constructor \u27e8...\u27e9, expected type must be an inductive type \n  ?m.1833\nPlease revise the proof.",

Let's say V = U\u2081 \u222a U\u2082 \u222a ... \u222a U\u2099, where each U\u1d62 is a proper subspace and n is the smallest number for which this is possible.\n\nThe key insight is that we can use the infinite nature of the field F to show this leads to a contradiction. Here's how:\n\n1) First, pick any vector y that's not in U\u2081 (we can do this since U\u2081 is proper).\n2) Take any vector x in U\u2081.\n3) Since F is infinite, we can pick n+1 different scalars from F (call this set S).\n4) Now consider the vectors of the form x + \u03b1y for each scalar \u03b1 in S.\n\nHere's the crucial part: each of these vectors must lie in some subspace U\u1d62 (since they're in V, which we assumed was the union). But we have n+1 vectors and only n subspaces. By the pigeonhole principle, at least two of these vectors, say x + \u03b1y and x + \u03b2y, must lie in the same subspace U\u1d62.\n\nSince subspaces are closed under linear combinations, we can show that:\n- The vector y must be in U\u1d62 (we can solve for it using the two vectors we found)\n- Then x must also be in U\u1d62 (since we can solve for it using y)\n\nThis means that every vector in U\u2081 must actually be contained in the union of U\u2082 through U\u2099.

Let G be a group of order pq where p and q are distinct primes. Without loss of generality, we can assume p > q.\n\n2.

The key idea is to use Sylow's theorems and show that there must be a normal subgroup, which contradicts simplicity.\n\nFirst, let's factor 224:\n224 = 2^5 \u00d7 7\n\nNow, let's consider the Sylow 7-subgroups. By Sylow's theorems, the number of Sylow 7-subgroups (let's call it n\u2087) must:\n1. Divide the order of the group (224)\n2. Be congruent to 1 modulo 7\n3. Be a factor of 224/7 = 32\n\nThe possible values for n\u2087 that satisfy these conditions must divide 32 and be congruent to 1 mod 7. The only such number is 1, because:\n- Any number larger than 1 that divides 32 (like 2, 4, 8, 16, 32) is not congruent to 1 mod 7\n\nTherefore, n\u2087 must equal 1. When there is exactly one Sylow subgroup, that subgroup must be normal in the group (this is a key theorem about Sylow subgroups).\n\nThis means that any group of order 224 must have a normal subgroup of order 7. The existence of a proper normal subgroup means the group cannot be simple.\n\nTherefore, no group of order 224 can be simple.\n\nThe proof follows a similar pattern to the group of order 48 case from the context, but uses the Sylow 7-subgroups instead of Sylow 2-subgroups to find the normal subgroup.

Here's how we can reason about this:\n\nFirst, since x is nilpotent, we know there exists some positive integer n where x^n = 0. This is the definition of a nilpotent element.\n\nNow, we need to show that 1+x is a unit, which means we need to find its multiplicative inverse. The trick is to look at the geometric series with negative powers of x:\n\n1 - x + x^2 - x^3 + ... + (-1)^(n-1)x^(n-1)\n\nIf we multiply (1+x) by this sum, most terms will cancel out in pairs, and we'll be left with 1. Let's see why:\n\nWhen we multiply (1+x) by this sum, we get:\n(1+x)(1 - x + x^2 - x^3 + ... + (-1)^(n-1)x^(n-1))\n\nDistributing, we get:\n1 - x + x^2 - x^3 + ... + (-1)^(n-1)x^(n-1)    (from multiplying by 1)\n+ x - x^2 + x^3 - ... - (-1)^(n-1)x^n          (from multiplying by x)\n\nNotice that all terms except the first and last cancel out. The first term is 1, and the last term involves x^n, which is 0 since x is nilpotent.\n\nTherefore, (1+x)(1 - x + x^2 - x^3 + ... + (-1)^(n-1)x^(n-1)) = 1\n\nThis shows that 1+x has a multiplicative inverse, namely 1 - x + x^2 - x^3 + ... + (-1)^(n-1)x^(n-1), which makes it a unit in R.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  GroupWithZero R\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nunsolved goals\nR : Type u_1\ninst\u271d : Ring R\nx : R\nhx : IsNilpotent x\nn : \u2115\nhn : x ^ n = 0\n\u22a2 \u2211 i \u2208 Finset.range n, (-1) ^ i * x ^ i + x * \u2211 i \u2208 Finset.range n, (-1) ^ i * x ^ i = 1\ntype mismatch\n  h\u271d\nhas type\n  (1 + x) * \u2211 i \u2208 Finset.range n, (-1) ^ i * x ^ i = 1 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u00ac1 + x = 0 : Prop\nPlease revise the proof.",

Let's start with any nonzero ideal J in the Gaussian integers (\u2124[i]). We know this ideal contains at least one nonzero Gaussian integer - let's call it a + bi, where a and b are regular integers.\n\n2. Consider the norm (or squared modulus) of this Gaussian integer: N(a + bi) = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2. This is always a positive real integer when a and b are integers and at least one of them is nonzero.\n\n3. Now, let's look at the product of this Gaussian integer with its conjugate:\n   (a + bi)(a - bi) = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2\n\n4. This product is important because:\n   - It equals the norm N(a + bi)\n   - It's a real integer (no imaginary part)\n   - Since a + bi is in our ideal J, and a - bi is in \u2124[i], their product must also be in J (because ideals are closed under multiplication by ring elements)\n\n5. Therefore, we've found a nonzero integer (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) that belongs to our ideal J.\n\nThe key insight is that by multiplying any Gaussian integer by its conjugate, we always get a real integer, and this operation preserves membership in the ideal. Since we started with a nonzero element, its norm is a nonzero integer, giving us exactly what we needed to prove.\n\nThis proof is particularly elegant because it uses the fundamental properties of complex conjugates and norms in the Gaussian integers, while also leveraging the fact that ideals are closed under multiplication.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unexpected token '+'; expected '\u27e9'\nPlease revise the proof.",

It would need to factor either as:\n1) A linear factor times a quadratic factor, or\n2) Three linear factors\n\nSo, if x\u00b3 - 9 is reducible in F\u2083\u2081, it must have at least one root in F\u2083\u2081.

Also, we can use Fermat's Little Theorem which states that a\u00b3\u00b9 \u2261 a (mod 31) for any a \u2208 F\u2083\u2081.\n\nWhen we compute a\u00b3 - 9 for each value of a in F\u2083\u2081, we find that no value of a satisfies the equation.

The context breaks this down using the difference of cubes formula into (z - 1)(z\u00b2 + z + 1) = 0.\n\nFrom this factorization, we can see that either z = 1 or z\u00b2 + z + 1 = 0. The quadratic formula applied to z\u00b2 + z + 1 = 0 gives us two solutions, one of which is (-1 + \u221a3i)/2.\n\nSo we know that (-1 + \u221a3i)/2 is algebraically a solution to z\u00b3 = 1. However, we can verify this directly:\n\nTo cube (-1 + \u221a3i)/2, we need to multiply it by itself three times. When we do this multiplication (which involves careful work with complex numbers), the real and imaginary parts will combine in such a way that all imaginary terms cancel out, leaving us with exactly 1.\n\nThis is because this number was specifically constructed as a solution to z\u00b3 = 1 through the factorization and quadratic formula method shown in the context. The fact that it satisfies z\u00b2 + z + 1 = 0 guarantees that when cubed, it equals 1.\n\nTherefore, (-1 + \u221a3i)/2 is indeed a cube root of unity.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

We need to prove that when we take the sum of several invariant subspaces, this new space is also invariant under T.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. First, recall that the sum of subspaces U\u2081 + ... + U\u2098 consists of all vectors that can be written as u\u2081 + ... + u\u2098 where each u\u1d62 comes from the corresponding U\u1d62.\n\n2. To show invariance, we need to prove that when we apply T to any vector in U\u2081 + ... + U\u2098, the result stays in U\u2081 + ... + U\u2098.\n\n3. Take any vector v in U\u2081 + ... + U\u2098. By definition of sum of subspaces, we can write:\n   v = u\u2081 + ... + u\u2098 where each u\u1d62 \u2208 U\u1d62\n\n4.

Similarly, an eigenvalue \u03bc of TS means there exists some nonzero vector w such that (TS)w = \u03bcw.\n\n2) The key insight is to look at the characteristic equations.

This means that for any such subspace W, if v is in W, then T(v) must also be in W.\n\n2) A key insight is that in a vector space V, any vector v can be found in some subspace of dimension dim(V)-1. In fact, any vector is contained in many such subspaces.\n\n3) Now, for any nonzero vector v in V, consider how T must act on v:\n   - Let's take any subspace W of dimension dim(V)-1 containing v\n   - Since W is invariant under T, T(v) must be in W\n   - But we can find another subspace W' of dimension dim(V)-1 containing v\n   - T(v) must also be in W'\n   - The intersection of all such subspaces containing v must be the one-dimensional subspace spanned by v itself\n\n4) Therefore, T(v) must lie in the span of v for every nonzero vector v in V.

When we apply T to v, we get a new vector Tv that must be linearly independent from v. Why? Because if Tv were dependent on v, then v would be an eigenvector, which we know is impossible.\n\n4) This means T pairs up vectors in a special way - each vector v gets paired with Tv, and these pairs are linearly independent from each other.\n\n5) We can continue this process in W: Take any vector not in span{v, Tv}, apply T to it, and get another independent pair.

The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that (\u2211xy)\u00b2 \u2264 (\u2211x\u00b2)(\u2211y\u00b2).\n\n3) To transform our problem into this form, let's make the following substitutions:\n   - Let x_j = a_j\u221aj\n   - Let y_j = b_j/\u221aj\n\n4) With these substitutions:\n   - The left side (\u2211a_jb_j)\u00b2 remains unchanged\n   - The first sum on the right becomes \u2211ja_j\u00b2\n   - The second sum on the right becomes \u2211(b_j\u00b2/j)\n\n5) After making these substitutions, our inequality becomes:\n   (\u2211x_jy_j)\u00b2 \u2264 (\u2211x_j\u00b2)(\u2211y_j\u00b2)\n   \n   Which is exactly the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.\n\n6) Since the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality holds for all real numbers, and our substitutions maintain the reality of the numbers (since j is positive), our original inequality must hold.\n\n7) The equality case occurs when the sequences are proportional, meaning there exists some constant k such that:\n   a_j\u221aj = k(b_j/\u221aj) for all j\n   or equivalently:\n   b_j = kja_j for all j\n\nTherefore, we have proven that:\n(\u2211a_jb_j)\u00b2 \u2264 (\u2211ja_j\u00b2)(\u2211b_j\u00b2/j)\nfor all real numbers a\u2081,...,a\u2099 and b\u2081,...,b\u2099.\n\nThis proof shows that the inequality is essentially a weighted version of Cauchy-Schwarz, where the weights are carefully chosen to match the form of the original inequality.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

Specifically, we know that (x^k)^(-1) = (x^(-1))^k for any integer k.\n\nHere's how we can use this to prove they have the same order:\n\n1) First, let's say x has order n (where n could be finite or infinite). This means n is the smallest positive integer such that x^n = e (or no such n exists if x has infinite order).\n\n2) Now, if x^n = e, then we can raise both sides to the -1 power:\n   - (x^n)^(-1) = e^(-1)\n   - But e^(-1) = e (since e is its own inverse)\n   - And (x^n)^(-1) = (x^(-1))^n (by the relationship mentioned above)\n   - Therefore, (x^(-1))^n = e\n\n3) This shows that if n is the order of x, then x^(-1) also has order less than or equal to n.\n\n4) We can make the same argument in reverse:\n   - If (x^(-1))^k = e for some k\n   - Then ((x^(-1))^k)^(-1) = e^(-1) = e\n   - But ((x^(-1))^k)^(-1) = x^k\n   - So x^k = e\n\n5) This shows that if k is the order of x^(-1), then x has order less than or equal to k.\n\n6) Combining points 3 and 5, we can conclude that the order of x must equal the order of x^(-1).\n\n7) The same logic applies if x has infinite order - if x never reaches e with any finite power, then x^(-1) can't either, and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, x and x^(-1) must have exactly the same order, whether finite or infinite.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

Let's call this mapping \u03b8, where for any element (a,b) in A \u00d7 B, we map it to (b,a) in B \u00d7 A.\n\nHere's why this works:\n\n1. First, this mapping \u03b8 is clearly bijective (one-to-one and onto):\n   - For any (a,b) in A \u00d7 B, there is exactly one corresponding (b,a) in B \u00d7 A\n   - Every element in B \u00d7 A can be reached by swapping some element from A \u00d7 B\n   - Two different elements in A \u00d7 B will always map to different elements in B \u00d7 A\n\n2. The crucial part is showing that \u03b8 preserves the group operation. Let's see what happens when we combine two elements:\n   - Take any two elements (a\u2081,b\u2081) and (a\u2082,b\u2082) in A \u00d7 B\n   - In A \u00d7 B, when we combine them we get: (a\u2081\u00b7a\u2082, b\u2081\u00b7b\u2082)\n   - After applying \u03b8, this becomes: (b\u2081\u00b7b\u2082, a\u2081\u00b7a\u2082)\n   \n   Going the other way:\n   - First apply \u03b8 to get (b\u2081,a\u2081) and (b\u2082,a\u2082)\n   - Then combine these in B \u00d7 A to get: (b\u2081\u00b7b\u2082, a\u2081\u00b7a\u2082)\n   \n   We get the same result either way, which shows \u03b8 preserves the group operation.\n\n3. Since \u03b8 is both bijective and preserves the group operation, it is an isomorphism between A \u00d7 B and B \u00d7 A.\n\nThis proof shows that not only are A \u00d7 B and B \u00d7 A isomorphic, but there's a very natural isomorphism between them - just swap the components of each pair.

Then:\n   - a is in H\n   - 1/a is in H (by the given property)\n   - Since H is a subgroup under addition, we can add these: a + 1/a is in H\n   - We can also add multiple copies of a or 1/a since H is closed under addition\n\n4) Furthermore:\n   - If we have a and b in H, we can get their sum and difference\n   - We can also get their reciprocals\n   - This means we can generate fractions with various numerators and denominators\n\n5) The crucial realization is that through these operations (adding elements and taking reciprocals), we can actually generate all rational numbers. This is because:\n   - We can get integers through repeated addition\n   - We can get reciprocals of integers\n   - Through addition and subtraction of these, we can construct any rational number\n\n6) Therefore:\n   - If H = {0}, we're done\n   - If H contains any nonzero element, the closure properties of being a subgroup combined with the reciprocal property force H to contain all rational numbers\n\n7) Conclusion: There is no \"in-between\" case. H must either be {0} or all of \u211a.\n\nThis proof shows that the reciprocal property, combined with the subgroup properties (closure under addition and inverses), is powerful enough to generate all rational numbers from any single nonzero rational number.",

Here's how we can reason about this:\n\n1) First, let's start with our proper subgroup H of G. Since H is proper, we know H \u2260 G.\n\n2) We can construct a chain of subgroups in the following way:\n   - Start with H\u2081 = H\n   - If H\u2081 is not maximal, then by definition there must exist a larger proper subgroup H\u2082 that contains H\u2081\n   - We can continue this process, creating a chain H\u2081 \u2282 H\u2082 \u2282 H\u2083 \u2282 ... \u2282 G\n\n3) Key insight: This chain must terminate because:\n   - G is finite (given in the hypothesis)\n   - Each step in the chain gives us a strictly larger subgroup\n   - The size of each subgroup in the chain is bounded above by |G|\n\n4) When the chain terminates, we must have reached a maximal subgroup. Let's call it M.\n   - M is proper (M \u2260 G) because each step in our chain produced a proper subgroup\n   - M is maximal because if there were a larger proper subgroup containing M, we could have continued the chain\n\n5) This maximal subgroup M contains our original subgroup H (by construction), and is itself a proper subgroup of G.\n\nThe crucial point is that the finiteness of G guarantees that our construction must terminate. This is because each step in the chain gives us a strictly larger subgroup, and we can't have an infinite strictly increasing chain of subgroups in a finite group.\n\nThis proof uses the well-ordering principle implicitly - any strictly increasing sequence of subgroups in a finite group must be finite, and therefore must terminate at some point. When it terminates, we've found our maximal subgroup.\nPrevious attempt failed with: expected ';' or line break\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

In a cyclic group, all subgroups are also cyclic and are generated by powers of the generator. The order of these subgroups must divide n. If we take x^k for any k dividing n, this generates a subgroup of order n/k. For H to be maximal, n/k must be as small as possible while still being proper - this means k must be prime. Otherwise, if k were composite, we could find a larger proper subgroup between H and G.\n\nFor the reverse direction (\u21d0):\nIf H is generated by x^p where p is prime and divides n, then the order of H is n/p. To show H is maximal, we need to prove there can't be any subgroup strictly between H and G. Any such subgroup would have order strictly between n/p and n. But by the fundamental theorem of cyclic groups, the orders of subgroups must divide n. There can't be any such divisor between n/p and n when p is prime, because that would contradict p being prime.\n\nThe key insight is that the maximal subgroups correspond exactly to the minimal proper divisors of the group's order, which are precisely the prime divisors. This is why the maximal subgroups must be generated by x^p where p is prime.\n\nThis relationship between maximal subgroups and prime divisors is what makes the equivalence work in both directions.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

The group G is a p-group (its order is a power of p)\n2. We're looking at a subgroup H whose index is p (the smallest possible prime)\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\nIn a p-group G, every element has order that's a power of p. This means that when we look at how G acts by conjugation on the cosets of H, we're working with elements of p-power order.\n\nWhen H has index p, there are exactly p cosets of H in G. These cosets form a set on which G acts by conjugation. This action gives us a homomorphism from G to the symmetric group on p elements, Sp.\n\nNow, by Lagrange's theorem, the order of the image of this homomorphism must divide both |G| (which is p^\u03b1) and |Sp| (which is p!). The only numbers that divide both of these are powers of p.\n\nBut in Sp, the only subgroup whose order is a power of p is contained in the alternating group Ap, and for p > 2, this subgroup can only move elements in cycles of length p. This means the action must be trivial, as any non-trivial action would require elements of order not dividing p^\u03b1.\n\nTherefore, G must act trivially on the cosets of H by conjugation, which is equivalent to saying that H is normal in G.\n\nThe case p = 2 is even simpler, as we know any subgroup of index 2 is automatically normal (this is a well-known result that we can see in the context).\n\nThis shows that H must be normal in G regardless of which prime p we're working with.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'normal_of_index_eq_prime'\nPlease revise the proof.",

The uniqueness follows because G is abelian.\n\n2) Since P and Q are subgroups of prime order, they are cyclic. Let's say P = <a> and Q = <b> where a has order p and b has order q.\n\n3) Since G is abelian, P and Q intersect only at the identity element e. This is because any element in the intersection would have to have an order that divides both p and q, but since p and q are distinct primes, only the identity element satisfies this.\n\n4) Now consider the element ab (product of generators of P and Q). Since G is abelian, we can use the fact that a and b commute.\n\n5) The order of ab must divide |G| = pq. However, it cannot be p or q because:\n   - If (ab)^p = e, then b^p = a^{-p} = e, contradicting that b has order q\n   - Similarly, if (ab)^q = e, we get a contradiction\n\n6) Therefore, the order of ab must be pq, making ab a generator of G.\n\n7) Since G has an element that generates the entire group, G is cyclic by definition.\n\nThis proof relies heavily on the fact that G is abelian (which ensures the Sylow subgroups commute) and that p and q are distinct primes (which ensures the Sylow subgroups intersect trivially).

Here's why this helps us:\n\n1. Take any element g in G. Since K is normal in G, when we conjugate K by g (that is, gKg\u207b\u00b9), we get K back.\n\n2. This conjugation by g, when restricted to K, is actually an automorphism of K. This is because conjugation preserves the group structure and maps K to itself.\n\n3. Since H is characteristic in K, it must be preserved by ALL automorphisms of K, including this conjugation automorphism.\n\n4. Therefore, when we conjugate H by g, it must map H back to itself (because conjugation by g is an automorphism of K, and H is characteristic in K).\n\n5.

By Sylow's theorems:\n   - n\u2081\u2089 \u2261 1 (mod 19)\n   - n\u2081\u2089 must divide 2907/19 = 153\n   - 153 = 3\u00b2 \u00d7 17\n\n2) The possible values for n\u2081\u2089 that satisfy both conditions must be:\n   - n\u2081\u2089 = 1 (since any other number congruent to 1 mod 19 would be too large to divide 153)\n\n3) Therefore, there is exactly one Sylow 19-subgroup, and by a fundamental theorem of Sylow subgroups, a unique Sylow subgroup is always normal.\n\n4) This normal Sylow 19-subgroup gives us a proper normal subgroup of G.\n\nTherefore, G has a proper normal subgroup (of order 19), which by definition means G is not simple.\n\nThe key insight is that we only needed to look at one prime factor (19) and show that its Sylow subgroup must be normal.

Since P is a normal Sylow p-subgroup of G, we know two important things:\n   - P is the largest p-subgroup of G (by definition of Sylow p-subgroup)\n   - P is normal in G, meaning gPg\u207b\u00b9 = P for all g \u2208 G\n\n2. From the given context theorem (2006), we know that when we have a normal subgroup N and a Sylow p-subgroup P, their intersection P \u2229 N is a Sylow p-subgroup of N. In our case, P is the normal subgroup and H is the subgroup we're intersecting with.\n\n3. P \u2229 H is a p-subgroup of H because:\n   - It's a subgroup of P (so it's a p-group)\n   - It's contained in H\n\n4. To prove uniqueness, suppose Q is any Sylow p-subgroup of H:\n   - Q is a p-subgroup of H\n   - Since H is a subgroup of G, Q is also a p-subgroup of G\n   - But P is the unique Sylow p-subgroup of G (because it's normal)\n   - Therefore Q must be contained in P (as P contains all p-elements of G)\n   - Since Q is in H, Q must be contained in P \u2229 H\n   - But Q is a Sylow p-subgroup of H, so it must be maximal\n   - Therefore Q = P \u2229 H\n\n5. This shows that P \u2229 H is the only possible Sylow p-subgroup of H, making it unique.\n\nThe key insight is that the normality of P in G means it contains all p-elements of G, which forces any p-subgroup of H to live inside P \u2229 H.

It has no proper zero divisors\n\nLet's call our field F and our subring R. We know that R contains the identity element of F.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Since R is a subring of F, it inherits the multiplication and addition operations from F. Since field multiplication is commutative, the multiplication in R must also be commutative. This takes care of the first requirement.\n\n2. For the second requirement (no proper zero divisors), let's consider any two elements a and b in R where their product is zero: a \u00d7 b = 0\n\n3. Since R is a subring of F, this product is also zero in F. But we know from the context (Field has no Proper Zero Divisors) that in a field, if a product is zero, then one of the factors must be zero.\n\n4. Therefore, either a = 0 or b = 0 in F. Since these elements are in R, they must also be zero in R.\n\n5. This proves that R has no proper zero divisors, as any time we have a product of zero in R, one of the factors must be zero.\n\nSince R is commutative and has no proper zero divisors, it satisfies the definition of an integral domain.\n\nThe key insight here is that the subring inherits both the commutativity and the zero divisor property from the field, as long as we know it contains the identity element.

The key insight is that we can connect polynomial zero divisors to zero divisors in the base ring R.\n\nForward direction (\"only if\"):\nIf p(x) is a zero divisor in R[x], then there exists some nonzero polynomial q(x) such that p(x)q(x) = 0. The crucial observation is that when we multiply these polynomials, the coefficient of the lowest degree term in q(x) gives us our required element b in R. This works because when we multiply polynomials, the lowest degree terms must multiply to give zero, which means the coefficient must be a zero divisor in R.\n\nReverse direction (\"if\"):\nIf there exists a nonzero b in R such that bp(x) = 0, then p(x) is immediately a zero divisor because b can be viewed as a constant polynomial (degree 0) in R[x], and we've found a nonzero polynomial (namely b) that multiplies with p(x) to give zero.\n\nThe proof relies on two key facts:\n1. The polynomial ring R[x] inherits its multiplication properties from R\n2. When a constant b multiplies a polynomial p(x), it multiplies each coefficient of p(x) by b\n\nThis characterization is particularly elegant because it reduces the question of zero divisors in the polynomial ring to a simpler question about zero divisors in the base ring R. It shows that polynomial zero divisors are essentially \"lifted\" from zero divisors in the coefficient ring.\n\nThe result is also intuitively reasonable: if some nonzero constant b kills p(x), then p(x) must be a zero divisor since we've found a nonzero element that multiplies with it to give zero. Conversely, if p(x) is a zero divisor, its interaction with some nonzero polynomial must produce a zero divisor at the coefficient level.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

In this ring, the only units are \u00b11.\n\n1) For 2:\nThe key is to look at the norm of elements in this ring. For any a + b\u221a(-n), its norm is a\u00b2 + nb\u00b2. If 2 were reducible, it could be written as a product of two non-unit elements whose norms multiply to give 4 (the norm of 2). Given that n > 3, any non-trivial factorization would require elements with norms less than 4, but greater than 1. However, since n > 3, there are no elements in R with norm 2 (as a\u00b2 + nb\u00b2 = 2 has no solutions for n > 3). Therefore, 2 must be irreducible.\n\n2) For \u221a(-n):\nIf \u221a(-n) were reducible, it could be written as a product (a + b\u221a(-n))(c + d\u221a(-n)) = \u221a(-n). The norm of \u221a(-n) is n. Again, since n is squarefree and > 3, any factorization would require elements with norms whose product is n. But since n is squarefree, there are no proper factorizations of n that could correspond to norms of elements in R. Therefore, \u221a(-n) is irreducible.\n\n3) For 1 + \u221a(-n):\nThe norm of 1 + \u221a(-n) is 1 + n. If this were reducible, we would need elements whose norms multiply to give 1 + n. Since n > 3, 1 + n is greater than 4, and any proper factorization would require at least one factor with norm less than \u221a(1 + n). However, given that n > 3, there are no elements in R with such norms (as a\u00b2 + nb\u00b2 would need to be less than \u221a(1 + n), which is impossible given the constraints). Therefore, 1 + \u221a(-n) is irreducible.\n\nThe key insight throughout this proof is using the norm function and the fact that n > 3 and squarefree to show that no non-trivial factorizations can exist for these elements. The norm function preserves multiplication, and the constraints on n ensure that the only possible factorizations would require elements that cannot exist in the ring.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'irreducible_of_norm_eq_prime_sq'\nunknown identifier 'irreducible_of_norm_eq_prime_sq'\nunknown identifier 'irreducible_of_norm_eq_prime_sq'\nPlease revise the proof.",

Here's the reasoning:\n\n1) First, when $q \\equiv 3 \\bmod 4$, we can show that $q$ remains prime in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$. This is because:\n   - If $q$ were not prime in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$, it would factor as a product of Gaussian integers\n   - But for primes that are 3 mod 4, no such factorization exists\n\n2) Since $q$ is prime in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$, the ideal $(q)$ is a maximal ideal in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$. This follows because:\n   - Prime elements generate maximal ideals in unique factorization domains\n   - $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$ is a unique factorization domain\n\n3) By a fundamental theorem of ring theory, whenever we quotient a ring by a maximal ideal, the result is a field. Therefore, $\\mathbb{Z}[i]/(q)$ is indeed a field.\n\n4) For the number of elements:\n   - Each element in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]/(q)$ can be uniquely represented as $a + bi$ where $a,b \\in \\mathbb{Z}/q\\mathbb{Z}$\n   - Since $q$ is prime, $\\mathbb{Z}/q\\mathbb{Z}$ has exactly $q$ elements\n   - Therefore, there are $q$ choices for $a$ and $q$ choices for $b$\n   - This gives us exactly $q^2$ elements in total\n\nThus, $\\mathbb{Z}[i]/(q)$ is a field with exactly $q^2$ elements.\n\nThe condition $q \\equiv 3 \\bmod 4$ is crucial here - it ensures $q$ remains prime in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$, which is essential for the ideal $(q)$ to be maximal and thus for the quotient to be a field.\nPrevious attempt failed with: \nPlease revise the proof.",

This means that for each pair, at least one of the variables must be in any prime ideal containing their product.\n\n3) Key insight: For each pair, we have a choice - we can put either x\u2082\u1d62\u208b\u2081 or x\u2082\u1d62 into our prime ideal, but we must choose at least one of them.\n\n4) We can construct prime ideals in this ring by making these choices for each pair.

This violates the requirement that a topology must be closed under arbitrary unions.\n\nTherefore, T\u2081 \u222a T\u2082 is not a topology on X, which proves that the union of topologies is not necessarily a topology.\n\nThis counterexample is particularly elegant because it uses the smallest possible set (three elements) where this phenomenon can occur, as we know from the context that the union of topologies on sets with fewer than three elements is always a topology.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  Singleton ?m.853 (Type u_1)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  Insert ?m.820 (Type u_1)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  Insert ?m.786 (Type u_1)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\ntype mismatch\n  Unit\nhas type\n  Type : Type 1\nbut is expected to have type\n  Type u_2 : Type (u_2 + 1)\nunsolved goals\ni : sorryAx (Type u_2) true\n\u22a2 IsEmpty (sorryAx (Type u_1) true) \u2228\n    univ = {0} \u2228 univ = {1} \u2228 univ = {2} \u2228 univ = {0, 1} \u2228 univ = {0, 2} \u2228 univ = {1, 2} \u2228 univ = {0, 1, 2}\nunsolved goals\ni : sorryAx (Type u_2) true\n\u22a2 \u2200 (s t : Set (sorryAx (Type u_1) true)),\n    s = \u2205 \u2228 s = {0} \u2228 s = {1} \u2228 s = {2} \u2228 s = {0, 1} \u2228 s = {0, 2} \u2228 s = {1, 2} \u2228 s = {0, 1, 2} \u2192\n      t = \u2205 \u2228 t = {0} \u2228 t = {1} \u2228 t = {2} \u2228 t = {0, 1} \u2228 t = {0, 2} \u2228 t = {1, 2} \u2228 t = {0, 1, 2} \u2192\n        s \u2229 t = \u2205 \u2228\n          s \u2229 t = {0} \u2228 s \u2229 t = {1} \u2228 s \u2229 t = {2} \u2228 s \u2229 t = {0, 1} \u2228 s \u2229 t = {0, 2} \u2228 s \u2229 t = {1, 2} \u2228 s \u2229 t = {0, 1, 2}\nunsolved goals\ni : sorryAx (Type u_2) true\n\u22a2 \u2200 (s : Set (Set (sorryAx (Type u_1) true))),\n    (\u2200 t \u2208 s, t = \u2205 \u2228 t = {0} \u2228 t = {1} \u2228 t = {2} \u2228 t = {0, 1} \u2228 t = {0, 2} \u2228 t = {1, 2} \u2228 t = {0, 1, 2}) \u2192\n      (\u2200 s_1 \u2208 s, s_1 = \u2205) \u2228\n        \u22c3\u2080 s = {0} \u2228 \u22c3\u2080 s = {1} \u2228 \u22c3\u2080 s = {2} \u2228 \u22c3\u2080 s = {0, 1} \u2228 \u22c3\u2080 s = {0, 2} \u2228 \u22c3\u2080 s = {1, 2} \u2228 \u22c3\u2080 s = {0, 1, 2}\nunsolved goals\ncase w.refine_1\n\u22a2 sorryAx (Type u_2) true \u2192 OfNat (sorryAx (Type u_1) true) 0\n\ncase w.refine_2\n\u22a2 sorryAx (Type u_2) true \u2192 OfNat (sorryAx (Type u_1) true) 1\n\ncase w.refine_3\n\u22a2 sorryAx (Type u_2) true \u2192 OfNat (sorryAx (Type u_1) true) 2\n\ncase w.refine_4\n\u22a2 sorryAx (Type u_2) true \u2192 OfNat (sorryAx (Type u_1) true) 0\n\ncase w.refine_5\n\u22a2 sorryAx (Type u_2) true \u2192 OfNat (sorryAx (Type u_1) true) 1\n\ncase w.refine_6\n\u22a2 sorryAx (Type u_2) true \u2192 OfNat (sorryAx (Type u_1) true) 0\n\ncase w.refine_7\n\u22a2 sorryAx (Type u_2) true \u2192 OfNat (sorryAx (Type u_1) true) 2\n\ncase w.refine_8\n\u22a2 sorryAx (Type u_2) true \u2192 OfNat (sorryAx (Type u_1) true) 1\n\ncase w.refine_9\n\u22a2 sorryAx (Type u_2) true \u2192 OfNat (sorryAx (Type u_1) true) 2\n\ncase w.refine_10\n\u22a2 sorryAx (Type u_2) true \u2192 OfNat (sorryAx (Type u_1) true) 0\n\ncase w.refine_11\n\u22a2 sorryAx (Type u_2) true \u2192 OfNat (sorryAx (Type u_1) true) 1\n\ncase w.refine_12\n\u22a2 sorryAx (Type u_2) true \u2192 OfNat (sorryAx (Type u_1) true) 2\nPlease revise the proof.",

Let's call this intersection $\\mathcal{T}$. We need to show three things:\n\n1. First, that $\\mathcal{T}$ is actually a topology\n2. Second, that it's contained in all $\\mathcal{T}_\\alpha$\n3. Third, that it's the largest such topology\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\nThe intersection $\\mathcal{T}$ of all $\\mathcal{T}_\\alpha$ will naturally be contained in each $\\mathcal{T}_\\alpha$ by the definition of intersection. To show it's a topology, we need to verify the topology axioms:\n\n- The empty set and whole space $X$ are in $\\mathcal{T}$ because they're in every topology $\\mathcal{T}_\\alpha$\n- For any collection of sets in $\\mathcal{T}$, their union must be in $\\mathcal{T}$. This holds because if sets are in $\\mathcal{T}$, they're in every $\\mathcal{T}_\\alpha$, and since each $\\mathcal{T}_\\alpha$ is a topology, their union is in each $\\mathcal{T}_\\alpha$, thus in $\\mathcal{T}$\n- Similarly, finite intersections of sets in $\\mathcal{T}$ must be in $\\mathcal{T}$, which follows the same logic\n\nTo prove it's the largest such topology, suppose there was a larger topology $\\mathcal{S}$ contained in all $\\mathcal{T}_\\alpha$. Then $\\mathcal{S}$ would be contained in their intersection $\\mathcal{T}$, but since we assumed it was larger, this is impossible unless $\\mathcal{S} = \\mathcal{T}$.\n\nUniqueness follows from this maximality - if there were two such largest topologies, each would have to be contained in the other, making them equal.\n\nThis construction is similar to the given context about generated topologies, but working in the opposite direction - instead of building up the smallest topology containing a collection, we're finding the largest topology contained in a collection.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token '\u22c2'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

The key is understanding how a subbasis generates a topology and what it means for a topology to contain $\\mathcal{A}$.\n\nFirst, let's call the topology generated by $\\mathcal{A}$ as $\\tau_\\mathcal{A}$ and the intersection of all topologies containing $\\mathcal{A}$ as $\\tau_{int}$. We need to show these are equal.\n\nFor one direction ($\\tau_\\mathcal{A} \\subseteq \\tau_{int}$):\nThe topology generated by $\\mathcal{A}$ consists of all unions of finite intersections of elements from $\\mathcal{A}$. Any topology that contains $\\mathcal{A}$ must contain all these finite intersections (since a topology is closed under finite intersections) and must contain all unions of these intersections (since a topology is closed under arbitrary unions). Therefore, $\\tau_\\mathcal{A}$ must be contained in every topology that contains $\\mathcal{A}$, and thus must be contained in their intersection.\n\nFor the other direction ($\\tau_{int} \\subseteq \\tau_\\mathcal{A}$):\n$\\tau_\\mathcal{A}$ is itself a topology that contains $\\mathcal{A}$ (by construction).

Here's the intuitive reasoning:\n\nFirst, we need to show two key properties for this collection to be a basis:\n1. Every open set in \u211d can be written as a union of these rational-endpoint intervals\n2. These intervals actually generate the standard topology\n\nHere's the main argument:\n\nTake any open set U in \u211d and any point x in U. Since U is open, there must be some open interval (c,d) containing x that's completely contained in U. Even though c and d might be irrational, we can find rational numbers a and b such that:\nc < a < x < b < d\n\nThis is possible because the rational numbers are dense in the real numbers - between any two real numbers we can always find a rational number. The interval (a,b) with rational endpoints contains x and is contained in (c,d), which is contained in U.\n\nTherefore, every point in any open set is contained in some rational-endpoint open interval that's contained in the original open set. This means any open set can be written as a union of rational-endpoint intervals.\n\nConversely, every interval with rational endpoints is open in the standard topology, so the topology generated by these intervals can't be larger than the standard topology.\n\nSince we've shown that every standard open set is a union of rational-endpoint intervals, and every rational-endpoint interval is standard open, the topology generated by these intervals must exactly equal the standard topology.\n\nThis proves that the collection of open intervals with rational endpoints forms a basis for the standard topology on \u211d.\n\nThe proof is similar in spirit to the given context about open balls with rational centers forming a basis for \u211d\u00b2, but simplified for the one-dimensional case.\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  (IsOpen.mem_nhds_iff isOpen_Ioo).mp hS\nargument\n  hS\nhas type\n  IsOpen S : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  Ioo ?m.1495 ?m.1496 \u2208 \ud835\udcdd ?m.1499 : Prop\nrcases tactic failed: right\u271d : Preorder.toLT.1 ?m.1499 ?m.1496 is not an inductive datatype\nPlease revise the proof.",

We need to show that it doesn't matter whether we get to A's topology directly from X or by going through Y first - we end up with the same topology either way.\n\nHere's the key reasoning:\n\n1. First, let's understand what it means for A to inherit a topology from Y:\n   - When A inherits a topology from Y, the open sets in A are created by taking open sets in Y and intersecting them with A\n   - But Y itself inherits its open sets from X, so Y's open sets are intersections of X's open sets with Y\n\n2. So when we get to A through Y, we're doing a two-step process:\n   - First taking an open set U from X and intersecting it with Y to get an open set in Y\n   - Then taking that result and intersecting it with A\n\n3. This gives us expressions of the form: (U \u2229 Y) \u2229 A, where U is open in X\n\n4. On the other hand, getting to A directly from X means:\n   - Taking open sets U from X and intersecting them directly with A\n   - This gives us expressions of the form: U \u2229 A\n\n5. The key insight is that since A is a subset of Y, when we intersect any set with both Y and A, it's the same as just intersecting with A\n   - Because A \u2286 Y, intersecting with Y doesn't add any additional restriction\n   - So (U \u2229 Y) \u2229 A = U \u2229 A\n\n6. Therefore, both approaches produce exactly the same collection of open sets in A:\n   - The sets we get by going through Y (two-step intersection)\n   - The sets we get by going directly from X (single intersection)\n\nThis shows that A inherits the same topology whether we view it as a subspace of Y or as a subspace of X.\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  And.intro hU\nargument\n  hU\nhas type\n  IsOpen U : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  IsOpen (Subtype.val '' ?m.612) : Prop\ntype mismatch\n  (isOpen_induced_iff.mp hU).2\nhas type\n  IsOpen \u22ef.1 \u2227 Subtype.val \u207b\u00b9' \u22ef.1 = Subtype.val '' U : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  IsOpen U : Prop\nunsolved goals\nX : Type u_1\ninst\u271d : TopologicalSpace X\nY : Set X\nA : Set \u2191Y\nU : Set \u2191A\nhU : IsOpen U\n\u22a2 ?m.612 = Subtype.val '' U\n\nX : Type u_1\ninst\u271d : TopologicalSpace X\nY : Set X\nA : Set \u2191Y\nU : Set \u2191A\nhU : IsOpen U\n\u22a2 Set { x // x \u2208 Y }\nPlease revise the proof.",

Our collection is countable\n\nFor the first part, let U be any open set in R\u00b2 and let (x,y) be any point in U. Since U is open, there exists some open ball B around (x,y) contained in U. This ball can be inscribed in some open rectangle with real number coordinates that's still contained in U.\n\nNow, we need to find a rectangle with rational coordinates that contains (x,y) and is contained in our original rectangle. We can do this by:\n1. Finding rational numbers a,b where a < x < b\n2. Finding rational numbers c,d where c < y < d\n\nThis is possible because between any two real numbers, we can always find a rational number (density of rationals in reals). So we can find:\n- a rational number 'a' between the left edge of our real rectangle and x\n- a rational number 'b' between x and the right edge\n- a rational number 'c' between the bottom edge and y\n- a rational number 'd' between y and the top edge\n\nThe resulting rectangle (a,b) \u00d7 (c,d) with rational coordinates contains (x,y) and is contained in U.\n\nFor countability, we can show this collection is countable because:\n1. The rational numbers Q are countable\n2. We're taking a Cartesian product Q \u00d7 Q \u00d7 Q \u00d7 Q (for the four coordinates)\n3. A finite Cartesian product of countable sets is countable\n4. We're only using 4-tuples (a,b,c,d) where a < b and c < d, which gives us a subset of this countable set\n\nTherefore, our collection of rational-coordinate rectangles forms a countable basis for R\u00b2.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unexpected token ','; expected '\u21a6', '=>'\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

We're looking at the set of all points x where f(x) \u2264 g(x). Let's call this set A = {x \u2208 X | f(x) \u2264 g(x)}.\n\n2) A key insight is that we can view this as the preimage of a closed set under a continuous function. Here's how:\n\n3) Consider the function h: X \u2192 Y \u00d7 Y defined by h(x) = (f(x), g(x)). This function maps each point to an ordered pair of the f and g values at that point.\n\n4) In Y \u00d7 Y (with the product topology), the set D = {(y\u2081, y\u2082) | y\u2081 \u2264 y\u2082} is closed. This is because Y is in the order topology, and in an order topology, sets of the form {y | y \u2264 a} and {y | y \u2265 a} are closed for any a.\n\n5) Now, our set A is actually the preimage of D under h. That is:\n   A = h\u207b\u00b9(D) = {x \u2208 X | h(x) \u2208 D} = {x \u2208 X | f(x) \u2264 g(x)}\n\n6) The function h is continuous because:\n   - f is continuous by assumption\n   - g is continuous by assumption\n   - The product of continuous functions is continuous\n\n7) Since h is continuous and D is closed, h\u207b\u00b9(D) must be closed (because continuous functions have the property that preimages of closed sets are closed).\n\nTherefore, A = {x | f(x) \u2264 g(x)} is closed in X.\n\nThe key insight that makes this proof work is recognizing that we can reformulate the problem in terms of preimages of closed sets under continuous functions, which preserves closedness.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'let'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

The key insight is that any two different extensions would have to agree on the original domain A and differ somewhere on the boundary points of A.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. First, let's suppose for the sake of contradiction that we have two different continuous extensions g\u2081 and g\u2082 from \u0100 to Y that both extend f.\n\n2. By definition of being extensions of f, both g\u2081 and g\u2082 must agree with f on all points in A. That is, for any point a \u2208 A, we have g\u2081(a) = f(a) = g\u2082(a).\n\n3. If g\u2081 and g\u2082 were different functions, there must be at least one point x in \u0100 (specifically in \u0100 - A, i.e., on the boundary of A) where g\u2081(x) \u2260 g\u2082(x).\n\n4. Now, since x is in the closure of A, there must exist a sequence of points {x\u2099} from A that converges to x.\n\n5. Because both g\u2081 and g\u2082 are continuous, we know:\n   - g\u2081(x\u2099) must converge to g\u2081(x)\n   - g\u2082(x\u2099) must converge to g\u2082(x)\n\n6. But for each n, x\u2099 is in A, so g\u2081(x\u2099) = f(x\u2099) = g\u2082(x\u2099)\n\n7. This means both sequences {g\u2081(x\u2099)} and {g\u2082(x\u2099)} are actually the same sequence.\n\n8. Since Y is Hausdorff, limits in Y are unique. Therefore, g\u2081(x) = g\u2082(x).\n\n9. This contradicts our assumption that g\u2081 and g\u2082 differed at x.\n\nTherefore, any continuous extension must be unique.

Here's the reasoning:\n\n1) First, let's understand what happens at different x values:\n   - When x = 1, fn(1) = 1 for all n\n   - When 0 \u2264 x < 1, fn(x) approaches 0 as n increases\n   This creates a \"jump\" effect near x = 1\n\n2) For any fixed x between 0 and 1 (strictly less than 1), x\u207f gets arbitrarily close to 0 as n grows large.

To prove B is connected, we'll show that any clopen subset of B must be either empty or all of B.\n\nSuppose U is a clopen subset of B. Let V be its complement in B. Both U and V are clopen in B, and they partition B.\n\nNow, since A is connected and intersects with B, it can't be split between U and V - it must lie entirely in one of them. Let's say some point of A is in U. Then by connectedness of A, all of A must be in U.\n\nHere's the crucial part: since A intersects with each A_\u03b1 (given in the hypothesis), and we know A is contained in U, each A_\u03b1 must share a point with U. But each A_\u03b1 is itself connected, so by the same reasoning as before, each A_\u03b1 must lie entirely in U.\n\nTherefore, U contains A and all the A_\u03b1 sets.

The key insight is to use contradiction and leverage the properties of quotient maps along with the given connected conditions.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1) Let's assume, for the sake of contradiction, that X is not connected. This means X can be separated into two disjoint, non-empty open sets A and B that form a separation of X.\n\n2) Since p is a quotient map, we know that for any subset of Y, its preimage being open in X implies the subset is open in Y. Using this property, we can try to construct a separation of Y from the separation of X.\n\n3) Consider the sets p(A) and p(B) in Y. Since p is a quotient map, these sets would form a separation of Y if they were both open and disjoint. However, we know Y is connected, so this can't happen.\n\n4) Here's the crucial part: For any point y \u2208 Y, its preimage p\u207b\u00b9({y}) must lie entirely within either A or B. It cannot intersect both because:\n   - p\u207b\u00b9({y}) is connected (given in the hypothesis)\n   - If it intersected both A and B, it would contradict the fact that p\u207b\u00b9({y}) is connected, as A and B form a separation\n\n5) This means we can define:\n   - U = {y \u2208 Y : p\u207b\u00b9({y}) \u2286 A}\n   - V = {y \u2208 Y : p\u207b\u00b9({y}) \u2286 B}\n\n6) These sets U and V would form a separation of Y because:\n   - They are disjoint (from how we defined them)\n   - Their union is Y (every preimage must be in either A or B)\n   - They are both non-empty (since A and B are non-empty)\n   - They are both open (due to p being a quotient map)\n\n7) But this contradicts our assumption that Y is connected, as we've found a separation of Y.\n\n8) Therefore, our initial assumption that X is not connected must be false, and X must be connected.\n\nThe key to this proof is understanding how the connectedness of the fibers (p\u207b\u00b9({y})) and the connectedness of Y together force X to be connected through the properties of the quotient map.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'connectedSpace_of_connected_preimages'\nPlease revise the proof.",

We need to show A has a limit point. If A has no limit point, then for each x \u2208 X, there would be an open neighborhood U\u2093 containing x that contains at most finitely many points of A. The collection {U\u2093} forms an open cover of X. Since X is countably compact, this cover has a finite subcover. But this would mean A is finite (since each U\u2093 contains only finitely many points of A), contradicting our assumption that A is infinite. Therefore, A must have a limit point.\n\nFor the reverse direction (\u21d0):\nSuppose X is limit point compact and let {U\u1d62} be a countable open cover of X with no finite subcover. We can construct a sequence of points {x\u2099} where each x\u2099 is not covered by the first n sets in the cover. This sequence must be infinite (otherwise we'd have a finite subcover). Since X is limit point compact, this sequence must have a limit point p. But p must be in some U\u2096 from our cover, and U\u2096 must contain infinitely many points of our sequence (since p is a limit point). This contradicts our construction where no point after the kth was in U\u2096. Therefore, our original assumption was wrong, and every countable open cover must have a finite subcover.\n\nThe T\u2081 property is crucial here because it ensures that finite sets are closed, which we need for the equivalence to hold. In a T\u2081 space, if we have a finite set of points, each individual point is closed, making the finite set closed, which means its complement is open. This property is essential for our argument about neighborhoods containing only finitely many points.\n\nTherefore, in a T\u2081 space, countable compactness and limit point compactness are equivalent.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

This gives us:\n   - An open neighborhood U of a\n   - An open neighborhood V of b\n   Such that U and V are disjoint\n\n3) Now, we can use regularity again, but this time with:\n   - Point a and the closed set X\\V\n   - Point b and the closed set X\\U\n   \n4) This gives us two new pairs of disjoint open sets:\n   - An open neighborhood U\u2081 of a and an open neighborhood W\u2081 of X\\V\n   - An open neighborhood U\u2082 of b and an open neighborhood W\u2082 of X\\U\n\n5) Let's look at U\u2081 and U\u2082. These are our candidate neighborhoods. Why do their closures work?\n   - The closure of U\u2081 cannot intersect X\\V (because U\u2081 and W\u2081 are disjoint)\n   - Therefore, the closure of U\u2081 must be contained in V\n   - Similarly, the closure of U\u2082 must be contained in U\n\n6) Since U and V were disjoint to begin with, the closures of U\u2081 and U\u2082 must also be disjoint.\n\nTherefore, U\u2081 and U\u2082 are the neighborhoods we're looking for - their closures are disjoint because they're contained in the original disjoint open sets U and V.\n\nThis proof shows how regularity can be applied twice to construct neighborhoods with the desired property, using the fact that regularity allows us to separate points from closed sets with disjoint open sets.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

To do this, we need to show that any two distinct points in $X_\\alpha$ can be separated by open sets.\n\nTake any two distinct points $x$ and $y$ in $X_\\alpha$. Our goal is to find disjoint open sets in $X_\\alpha$ containing these points. Here's the clever part - we can use the Hausdorff property of the product space to help us.\n\nWe can \"lift\" these points into the product space by creating two points that differ only in the $\\alpha$ coordinate. Since each $X_\\alpha$ is nonempty, we can pick any points for the other coordinates - it doesn't matter what they are as long as they're the same for both lifted points. Let's call this choice of other coordinates $z$.\n\nSo we create two points in the product space:\n- One point has $x$ in the $\\alpha$ coordinate and $z$ everywhere else\n- The other point has $y$ in the $\\alpha$ coordinate and $z$ everywhere else\n\nSince the product space is Hausdorff, these two points can be separated by open sets in the product space. Let's call these separating open sets $U$ and $V$.\n\nBy the properties of product topology, we can find basic open sets (which are products of open sets in each factor) contained in $U$ and $V$. The $\\alpha$ coordinates of these basic open sets give us our desired separating open sets in $X_\\alpha$.\n\nThe key observation is that these open sets in $X_\\alpha$ must be disjoint. If they weren't, we could combine this with our chosen point $z$ in all other coordinates to get a point that lies in both $U$ and $V$, contradicting their disjointness.\n\nSince we can separate any two points in $X_\\alpha$ by open sets, $X_\\alpha$ is Hausdorff.

First, let's consider a product space $\\prod X_\\alpha$ that is normal, and let's pick any particular factor space $X_\\beta$.\n\n2.

Here's the intuitive reasoning:\n\n1) First, we know that X is the union of two closed metrizable subspaces X\u2081 and X\u2082. Being closed in a Hausdorff space means these subspaces are also compact (as closed subsets of compact spaces are compact).\n\n2) A key insight is that metrizable spaces have special properties related to bases and countability. Since X\u2081 and X\u2082 are metrizable, they each have a countable base for their subspace topologies.\n\n3) The strategy will be to use these countable bases to construct a countable base for X. This is possible because:\n   - We only need to consider two subspaces (X\u2081 and X\u2082)\n   - Each subspace has a countable base\n   - The union of two countable collections is countable\n\n4) The fact that X is Hausdorff and compact is crucial because of Urysohn's Metrization Theorem, which states that a regular space with a countable base is metrizable.\n\n5) We can show that X is regular because:\n   - It's Hausdorff (given)\n   - It's compact (given)\n   - Compact Hausdorff spaces are regular\n\n6) The countable base for X can be constructed by:\n   - Taking the countable bases for X\u2081 and X\u2082\n   - Taking finite unions and intersections of these base elements\n   - Using the fact that X\u2081 and X\u2082 are closed to ensure the resulting collection forms a base for X\n\n7) Once we have established that X has a countable base and is regular, Urysohn's Metrization Theorem directly gives us that X is metrizable.\n\nThe key to this proof is recognizing how the metrizability of the subspaces gives us countable bases to work with, and how the compactness and Hausdorff properties allow us to piece these together into a structure that satisfies the conditions for metrizability of the whole space.\nPrevious attempt failed with: expected ';' or line break\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

Here's how it works:\n\n1) First, let's understand what points we need to define our extended function g on. The closure of A (written as \u0100) consists of all points in A plus all limit points of A. For points already in A, we simply define g to equal f. The challenge is defining g at the limit points.\n\n2) For any point x in \u0100 that's not in A, we can find a sequence of points from A that converges to x (this is what it means to be in the closure). Let's call this sequence {x\u2099}.\n\n3) Because f is uniformly continuous on A, when we apply f to this sequence {x\u2099}, we get a Cauchy sequence in Y. Here's why:\n   - Uniform continuity means that points close together in X map to points close together in Y, with the same \"closeness\" bounds working everywhere\n   - As {x\u2099} converges, its terms get arbitrarily close together\n   - Therefore {f(x\u2099)} must also get arbitrarily close together, making it Cauchy\n\n4) Since Y is complete, this Cauchy sequence {f(x\u2099)} must converge to some point in Y. We define g(x) to be this limit.\n\n5) The key is showing this definition makes sense - that is, if we took a different sequence converging to x, we'd get the same limit. This follows from uniform continuity: if two sequences converge to the same point, their terms eventually get arbitrarily close together, so their images under f must also converge to the same limit.\n\n6) For continuity of g, we use the fact that g preserves limits of sequences (by construction), which is equivalent to continuity in metric spaces.\n\n7) For uniform continuity of g, we can use the uniform continuity of f: the same \"epsilon-delta\" bounds that worked for f will work for g because g is defined as limits of values of f.\n\n8) Uniqueness follows because any continuous extension must preserve limits of sequences, and we showed these limits are uniquely determined.\n\nThis construction shows not only that we can extend f to a continuous function on the closure, but that the extension inherits the uniform continuity property and is the only possible continuous extension.\nPrevious attempt failed with: \nPlease revise the proof.",

The key insight is to connect this to the sum of reciprocals of primes, which we know diverges.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1) First, let's understand what square-free integers are - they are numbers that aren't divisible by any perfect square (except 1). In other words, in their prime factorization, each prime appears at most once.\n\n2) Every square-free integer can be written as a product of distinct primes. For example, 30 = 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5 is square-free, while 12 = 2\u00b2 \u00d7 3 is not.\n\n3) We can use the fact that the sum of reciprocals of primes diverges (which is given in the context). Let's call our sum of reciprocals of square-free numbers S.\n\n4) For any prime p, 1/p appears in our sum S since every prime is square-free.\n\n5) Therefore:\n   S \u2265 sum of 1/p over all primes p\n   \n6) Since we know the sum of reciprocals of primes diverges (from the context), and our sum S is greater than or equal to this sum, S must also diverge.\n\n7) More formally, if we had S < \u221e, then we would have a contradiction because:\n   - S contains all terms 1/p where p is prime\n   - The sum of just these terms already diverges\n   - A series containing a divergent subseries must itself diverge\n\nTherefore, the sum of reciprocals of square-free integers must diverge.\n\nThis proof is elegant because it uses a comparison test - we don't need to directly compute the sum, we just need to show it's bigger than something we know diverges. The fact that every prime number is square-free provides the perfect connection to use the known result about the sum of reciprocals of primes.\nPrevious attempt failed with: type mismatch\n  h'\nhas type\n  Summable fun i => 1 / \u2191\u2191i : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  False : Prop\nPlease revise the proof.",

The proof will use contradiction and the properties of derivatives.\n\nSuppose, for the sake of contradiction, that all derivatives of f are non-negative everywhere. That is, assume f^(n)(x) \u2265 0 for all n \u2265 0 and all x \u2208 \u211d.\n\nConsider what this means:\n1. f(0) = 0 and f(1) = 1, so f increases by 1 over the interval [0,1]\n2. f'(x) \u2265 0 everywhere (by our assumption)\n3. f''(x) \u2265 0 everywhere (by our assumption)\n4. And so on for all higher derivatives\n\nBecause f''(x) \u2265 0, f'(x) must be increasing. Because f'(x) is increasing and non-negative, f'(x) must be at least as large for x \u2265 1 as it is in [0,1].\n\nSimilarly, because f'''(x) \u2265 0, f''(x) must be increasing, making f'(x) grow even faster as x increases.\n\nThis pattern continues for all higher derivatives, forcing f(x) to grow faster and faster as x increases. In fact, this would make f(x) grow so rapidly for x > 1 that it would contradict the fact that f is infinitely differentiable.\n\nMore precisely, if all derivatives were non-negative, Taylor's theorem would imply that f(x) would grow faster than any polynomial for x > 1, which is impossible for an infinitely differentiable function that grows by only 1 unit over [0,1].\n\nTherefore, our assumption must be wrong, and there must exist some derivative f^(n) that takes a negative value at some point x.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

This means that for very large n, the expression behaves essentially like \u221a(n\u00b3).\n\n2) \u221a(n\u00b3) = n^(3/2), which is not an integer for most positive integers n.
