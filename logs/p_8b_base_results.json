This means that the function has a well-defined derivative at every point in the domain.\n\nNow, let's consider the imaginary part of $f$, denoted as $\\text{Im}(f)$. We're given that this imaginary part is constant, which implies that its derivative is zero everywhere in $\\Omega$. In other words, $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\text{Im}(f) = 0$ and $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\text{Im}(f) = 0$ for all points $(x, y)$ in $\\Omega$.\n\nSince $f$ is holomorphic, it can be expressed as $f(z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y)$, where $u$ and $v$ are real-valued functions representing the real and imaginary parts of $f$, respectively. The Cauchy-Riemann equations state that for a holomorphic function, the partial derivatives of the real and imaginary parts are related by:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y}$ and $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = -\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x}$\n\nNow, since the derivative of the imaginary part is zero, we have $\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} = 0$ and $\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} = 0$. Substituting these values into the Cauchy-Riemann equations, we get:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = 0$ and $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = 0$\n\nThis implies that the real part $u$ is also constant, since its partial derivatives are zero everywhere in $\\Omega$.\n\nSince both the real and imaginary parts of $f$ are constant, we can conclude that $f$ itself is constant.

The series is a geometric series with the common ratio $z$, but it's multiplied by the term $n$, which is an increasing sequence of positive integers.\n\nWhen we consider the series on the unit circle, we know that $|z| = 1$. This means that the terms of the series are not decreasing in magnitude, as they would be if we were dealing with a standard geometric series. In fact, the terms are increasing in magnitude because of the factor $n$.\n\nTo see why the series does not converge, let's consider the partial sums of the series. The partial sum $S_n$ is given by:\n\n$S_n = \\sum_{k=1}^n k z^k$\n\nWe can rewrite this as:\n\n$S_n = z + 2z^2 + 3z^3 + \\ldots + nz^n$\n\nNow, let's consider the absolute value of the partial sum, $|S_n|$. We can use the triangle inequality to bound $|S_n|$ from below:\n\n$|S_n| \\geq |nz^n| - |(n-1)z^{n-1}| - \\ldots - |z|$\n\nSince $|z| = 1$, we can simplify this to:\n\n$|S_n| \\geq n - (n-1) - \\ldots - 1$\n\nThis is a sum of $n$ terms, each of which is at least 1. Therefore, we have:\n\n$|S_n| \\geq n$\n\nThis shows that the partial sums of the series are increasing in magnitude without bound. In other words, the series is divergent.\n\nSince the partial sums are increasing in magnitude without bound, the series cannot converge to any finite limit. Therefore, we conclude that the power series $\\sum nz^n$ does not converge on any point of the unit circle.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the

This means that the series is of the form $\\sum a_n z^n$, where $a_n = \\frac{1}{n}$.\n\nNext, we can use the ratio test to determine the convergence of the series. The ratio test states that a series $\\sum a_n$ converges if the limit of $\\left| \\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} \\right|$ as $n$ approaches infinity is less than 1.\n\nIn this case, we have $a_n = \\frac{1}{n}$, so we can calculate the limit of $\\left| \\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} \\right|$ as follows:\n\n$\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left| \\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} \\right| = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left| \\frac{\\frac{1}{n+1}}{\\frac{1}{n}} \\right| = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left| \\frac{n}{n+1} \\right| = 1$\n\nSince the limit is equal to 1, the ratio test is inconclusive, and we need to use another method to determine the convergence of the series.\n\nOne way to approach this is to consider the series $\\sum \\frac{z^n}{n}$ as a geometric series with common ratio $z$. A geometric series converges if the absolute value of the common ratio is less than 1.\n\nHowever, in this case, we are considering the series on the unit circle, where $|z| = 1$. This means that the absolute value of the common ratio is equal to 1, and the geometric series does not converge in the classical sense.\n\nHowever, we can still use the properties of the geometric series to determine the convergence of the series $\\sum \\frac{z^n}{n}$. Specifically, we can use the fact that the sum of a geometric series is given by $\\frac{a}{1 - r}$, where $a$ is the first term and $r$ is the common ratio.\n\nIn this case, the first term is $a = 1$, and the common ratio is $r = z$. However, since $|z| = 1$, the series does not converge in the classical sense.\n\nBut, we can still consider the series $\\sum \\frac{z^n}{n}$ as a limit of a sequence of partial sums. Specifically, we can consider the sequence of partial sums $S_n = \\sum_{k=0}^n \\frac{z^k}{k}$.\n\nUsing the properties of the geometric series, we can show that the sequence of partial sums $S_n$ converges to a limit $S$ as $n$ approaches infinity.\n\nTo see this, we can use the fact that the sum of a geometric series is given by $\\frac{a}{1 - r}$. In this case, we have $a = 1$ and $r = z$, so we can write:\n\n$S_n = \\sum_{k=0}^n \\frac{z^k}{k} = \\frac{1}{1 - z} \\sum_{k=0}^n z^k$\n\nUsing the formula for the sum of a geometric series, we can rewrite this as:\n\n$S_n = \\frac{1}{1 - z} \\frac{1 - z^{n+1}}{1 - z} = \\frac{1 - z^{n+1}}{1 - z}$\n\nNow, we can take the limit of $S_n$ as $n$ approaches infinity:\n\n$\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} S_n = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{1 - z^{n+1}}{1 - z}$\n\nSince $|z| = 1$, we have $z^{n+1} \\to 0$ as $n$ approaches infinity. Therefore, we can rewrite the limit as:\n\n$\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} S_n = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{1 - 0}{1 - z} = \\frac{1}{1 - z}$\n\nThis shows that the sequence of partial sums $S_n$ converges to the limit $S = \\frac{1}{1 - z}$ as $n$ approaches infinity.\n\nHowever, we need to be careful here. The limit $S = \\frac{1}{1 - z}$ is only valid if $z \\neq 1$. If $z = 1$, then the series $\\sum \\frac{z^n}{n}$ does not converge.\n\nTo see this, we can consider the sequence of partial sums $S_n$ for $z = 1$. In this case, we have:\n\n$S_n = \\sum_{k=0}^n \\frac{1^k}{k} = \\sum_{k=0}^n \\frac{1}{k}$\n\nThis is the harmonic series, which is known to diverge. Therefore, the sequence of partial sums $S_n$ does not converge for $z = 1$.\n\nIn conclusion, we have shown that the power series $\\sum \\frac{z^n}{n}$ converges at every point of the unit circle except $z = 1$. This is because the sequence of partial sums $S_n$ converges to the limit $S = \\frac{1}{1 - z}$ for $z \\neq 1$, but diverges for $z = 1$.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

Since $\\frac{x \\sin x}{x^2 + a^2}$ is an odd function (i.e., $f(-x) = -f(x)$), we can rewrite the given integral as $2 \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{x \\sin x}{x^2 + a^2} dx$.\n\nNext, we'll use a technique called contour integration, which involves integrating a complex-valued function over a closed curve in the complex plane. We'll consider the function $f(z) = \\frac{z \\sin z}{z^2 + a^2}$, where $z$ is a complex number.\n\nWe'll integrate $f(z)$ over a semicircular contour that consists of the real axis from $-R$ to $R$ and a semicircle $\\Gamma$ of radius $R$ in the upper half-plane. As $R$ approaches infinity, the integral over the semicircle $\\Gamma$ approaches zero due to Jordan's lemma.\n\nUsing the residue theorem, we can evaluate the integral over the semicircular contour as $2 \\pi i$ times the sum of the residues of $f(z)$ at the poles inside the contour. The only pole of $f(z)$ is at $z = ai$, which is inside the contour.\n\nTo find the residue at $z = ai$, we'll use the formula for the residue of a simple pole: $\\text{Res}(f(z), z_0) = \\lim_{z \\to z_0} (z - z_0) f(z)$. After some algebraic manipulations, we'll find that the residue at $z = ai$ is $e^{-a}$.\n\nTherefore, the integral over the semicircular contour is $2 \\pi i e^{-a}$. Since the integral over the real axis from $-R$ to $R$ is equal to the given integral, we can equate the two expressions and obtain $2 \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{x \\sin x}{x^2 + a^2} dx = 2 \\pi i e^{-a}$.\n\nFinally, we'll use the fact that the integral of an even function over the entire real line is equal to twice the integral of the function over the non-negative real line to obtain the desired result: $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{x \\sin x}{x^2 + a^2} dx = \\pi e^{-a}$.\n\nNote that this proof relies on the residue theorem and contour integration, which are advanced techniques in complex analysis.

An injective function is a function that maps distinct elements of its domain to distinct elements of its range. In other words, if $f(z_1) = f(z_2)$, then $z_1 = z_2$. This means that the function is one-to-one.\n\nTo prove that the function takes the form $f(z) = az + b$, we'll use the fact that the function is injective and entire. Let's consider two distinct points $z_1$ and $z_2$ in the complex plane. Since the function is injective, we know that $f(z_1) \\neq f(z_2)$.\n\nNow, let's consider the difference $f(z_1) - f(z_2)$. Since the function is entire, we can represent this difference as a power series:\n\n$$f(z_1) - f(z_2) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} c_n (z_1^n - z_2^n)$$\n\nSince the function is injective, we know that $f(z_1) - f(z_2) \\neq 0$. This means that the power series cannot be identically zero.\n\nRecall that the difference of two complex numbers can be represented as a product of the two numbers. Specifically, we have:\n\n$$z_1^n - z_2^n = (z_1 - z_2)(z_1^{n-1} + z_1^{n-2}z_2 + \\cdots + z_2^{n-1})$$\n\nUsing this fact, we can rewrite the power series as:\n\n$$f(z_1) - f(z_2) = (z_1 - z_2) \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} c_n (z_1^{n-1} + z_1^{n-2}z_2 + \\cdots + z_2^{n-1})$$\n\nSince the power series cannot be identically zero, we know that the coefficient of the term $(z_1 - z_2)$ must be non-zero. This means that there exists a constant $a$ such that:\n\n$$\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} c_n (z_1^{n-1} + z_1^{n-2}z_2 + \\cdots + z_2^{n-1}) = a$$\n\nNow, let's consider the function $f(z) - az$. Since the function is entire, we can represent this function as a power series:\n\n$$f(z) - az = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} c_n z^n - az$$\n\nUsing the fact that the coefficient of the term $(z_1 - z_2)$ is non-zero, we know that the function $f(z) - az$ must be a constant. This means that there exists a constant $b$ such that:\n\n$$f(z) - az = b$$\n\nCombining the two equations, we get:\n\n$$f(z) = az + b$$\n\nwhere $a, b \\in \\mathbb{C}$ and $a \\neq 0$.

Since $f$ is holomorphic in the unit disc, it can be represented by a power series centered at the origin. This power series is given by $f(z) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n z^n$, where $a_n$ are the coefficients of the power series.\n\nSince $f$ is not identically zero, there exists at least one non-zero coefficient $a_n$. Furthermore, since $f$ is bounded, the coefficients $a_n$ must decrease in magnitude as $n$ increases. This is because the power series of a bounded function must have coefficients that decrease in magnitude.\n\nNow, let's consider the zeros of $f$, denoted by $z_n$. Since $f$ is holomorphic in the unit disc, the zeros of $f$ must be isolated, meaning that there are no zeros on the boundary of the unit disc. This is a consequence of the Identity Theorem, which states that if a holomorphic function has a zero on the boundary of its domain, then it must be identically zero.\n\nSince the zeros of $f$ are isolated, we can use the fact that the distance between consecutive zeros must be bounded away from zero. This is because if the distance between consecutive zeros were to approach zero, then the function would have a zero on the boundary of the unit disc, which contradicts the fact that $f$ is holomorphic in the unit disc.\n\nNow, let's consider the series $\\sum_{n}\\left(1-\\left|z_{n}\\right|\\right)$. We can rewrite this series as $\\sum_{n}\\left(1-\\left|z_{n}\\right|\\right) = \\sum_{n} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\left|1/z_n\\right|}\\right)$.

Now, if we assume that i \u2264 0, then by additivity, we would have i + i \u2264 0 + i, which simplifies to 2i \u2264 i. This implies that i \u2264 0, which is a contradiction since i is not equal to 0.\n\nOn the other hand, if we assume that i \u2265 0, then by additivity, we would have i + i \u2265 0 + i, which simplifies to 2i \u2265 i. This implies that i \u2265 0, which is again a contradiction since i is not equal to 0.\n\nSince both assumptions lead to contradictions, we conclude that i cannot be compared to 0 using the order \u2264. However, this is not a problem in itself, as we can simply define the order \u2264 to be such that i is not comparable to 0.\n\nThe real problem arises when we consider the complex number -i.

Then, for any $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, there exist points $x_n \\in A$ and $y_n \\in B$ such that $d(x_n, y_n) < \\frac{1}{n}$. \n\nSince $A$ is closed, it contains all its limit points. Let $x$ be a limit point of $A$. Then, there exists a sequence $\\{x_n\\}$ in $A$ such that $x_n \\to x$. \n\nSince $d(x_n, y_n) < \\frac{1}{n}$, we have that $y_n \\to x$ as well. \n\nBut this is a problem, because $x \\in A$ and $y_n \\in B$ for all $n$. This means that $x \\in B$, since $B$ is closed and contains all its limit points. \n\nHowever, this is a contradiction, because $A$ and $B$ are disjoint, and we have just shown that $x \\in A \\cap B$. \n\nTherefore, our assumption that $A$ and $B$ are not separated must be false. This means that $A$ and $B$ are indeed separated.\n\nIn other words, since $A$ and $B$ are disjoint closed sets, there exists a positive distance between them, i.e., $\\inf\\{d(x, y) : x \\in A, y \\in B\\} > 0$.\nPrevious attempt failed with: invalid constructor \u27e8...\u27e9, insufficient number of arguments, constructs 'Exists.intro' has #2 explicit fields, but only #1 provided\nno goals to be solved\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: type mismatch\n  disjoint_left.mp ?m.2443 ?m.2486 ?m.2509\nhas type\n  False : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  x \u2209 B : Prop\napplication type mismatch\n  disjoint_left.mp ?m.2443 ?m.2486 hy\nargument\n  hy\nhas type\n  y \u2208 B : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  y \u2208 ?m.2396 : Prop\nunknown identifier 'separatedNhds_of_disjoint'\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  Fintype X\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\ntype mismatch\n  fun x hx y hy => ?m.5160 x hx y hy\nhas type\n  (x : X) \u2192\n    (hx : ?m.5156 x) \u2192\n      (y : ?m.5157 x hx) \u2192\n        (hy : ?m.5158 x hx y) \u2192 ?m.5159 x hx y hy : Sort (imax (u_1 + 1) ?u.2691 ?u.2694 ?u.2697 ?u.5153)\nbut is expected to have type\n  Set X : Type u_1\napplication type mismatch\n  Metric.isOpen_iff.mp isOpen_univ y (mem_univ y)\nargument\n  mem_univ y\nhas type\n  y \u2208 univ : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  y \u2208 Set.univ : Prop\ninvalid constructor \u27e8...\u27e9, expected type must be an inductive type \n  ?m.13247\ntactic 'cases' failed, nested error:\ntactic 'induction' failed, recursor 'Exists.casesOn' can only eliminate into Prop\nX : Type u_1\ninst\u271d : MetricSpace X\nx : X\nhx : ?m.5156 x\ny : ?m.5157 x hx\nhy : ?m.5158 x hx y\nmotive : (\u2203 \u03b5 > 0, Metric.ball x \u03b5 \u2286 Set.univ) \u2192 Sort ?u.14209\nh_1 : (\u03b5 : \u211d) \u2192 (h\u03b5 : \u03b5 > 0 \u2227 Metric.ball x \u03b5 \u2286 Set.univ) \u2192 motive \u22ef\nx\u271d : \u2203 \u03b5 > 0, Metric.ball x \u03b5 \u2286 Set.univ\n\u22a2 motive x\u271d after processing\n  _\nthe dependent pattern matcher can solve the following kinds of equations\n- <var> = <term> and <term> = <var>\n- <term> = <term> where the terms are definitionally equal\n- <constructor> = <constructor>, examples: List.cons x xs = List.cons y ys, and List.cons x xs = List.nil\nunsolved goals\ncase h\nX : Type u_1\ninst\u271d : MetricSpace X\nA B : Set X\nhA : IsClosed A\nhB : IsClosed B\nhAB : Disjoint A B\n\u22a2 \u2203 V, IsOpen (sorryAx (Set X) true) \u2227 IsOpen V \u2227 A \u2286 sorryAx (Set X) true \u2227 B \u2286 V \u2227 Disjoint (sorryAx (Set X) true) V\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "# Informal Proof:\n\nTo prove that every compact metric space $K$ has a countable base, we'll start by considering the properties of compact metric spaces. A key property of compact spaces is that they are totally bounded, meaning that for any positive real number $\\epsilon$, there exists a finite number of open balls of radius $\\epsilon$ that cover the entire space.\n\nNow, let's consider the set of all open balls in $K$ with rational radii. This set is countable because the set of rational numbers is countable, and we can list out all the possible radii and centers of the open balls. We can then define a collection of open balls, $\\mathcal{B}$, to be the set of all open balls in $K$ with rational radii.\n\nNext, we'll show that $\\mathcal{B}$ is a base for the topology on $K$. To do this, we need to show that for any open set $U$ in $K$ and any point $x \\in U$, there exists a ball $B \\in \\mathcal{B}$ such that $x \\in B \\subseteq U$. \n\nLet $U$ be an open set in $K$ and $x \\in U$. Since $U$ is open, there exists an open ball $B(x, r)$ such that $x \\in B(x, r) \\subseteq U$. Now, since $K$ is compact, we can find a finite number of open balls of radius $\\frac{r}{2}$ that cover the entire space. Let $B_1, B_2, ..., B_n$ be these open balls. \n\nSince $B(x, r)$ is one of these open balls, we can find a rational number $q$ such that $\\frac{r}{2} < q < r$. Then, we can find a ball $B \\in \\mathcal{B}$ such that $x \\in B \\subseteq B(x, q) \\subseteq B(x, r) \\subseteq U$. This shows that $\\mathcal{B}$ is a base for the topology on $K$.\n\nFinally, we need to show that $\\mathcal{B}$ is countable. Since we defined $\\mathcal{B}$ to be the set of all open balls in $K$ with rational radii, and the set of rational numbers is countable, it follows that $\\mathcal{B}$ is also countable.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that every compact metric space $K$ has a countable base, given by the collection of open balls with rational radii.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unexpected token ','; expected '}'\nunsolved goals\nK : Type u_1\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : MetricSpace K\ninst\u271d : CompactSpace K\n\u22a2 \u2203 B, B.Countable \u2227 IsTopologicalBasis B\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unexpected token ','; expected '}'\nunsolved goals\nK : Type u_1\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : MetricSpace K\ninst\u271d : CompactSpace K\n\u22a2 \u2203 B, B.Countable \u2227 IsTopologicalBasis B\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'ball'\ntype mismatch\n  Set.countable_setOf_finite_subset (Set.countable_range ?m.893)\nhas type\n  {t | t.Finite \u2227 t \u2286 Set.range ?m.893}.Countable : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  B.Countable : Prop\nunknown identifier 'isOpen_ball'\nrcases tactic failed: hs : s x is not an inductive datatype\nPlease revise the proof.",

A point $x$ in a subset $E$ of $\\mathbb{R}^k$ is called a condensation point if every open neighborhood of $x$ contains uncountably many points of $E$. In other words, no matter how small an open ball we draw around $x$, it will contain an uncountable number of points from $E$.\n\nNow, let's consider the set $P$ of all condensation points of $E$. We want to show that at most countably many points of $E$ are not in $P$. To do this, we'll use a proof by contradiction.\n\nAssume that there are uncountably many points of $E$ that are not in $P$. This means that there exists a subset $F$ of $E$ such that $F$ is uncountable and $F \\cap P = \\emptyset$. Since $E$ is uncountable, we can find a point $x \\in F$.\n\nNow, consider an open ball $B$ around $x$ with radius $r > 0$. Since $x$ is not a condensation point, there exists an open ball $B'$ around $x$ such that $B' \\cap E$ is countable. We can choose $r$ small enough so that $B' \\subset B$.\n\nSince $F$ is uncountable, there exists a point $y \\in F$ such that $y \\in B'$. But then, $y$ is in the open ball $B'$, which is countable, and therefore $y$ is not a condensation point. This means that $y \\in P$, which is a contradiction since we assumed that $F \\cap P = \\emptyset$.\n\nTherefore, our assumption that there are uncountably many points of $E$ that are not in $P$ must be false.

This is a fundamental property of open sets in $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nNow, for each point $x$ in $U$, let's define a segment $S_x$ as the intersection of the open interval $(x - \\epsilon_x, x + \\epsilon_x)$ with the set $U$. In other words, $S_x = (x - \\epsilon_x, x + \\epsilon_x) \\cap U$. \n\nNotice that each segment $S_x$ is a non-empty, open interval that is entirely contained within $U$. Moreover, the segments $S_x$ are pairwise disjoint, meaning that no two segments have any points in common.\n\nNext, let's consider the collection of all segments $S_x$ for $x$ in $U$. Since each segment $S_x$ is a non-empty, open interval, we can associate a unique real number with each segment, namely its midpoint. Let's denote the set of midpoints of all segments $S_x$ as $M$.\n\nThe set $M$ is a subset of $\\mathbb{R}$, and since each segment $S_x$ is a non-empty, open interval, the set $M$ is also countable. This is because we can put the segments in a one-to-one correspondence with the real numbers, by associating each segment with its midpoint.\n\nNow, let's consider the union of all segments $S_x$ for $x$ in $U$. This union is precisely the set $U$, since each point $x$ in $U$ belongs to the segment $S_x$.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that the open set $U$ is the union of an at most countable collection of disjoint segments, namely the segments $S_x$ for $x$ in $U$.

This is a good starting point because it allows us to see the expression as a difference between a square root and a simple term.\n\nNext, we can multiply and divide the expression by the conjugate of the numerator, which is $\\sqrt{n(n + 1)} + n$. This is a common technique used to eliminate the square root in the numerator.\n\nBy multiplying and dividing by the conjugate, we get:\n\n$\\sqrt{n(n + 1)} - n = \\frac{(\\sqrt{n(n + 1)} - n)(\\sqrt{n(n + 1)} + n)}{\\sqrt{n(n + 1)} + n}$\n\nSimplifying the numerator, we get:\n\n$\\frac{n(n + 1) - n^2}{\\sqrt{n(n + 1)} + n}$\n\nExpanding the numerator, we get:\n\n$\\frac{n^2 + n - n^2}{\\sqrt{n(n + 1)} + n}$\n\nSimplifying the numerator further, we get:\n\n$\\frac{n}{\\sqrt{n(n + 1)} + n}$\n\nNow, we can simplify the expression by dividing the numerator and denominator by $n$.

This means that $\\limsup (a_n + b_n) \\leq \\limsup a_n + \\limsup b_n$, as required.\n\nNote that we have assumed that the sum on the right is not of the form $\\infty - \\infty$.

We have a sequence of closed, nonempty, and bounded sets $\\left\\{E_{n}\\right\\}$ in a complete metric space $X$. The sets are nested, meaning that each set $E_{n}$ is a superset of the next set $E_{n+1}$. Additionally, we know that the diameter of each set $E_{n}$ approaches 0 as $n$ approaches infinity.\n\nOur goal is to show that the intersection of all these sets, denoted as $\\bigcap_{1}^{\\infty} E_{n}$, consists of exactly one point.\n\nFirst, let's consider the fact that the sets are nested. This means that the intersection of the first $n$ sets, denoted as $\\bigcap_{1}^{n} E_{i}$, is equal to $E_{n}$ for any positive integer $n$. This is because each set $E_{n}$ is a superset of the previous sets, so the intersection of the first $n$ sets will always be the last set in the sequence.\n\nNow, let's consider the diameter of the sets. We know that the diameter of each set $E_{n}$ approaches 0 as $n$ approaches infinity. This means that the distance between any two points in the set $E_{n}$ is getting arbitrarily small as $n$ increases.\n\nSince the sets are nested, the intersection of the first $n$ sets, $\\bigcap_{1}^{n} E_{i}$, is equal to $E_{n}$. As $n$ increases, the diameter of $E_{n}$ approaches 0, which means that the distance between any two points in $E_{n}$ is getting arbitrarily small.\n\nNow, let's consider two points $x$ and $y$ that are in the intersection of all the sets, $\\bigcap_{1}^{\\infty} E_{n}$. Since $x$ and $y$ are in the intersection, they are both in each of the sets $E_{n}$ for all positive integers $n$.\n\nAs $n$ increases, the diameter of $E_{n}$ approaches 0, which means that the distance between $x$ and $y$ is getting arbitrarily small. This is true for any two points $x$ and $y$ in the intersection.\n\nHowever, if the intersection consisted of more than one point, then there would be at least two points $x$ and $y$ in the intersection, and the distance between them would not be 0. This is a contradiction, since we know that the distance between any two points in the intersection is getting arbitrarily small as $n$ increases.\n\nTherefore, the intersection of all the sets, $\\bigcap_{1}^{\\infty} E_{n}$, can only consist of one point. This is because if it consisted of more than one point, then there would be at least two points in the intersection, and the distance between them would not be 0, which is a contradiction.\n\nIn conclusion, the intersection of all the sets, $\\bigcap_{1}^{\\infty} E_{n}$, consists of exactly one point.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

We can define a function $f: E \\to \\mathbb{R}$ as follows:\n\n$$f(x) = \\begin{cases} 0 & \\text{if } x \\in (0, 1) \\text{ is irrational} \\\\ 1 & \\text{if } x \\in (0, 1) \\text{ is rational} \\end{cases}$$\n\nThis function $f$ is continuous on $E$ because it is constant on the set of irrational numbers and the set of rational numbers, both of which are dense in $E$. In other words, for any $x \\in E$, there are irrational and rational numbers arbitrarily close to $x$, so the value of $f(x)$ is determined by the values of $f$ at these nearby points.\n\nNow, suppose that there exists a continuous function $g: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ such that $g(x) = f(x)$ for all $x \\in E$. We will show that this leads to a contradiction.\n\nSince $g$ is continuous on $\\mathbb{R}$, it must be continuous at the point $x = 0$. By the definition of continuity, this means that for any $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists a $\\delta > 0$ such that $|g(x) - g(0)| < \\epsilon$ whenever $|x - 0| < \\delta$. In particular, we can choose $\\epsilon = 1/2$ and find a corresponding $\\delta > 0$.\n\nNow, consider the rational number $x = \\delta/2$. Since $x \\in E$, we have $g(x) = f(x) = 1$. On the other hand, since $x$ is close to $0$, we have $|x - 0| < \\delta$, so $|g(x) - g(0)| < 1/2$. This implies that $g(0) > 1/2$.\n\nSimilarly, consider the irrational number $x = \\delta/2 + \\sqrt{2}/2$. Since $x \\in E$, we have $g(x) = f(x) = 0$. On the other hand, since $x$ is close to $0$, we have $|x - 0| < \\delta$, so $|g(x) - g(0)| < 1/2$. This implies that $g(0) < 1/2$.\n\nWe have reached a contradiction, since $g(0)$ cannot be both greater than $1/2$ and less than $1/2$ at the same time. Therefore, our assumption that there exists a continuous function $g: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ such that $g(x) = f(x)$ for all $x \\in E$ must be false.\n\nThis shows that there exists a set $E \\subset \\mathbb{R}$ and a real continuous function $f$ defined on $E$, such that there does not exist a continuous real function $g$ on $\\mathbb{R}$ such that $g(x) = f(x)$ for all $x \\in E$.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  Membership \u211d (Finset \u2115)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\ninvalid field 'isRat', the environment does not contain 'Real.isRat'\n  x\nhas type\n  \u211d\napplication type mismatch\n  ContinuousOn f E\nargument\n  E\nhas type\n  Finset \u2115 : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  Set \u211d : Type\ninvalid field 'exists_pos_forall_lt', the environment does not contain 'ContinuousAt.exists_pos_forall_lt'\n  h_cont_at_zero\nhas type\n  ContinuousAt g 0\ninvalid field 'exists_pos_forall_lt', the environment does not contain 'Filter.Tendsto.exists_pos_forall_lt'\n  h_cont_at_zero\nhas type\n  Tendsto g (\ud835\udcdd 0) (\ud835\udcdd (g 0))\ninvalid field 'exists_pos_forall_lt', the environment does not contain 'LE.le.exists_pos_forall_lt'\n  h_cont_at_zero\nhas type\n  Filter.map g (\ud835\udcdd 0) \u2264 \ud835\udcdd (g 0)\ninvalid field notation, type is not of the form (C ...) where C is a constant\n  h_cont_at_zero\nhas type\n  ?m.4230 \u2208 \ud835\udcdd (g 0) \u2192 ?m.4230 \u2208 Filter.map g (\ud835\udcdd 0)\nrcases tactic failed: x\u271d : ?m.4232 is not an inductive datatype\napplication type mismatch\n  Exists.intro E\nargument\n  E\nhas type\n  Finset \u2115 : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  Set \u211d : Type\nPlease revise the proof.",

A function $f$ is open if for every open set $U$ in the domain, the image $f(U)$ is also open in the codomain. In other words, $f$ maps open sets to open sets.\n\nNow, let's assume that $f$ is not monotonic. This means that there exist two points $x_1$ and $x_2$ in the domain such that $x_1 < x_2$, but $f(x_1) > f(x_2)$.\n\nWe can use this assumption to construct a contradiction. Consider the open interval $(x_1, x_2)$ in the domain. Since $f$ is continuous, the image $f((x_1, x_2))$ is also open in the codomain.\n\nHowever, since $f$ is not monotonic, there exist two points $y_1$ and $y_2$ in the image $f((x_1, x_2))$ such that $y_1 < y_2$, but $f^{-1}(y_1) > f^{-1}(y_2)$. This implies that there exist two points $z_1$ and $z_2$ in the domain $(x_1, x_2)$ such that $z_1 < z_2$, but $f(z_1) > f(z_2)$.\n\nNow, consider the open interval $(z_1, z_2)$ in the domain. Since $f$ is continuous, the image $f((z_1, z_2))$ is also open in the codomain. However, this image is a subset of the image $f((x_1, x_2))$, which is open. This means that the image $f((z_1, z_2))$ is also open.\n\nBut this is a contradiction, since the image $f((z_1, z_2))$ is a closed interval (because $f$ is continuous and the domain is an open interval), and it cannot be open.\n\nTherefore, our assumption that $f$ is not monotonic must be false, and we conclude that every continuous open mapping of $R^{1}$ into $R^{1}$ is monotonic.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

This is because if there were no such distance, then $K$ and $F$ would intersect, which contradicts the fact that they are disjoint.\n\nNow, let's assume that there is no such $\\delta$.

We want to show that $f(x_1) \\neq f(x_2)$. \n\nSince $f(x) = x + \\varepsilon g(x)$, we can write $f(x_1) = x_1 + \\varepsilon g(x_1)$ and $f(x_2) = x_2 + \\varepsilon g(x_2)$. \n\nNow, let's consider the difference between $f(x_1)$ and $f(x_2)$: $f(x_1) - f(x_2) = (x_1 + \\varepsilon g(x_1)) - (x_2 + \\varepsilon g(x_2))$. \n\nExpanding this expression, we get $f(x_1) - f(x_2) = x_1 - x_2 + \\varepsilon g(x_1) - \\varepsilon g(x_2)$. \n\nSince $x_1 \\neq x_2$, we have $x_1 - x_2 \\neq 0$. \n\nNow, let's consider the term $\\varepsilon g(x_1) - \\varepsilon g(x_2)$. We can factor out $\\varepsilon$ to get $\\varepsilon (g(x_1) - g(x_2))$. \n\nSince $g$ has a bounded derivative, we know that $\\left|g^{\\prime}\\right| \\leq M$. This means that the difference between $g(x_1)$ and $g(x_2)$ is bounded by $M$ times the difference between $x_1$ and $x_2$. \n\nMore precisely, we have $\\left|g(x_1) - g(x_2)\\right| \\leq M \\left|x_1 - x_2\\right|$. \n\nNow, let's go back to the expression $\\varepsilon (g(x_1) - g(x_2))$. We can bound this expression by $\\left|\\varepsilon\\right| M \\left|x_1 - x_2\\right|$. \n\nSince $\\varepsilon$ is a fixed positive number, we can write $\\left|\\varepsilon\\right| = \\varepsilon$. \n\nSo, we have $\\varepsilon (g(x_1) -

x_2 + \\varepsilon M \\left|x_1 - x_2\\right|$. \n\nSince $x_1 - x_2 \\neq 0$, we can divide both sides of this inequality by $\\left|x_1 - x_2\\right|$. \n\nThis gives us $1 + \\varepsilon M \\leq \\frac{f(x_1) - f(x_2)}{\\left|x_1 - x_2\\right|}$. \n\nSince $\\varepsilon$ is a fixed positive number, we can make $\\varepsilon M$ as small as we want by choosing $\\varepsilon$ to be small enough. \n\nIn particular, we can choose $\\varepsilon$ to be so small that $\\varepsilon M < 1$. \n\nThis means that $1 + \\varepsilon M < 2$. \n\nNow, let's go back to the inequality $1 + \\varepsilon M \\leq \\frac{f(x_1) - f(x_2)}{\\left|x_1 - x_2\\right|}$. \n\nWe can rewrite this inequality as $\\frac{f(x_1) - f(x_2)}{\\left|x_1 - x_2\\right|} \\geq 1$. \n\nThis means that $\\left|\\frac{f(x_1) - f(x_2)}{\\left|x_1 -

f(x_2) = x_1 - x_2 + \\varepsilon (g(x_1) - g(x_2))$, we know that $f(x_1) - f(x_2)$ has the same sign as $x_1 - x_2$. \n\nThis means that $\\frac{f(x_1) - f(x_2)}{\\left|x_1 - x_2\\right|}$ has the same sign as 1. \n\nTherefore, we must have $\\frac{f(x_1) - f(x_2)}{\\left|x_1 - x_2\\right|} > 1$. \n\nThis means that $f(x_1) - f(x_2) > \\left|x_1 - x_2\\right|$. \n\nSince $f(x_1) - f(x_2) > \\left|x_1 - x_2\\right|$, we know that $f(x_1) \\neq f(x_2)$. \n\nThis completes the proof that $f$ is one-to-one if $\\varepsilon$ is small enough.\nPrevious attempt failed with: linarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase h1.h\ng : \u211d \u2192 \u211d\nhg : Continuous g\nM : \u211d\nhM : \u2200 (x : \u211d), |deriv g x| \u2264 M\n\u03b5 : \u211d\nh\u03b5 : \u03b5 > 0\nh\u03b5' : \u03b5 < 1 / (M + 1)\nx\u2081 x\u2082 : \u211d\nh : (fun x => x + \u03b5 * g x) x\u2081 = (fun x => x + \u03b5 * g x) x\u2082\na\u271d : \u03b5 * g x\u2081 < \u03b5 * g x\u2082\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase h1.h\ng : \u211d \u2192 \u211d\nhg : Continuous g\nM : \u211d\nhM : \u2200 (x : \u211d), |deriv g x| \u2264 M\n\u03b5 : \u211d\nh\u03b5 : \u03b5 > 0\nh\u03b5' : \u03b5 < 1 / (M + 1)\nx\u2081 x\u2082 : \u211d\nh : (fun x => x + \u03b5 * g x) x\u2081 = (fun x => x + \u03b5 * g x) x\u2082\nh' : \u03b5 * g x\u2081 = \u03b5 * g x\u2082\na\u271d : g x\u2081 < g x\u2082\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase h1.h\ng : \u211d \u2192 \u211d\nhg : Continuous g\nM : \u211d\nhM : \u2200 (x : \u211d), |deriv g x| \u2264 M\n\u03b5 : \u211d\nh\u03b5 : \u03b5 > 0\nh\u03b5' : \u03b5 < 1 / (M + 1)\nx\u2081 x\u2082 : \u211d\nh : (fun x => x + \u03b5 * g x) x\u2081 = (fun x => x + \u03b5 * g x) x\u2082\nh' : \u03b5 * g x\u2081 = \u03b5 * g x\u2082\nh'' : g x\u2081 = g x\u2082\na\u271d : deriv g x\u2081 < deriv g x\u2082\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase h1.h\ng : \u211d \u2192 \u211d\nhg : Continuous g\nM : \u211d\nhM : \u2200 (x : \u211d), |deriv g x| \u2264 M\n\u03b5 : \u211d\nh\u03b5 : \u03b5 > 0\nh\u03b5' : \u03b5 < 1 / (M + 1)\nx\u2081 x\u2082 : \u211d\nh : (fun x => x + \u03b5 * g x) x\u2081 = (fun x => x + \u03b5 * g x) x\u2082\nh' : \u03b5 * g x\u2081 = \u03b5 * g x\u2082\nh'' : g x\u2081 = g x\u2082\nh'''' : deriv g x\u2081 = deriv g x\u2082\nh''''' : |deriv g x\u2081| \u2264 M\nh'''''' : |deriv g x\u2082| \u2264 M\na\u271d : |deriv g x\u2081| < |deriv g x\u2082|\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\ntactic 'apply' failed, failed to unify\n  ?m.4324 = ?m.4325 \u2228 ?m.4324 = -?m.4325\nwith\n  deriv g x\u2081 = deriv g x\u2082\ng : \u211d \u2192 \u211d\nhg : Continuous g\nM : \u211d\nhM : \u2200 (x : \u211d), |deriv g x| \u2264 M\n\u03b5 : \u211d\nh\u03b5 : \u03b5 > 0\nh\u03b5' : \u03b5 < 1 / (M + 1)\nx\u2081 x\u2082 : \u211d\nh : (fun x => x + \u03b5 * g x) x\u2081 = (fun x => x + \u03b5 * g x) x\u2082\nh' : \u03b5 * g x\u2081 = \u03b5 * g x\u2082\nh'' : g x\u2081 = g x\u2082\nh'''' : deriv g x\u2081 = deriv g x\u2082\nh''''' : |deriv g x\u2081| \u2264 M\nh'''''' : |deriv g x\u2082| \u2264 M\nh''''''' : |deriv g x\u2081| = |deriv g x\u2082|\n\u22a2 deriv g x\u2081 = deriv g x\u2082\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase h1.h\ng : \u211d \u2192 \u211d\nhg : Continuous g\nM : \u211d\nhM : \u2200 (x : \u211d), |deriv g x| \u2264 M\n\u03b5 : \u211d\nh\u03b5 : \u03b5 > 0\nh\u03b5' : \u03b5 < 1 / (M + 1)\nx\u2081 x\u2082 : \u211d\nh : (fun x => x + \u03b5 * g x) x\u2081 = (fun x => x + \u03b5 * g x) x\u2082\nh' : \u03b5 * g x\u2081 = \u03b5 * g x\u2082\nh'' : g x\u2081 = g x\u2082\nh'''' : deriv g x\u2081 = deriv g x\u2082\nh''''' : |deriv g x\u2081| \u2264 M\nh'''''' : |deriv g x\u2082| \u2264 M\nh''''''' : |deriv g x\u2081| = |deriv g x\u2082|\nh'''''''' : deriv g x\u2081 = deriv g x\u2082\na\u271d : deriv g x\u2081 < 0\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase h1.h\ng : \u211d \u2192 \u211d\nhg : Continuous g\nM : \u211d\nhM : \u2200 (x : \u211d), |deriv g x| \u2264 M\n\u03b5 : \u211d\nh\u03b5 : \u03b5 > 0\nh\u03b5' : \u03b5 < 1 / (M + 1)\nx\u2081 x\u2082 : \u211d\nh : (fun x => x + \u03b5 * g x) x\u2081 = (fun x => x + \u03b5 * g x) x\u2082\nh' : \u03b5 * g x\u2081 = \u03b5 * g x\u2082\nh'' : g x\u2081 = g x\u2082\nh'''' : deriv g x\u2081 = deriv g x\u2082\nh''''' : |deriv g x\u2081| \u2264 M\nh'''''' : |deriv g x\u2082| \u2264 M\nh''''''' : |deriv g x\u2081| = |deriv g x\u2082|\nh'''''''' : deriv g x\u2081 = deriv g x\u2082\nh''''''''' : deriv g x\u2081 = 0\nh'''''''''' : deriv g x\u2082 = 0\na\u271d : deriv g (x\u2081 -

We can see that $g(-1) = f(-1) - (-1)^3 = 0 - (-1) = 1$ and $g(1) = f(1) - 1^3 = 1 - 1 = 0$. \n\nThis tells us that the function $g$ takes on the values $0$ and $1$ at the endpoints of the interval $[-1,1]$. \n\nSince $g$ is also three times differentiable on $[-1,1]$, we can apply Rolle's theorem to $g$ on the interval $[-1,1]$. \n\nRolle's theorem states that if a function $g$ is continuous on the closed interval $[a,b]$ and differentiable on the open interval $(a,b)$, and if $g(a) = g(b)$, then there exists a point $c$ in $(a,b)$ such that $g'(c) = 0$. \n\nApplying Rolle's theorem to $g$ on the interval $[-1,1]$, we get that there exists a point $c$ in $(-1,1)$ such that $g'(c) = 0$. \n\nNow, let's consider the function $h(x) = g'(x)$. We can see that $h(x) = f'(x) - 3x^2$. \n\nSince $g'(c) = 0$, we have $h(c) = 0$. \n\nAlso, since $f'(0) = 0$, we have $h(0) = f'(0) - 3(0)^2 = 0 - 0 = 0$. \n\nThis tells us that the function $h$ takes on the value $0$ at two distinct points $c$ and $0$ in the interval $(-1,1)$. \n\nApplying Rolle's theorem to $h$ on the interval $[0,c]$, we get that there exists a point $d$ in $(0,c)$ such that $h'(d) = 0$. \n\nNow, let's consider the function $k(x) = h'(x)$. We can see that $k(x) = f''(x) - 6x$. \n\nSince $h'(d) = 0$, we have $k(d) = 0$. \n\nAlso, since $f''(0) = f'(0)' = (f'(0))' = 0$, we have $k(0) = f''(0) - 6(0) = 0 - 0 = 0$. \n\nThis tells us that the function $k$ takes on the value $0$ at two distinct points $d$ and $0$ in the interval $(-1,1)$. \n\nApplying Rolle's theorem to $k$ on the interval $[0,d]$, we get that there exists a point $e$ in $(0,d)$ such that $k'(e) = 0$. \n\nNow, let's consider the function $l(x) = k'(x)$. We can see that $l(x) = f'''(x) - 6$. \n\nSince $k'(e) = 0$, we have $l(e) = 0$. \n\nThis tells us that the function $l$ takes on the value $0$ at some point $e$ in the interval $(-1,1)$. \n\nHowever, we also know that $l(x) = f'''(x) - 6$. \n\nThis implies that $f'''(e) = l(e) + 6 = 0 + 6 = 6$. \n\nBut we can also see that $f'''(e) \\geq 0$ since $f'''(x)$ is a real-valued function. \n\nTherefore, we have $0 \\leq f'''(e) \\leq 6$. \n\nHowever, this is a contradiction since we know that $f'''(e) = 6$. \n\nThis means that our assumption that $f'''(e) \\leq 6$ must be false. \n\nTherefore, we have $f'''(e) > 6$. \n\nHowever, we can also see that $f'''(e) \\geq 0$ since $f'''(x)$ is a real-valued function. \n\nThis implies that $f'''(e) \\geq 6$. \n\nTherefore, we have shown that there exists a point $e$ in $(-1,1)$ such that $f'''(e) \\geq 3$. \n\nThis completes the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'let'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'let'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'let'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

Since the order of $G$ is even, we can divide the elements of $G$ into pairs, and there will be no element left over. This means that the set of all pairs is closed under the group operation, because for any two pairs $(a, a^{-1})$ and $(b, b^{-1})$, the product of the pairs is $(ab, b^{-1}a^{-1})$, which is also a pair.\n\nHowever, this set of pairs is not a group itself, because it does not contain the identity element $e$. This is because the identity element $e$ is paired with itself, but in a group, the inverse of an element is not the element itself. Therefore, the set of pairs is not closed under the group operation.\n\nBut this is a contradiction, because we assumed that the set of pairs is closed under the group operation.

Since the group has order 9, this element would have order 1, 3, or 9. If the element has order 1, then it would be the identity element, and it would commute with all other elements. If the element has order 9, then it would generate the entire group, and the group would be cyclic, as we discussed earlier.\n\nSo, we're left with the case where the element has order 3. In this case, this element would commute with the 2 elements of order 3 in the subgroup. Since the group has order 9, there would be only one element outside of the subgroup that has order 3, and this element would commute with the 2 elements of order 3 in the subgroup.\n\nTherefore, we've shown that any element in the group would commute with any other element in the group. This means that the group is abelian.\n\nIn summary, we've considered all possible cases and shown that the group must be abelian.",

We have a finite group $G$ and an automorphism $\\varphi$ of $G$ such that $\\varphi(x) = x^{-1}$ for more than three-fourths of the elements of $G$. This means that for a large majority of elements in $G$, applying the automorphism $\\varphi$ results in the inverse of that element.\n\nNow, let's consider an arbitrary element $y \\in G$. We want to show that $\\varphi(y) = y^{-1}$ for all $y \\in G$. To do this, we can use the fact that $\\varphi$ is an automorphism, which means it is a bijective homomorphism from $G$ to itself.\n\nLet's assume that there exists an element $y \\in G$ such that $\\varphi(y) \\neq y^{-1}$. This means that $\\varphi(y)$ is not the inverse of $y$. Since $\\varphi$ is a homomorphism, we know that $\\varphi(y^2) = \\varphi(y)\\varphi(y) = \\varphi(y)^2$. But we also know that $\\varphi(y^2) = (y^2)^{-1} = (y^{-1})^2 = y^{-2}$.\n\nNow, let's consider the element $y^{-1}$. If $\\varphi(y) \\neq y^{-1}$, then we would expect that $\\varphi(y^{-1}) \\neq (y^{-1})^{-1} = y$. However, since $\\varphi$ is a homomorphism, we know that $\\varphi(y^{-1}) = \\varphi(y)^{-1}$. But we also know that $\\varphi(y)^{-1} = (y^{-1})^{-1} = y$, which is a contradiction.\n\nThis means that our initial assumption that there exists an element $y \\in G$ such that $\\varphi(y) \\neq y^{-1}$ must be false. Therefore, we conclude that $\\varphi(y) = y^{-1}$ for all $y \\in G$.\n\nNow that we have shown that $\\varphi(y) = y^{-1}$ for all $y \\in G$, we can use this information to show that $G$ is abelian. Let's consider two arbitrary elements $x, y \\in G$. We know that $\\varphi(x) = x^{-1}$ and $\\varphi(y) = y^{-1}$. Since $\\varphi$ is a homomorphism, we know that $\\varphi(xy) = \\varphi(x)\\varphi(y) = x^{-1}y^{-1}$. But we also know that $\\varphi(xy) = (xy)^{-1} = y^{-1}x^{-1}$.\n\nSince $\\varphi(xy) = x^{-1}y^{-1} = y^{-1}x^{-1}$, we can conclude that $x^{-1}y^{-1} = y^{-1}x^{-1}$. Multiplying both sides by $xy$ on the left, we get $xy = yx$, which shows that $G$ is abelian.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that if a finite group $G$ has an automorphism $\\varphi$ such that $\\varphi(x) = x^{-1}$ for more than three-fourths of the elements of $G$, then $G$ is abelian.\nPrevious attempt failed with: type mismatch\n  Finset.mem_univ x\nhas type\n  x \u2208 Finset.univ : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  x \u2208 I : Prop\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  \u03c6 (x * y)\nG : Type u_1\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : Group G\ninst\u271d : Fintype G\n\u03c6 : G \u2243* G\nI : Finset G\nhI : \u2200 x \u2208 I, \u03c6 x = x\u207b\u00b9\nhI1 : 0.75 * \u2191(card G) \u2264 \u2191(card { x // x \u2208 I })\nh1 : \u2200 (x : G), \u03c6 x = x\u207b\u00b9\nx y : G\nh3 : \u03c6 (x * y) = \u03c6 x * \u03c6 y\nh4 : \u03c6 (x * y) = (x * y)\u207b\u00b9\nh5 : \u03c6 x * \u03c6 y = x\u207b\u00b9 * y\u207b\u00b9\nh6 : (x * y)\u207b\u00b9 = y\u207b\u00b9 * x\u207b\u00b9\n\u22a2 x * y = y * x\ninvalid constructor \u27e8...\u27e9, expected type must be an inductive type \n  \u2200 (x : G), \u03c6 x = x\u207b\u00b9 \u2227 \u2200 (x y : G), x * y = y * x\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  \u03c6 (\u03c6.symm ?y)\ncase a\nG : Type u_1\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : Group G\ninst\u271d : Fintype G\n\u03c6 : G \u2243* G\nI : Finset G\nhI : \u2200 x \u2208 I, \u03c6 x = x\u207b\u00b9\nhI1 : 0.75 * \u2191(card G) \u2264 \u2191(card { x // x \u2208 I })\nx : G\nhx : \u00ac\u03c6 x = x\u207b\u00b9\nh2 : \u03c6 x \u2260 x\u207b\u00b9\n\u22a2 \u03c6 (\u03c6 x) = \u03c6 x\u207b\u00b9\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  \u03c6 (x * y)\nG : Type u_1\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : Group G\ninst\u271d : Fintype G\n\u03c6 : G \u2243* G\nI : Finset G\nhI : \u2200 x \u2208 I, \u03c6 x = x\u207b\u00b9\nhI1 : 0.75 * \u2191(card G) \u2264 \u2191(card { x // x \u2208 I })\nh1 : \u2200 (x : G), \u03c6 x = x\u207b\u00b9\nx y : G\nh3 : \u03c6 (x * y) = \u03c6 x * \u03c6 y\nh4 : \u03c6 (x * y) = (x * y)\u207b\u00b9\nh5 : \u03c6 x * \u03c6 y = x\u207b\u00b9 * y\u207b\u00b9\nh6 : (x * y)\u207b\u00b9 = y\u207b\u00b9 * x\u207b\u00b9\n\u22a2 x * y = y * x\ninvalid constructor \u27e8...\u27e9, expected type must be an inductive type \n  \u2200 (x : G), \u03c6 x = x\u207b\u00b9 \u2227 \u2200 (x y : G), x * y = y * x\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  hI x (Finset.mem_univ x)\nargument\n  Finset.mem_univ x\nhas type\n  x \u2208 Finset.univ : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  x \u2208 I : Prop\nno goals to be solved\napplication type mismatch\n  hI (\u03c6 x) (Finset.mem_univ (\u03c6 x))\nargument\n  Finset.mem_univ (\u03c6 x)\nhas type\n  \u03c6 x \u2208 Finset.univ : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u03c6 x \u2208 I : Prop\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  (\u03c6 x)\u207b\u00b9\nG : Type u_1\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : Group G\ninst\u271d : Fintype G\n\u03c6 : G \u2243* G\nI : Finset G\nhI : \u2200 x \u2208 I, \u03c6 x = x\u207b\u00b9\nhI1 : 0.75 * \u2191(card G) \u2264 \u2191(card { x // x \u2208 I })\nx : G\nhx : \u00ac\u03c6 x = x\u207b\u00b9\nh2 : \u03c6 x \u2260 x\u207b\u00b9\nh3 : \u03c6 (\u03c6 x) = \u03c6 x\u207b\u00b9\n\u22a2 \u03c6 x\u207b\u00b9 = x\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  \u03c6 (\u03c6.symm ?y)\nG : Type u_1\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : Group G\ninst\u271d : Fintype G\n\u03c6 : G \u2243* G\nI : Finset G\nhI : \u2200 x \u2208 I, \u03c6 x = x\u207b\u00b9\nhI1 : 0.75 * \u2191(card G) \u2264 \u2191(card { x // x \u2208 I })\nx : G\nhx : \u00ac\u03c6 x = x\u207b\u00b9\nh2 : \u03c6 x \u2260 x\u207b\u00b9\nh3 : \u03c6 (\u03c6 x) = \u03c6 x\u207b\u00b9\nh4 : \u03c6 (\u03c6 x) = x\n\u22a2 \u03c6 x\u207b\u00b9 = (\u03c6 x\u207b\u00b9)\u207b\u00b9\napplication type mismatch\n  h2 h5\nargument\n  h5\nhas type\n  x = x\u207b\u00b9 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u03c6 x = x\u207b\u00b9 : Prop\ntactic 'constructor' failed, target is not an inductive datatype\nG : Type u_1\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : Group G\ninst\u271d : Fintype G\n\u03c6 : G \u2243* G\nI : Finset G\nhI : \u2200 x \u2208 I, \u03c6 x = x\u207b\u00b9\nhI1 : 0.75 * \u2191(card G) \u2264 \u2191(card { x // x \u2208 I })\nh1 : \u2200 (x : G), \u03c6 x = x\u207b\u00b9\n\u22a2 \u2200 (x : G), \u03c6 x = x\u207b\u00b9 \u2227 \u2200 (x y : G), x * y = y * x\nPlease revise the proof.",

We are given two primes $p$ and $q$ such that $q$ divides $p-1$. This information will be crucial in our proof.\n\nLet's consider a nonabelian group $G$ of order $pq$. Since $G$ is nonabelian, it cannot be cyclic. Therefore, $G$ must have a nontrivial center, which we'll denote as $Z(G)$. The order of $Z(G)$ must divide the order of $G$, which is $pq$. Since $p$ and $q$ are primes, the only possible orders for $Z(G)$ are $1$, $p$, or $q$.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where $|Z(G)| = p$. In this case, $G/Z(G)$ would be a group of order $q$, which is cyclic. This would imply that $G$ is abelian, which contradicts our assumption that $G$ is nonabelian. Therefore, $|Z(G)| \\neq p$.\n\nSimilarly, if $|Z(G)| = q$, then $G/Z(G)$ would be a group of order $p$, which is also cyclic. Again, this would imply that $G$ is abelian, which is a contradiction. Therefore, $|Z(G)| \\neq q$.\n\nThe only remaining possibility is that $|Z(G)| = 1$. In this case, $G$ is a nonabelian group of order $pq$ with a trivial center.\n\nNow, let's consider another nonabelian group $H$ of order $pq$. Since $H$ is nonabelian, it also has a trivial center. We need to show that $G$ and $H$ are isomorphic.\n\nTo do this, we can use the fact that any group of order $pq$ has a subgroup of order $p$ and a subgroup of order $q$. Let's denote the subgroups of order $p$ in $G$ and $H$ as $P_G$ and $P_H$, respectively. Similarly, let's denote the subgroups of order $q$ in $G$ and $H$ as $Q_G$ and $Q_H$, respectively.\n\nSince $G$ and $H$ are nonabelian, $P_G$ and $P_H$ are normal subgroups of $G$ and $H$, respectively. Therefore, $P_G \\cap Q_G = \\{e\\}$ and $P_H \\cap Q_H = \\{e\\}$, where $e$ is the identity element.\n\nNow, let's consider the map $\\phi: G \\to H$ that sends $P_G$ to $P_H$ and $Q_G$ to $Q_H$. This map is well-defined because $P_G \\cap Q_G = \\{e\\}$ and $P_H \\cap Q_H = \\{e\\}$. Moreover, $\\phi$ is a homomorphism because it preserves the group operation.\n\nSince $G$ and $H$ have the same order, $\\phi$ is either injective or surjective. However, $\\phi$ cannot be injective because $G$ and $H$ are nonabelian, and $\\phi$ would map the nontrivial center of $G$ to the nontrivial center of $H$, which is not possible.\n\nTherefore, $\\phi$ must be surjective. Since $\\phi$ is a surjective homomorphism between two groups of the same order, it is an isomorphism.\n\nThis completes our proof that any two nonabelian groups of order $pq$ are isomorphic.\nPrevious attempt failed with: \nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: \nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: \nPlease revise the proof.",

This means that for any $a \\in A$ and any $g \\in G$, we have $gag^{-1} \\in A$.\n\nNow, let's consider the element $b \\in G$ of prime order $p$. This means that $b^p = e$, and $b^k \\neq e$ for any positive integer $k < p$.\n\nSince $b \\not\\in A$, we know that $b$ is not an element of the normal subgroup $A$. However, we can still consider the subgroup generated by $b$, denoted as $(b)$. This subgroup consists of all elements of the form $b^k$, where $k$ is an integer.\n\nNow, let's consider an arbitrary element $x \\in A \\cap (b)$. By definition of intersection, we know that $x \\in A$ and $x \\in (b)$. Since $x \\in A$, we know that $x$ is an element of the normal subgroup $A$. And since $x \\in (b)$, we know that $x$ is an element of the subgroup generated by $b$.\n\nSince $x \\in (b)$, we can write $x = b^k$ for some integer $k$. Now, since $x \\in A$ and $A$ is a normal subgroup, we know that $x = b^k$ is conjugate to some element of $A$. In other words, there exists some $a \\in A$ such that $x = aba^{-1}$.\n\nNow, let's consider the element $b^k$. Since $b$ has prime order $p$, we know that $b^p = e$. Therefore, we can write $b^k = (b^p)^{k/p} = e^{k/p} = e$, since $p$ is prime and $k/p$ is an integer.\n\nHowever, we also know that $x = aba^{-1} \\in A$, and $A$ is a subgroup. Therefore, we can take the inverse of both sides to get $x^{-1} = a^{-1}ba \\in A$. But since $x = b^k$, we have $x^{-1} = (b^k)^{-1} = b^{-k}$. Therefore, we have $b^{-k} = a^{-1}ba$.\n\nNow, let's consider the element $b^{-1}$. Since $b$ has prime order $p$, we know that $b^p = e$. Therefore, we can write $b^{-1} = b^{p-1}$. Substituting this into the previous equation, we get $b^{p-1-k} = a^{-1}ba$.\n\nSince $b$ has prime order $p$, we know that $b^p = e$. Therefore, we can write $b^{p-1-k} = b^{p-1}b^{-k} = e \\cdot b^{-k} = b^{-k}$. Therefore, we have $b^{-k} = a^{-1}ba$.\n\nNow, let's consider the element $a^{-1}ba$. Since $a \\in A$ and $A$ is a normal subgroup, we know that $a^{-1}ba \\in A$. But since $b \\not\\in A$, we know that $a^{-1}ba \\neq b$. Therefore, we must have $a^{-1}ba = e$.\n\nNow, let's consider the element $b^{-k}$. Since $b^{-k} = a^{-1}ba = e$, we know that $b^{-k} = e$. Therefore, we can write $b^{-k} = e^k = e$, since $e$ is the identity element.\n\nNow, let's consider the element $x = b^k$. Since $b^{-k} = e$, we know that $b^k = e$. Therefore, we have $x = e$.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that any element $x \\in A \\cap (b)$ must be equal to the identity element $e$.

This means that $P$ is the largest subgroup of $G$ whose order is a power of $p$. Also, note that $P$ is normal in $G$, denoted as $P \\triangleleft G$, which implies that $gPg^{-1} = P$ for all $g \\in G$.\n\nNow, let's consider an automorphism $\\varphi$ of $G$. An automorphism is an isomorphism from $G$ to itself, meaning it's a bijective homomorphism. This implies that $\\varphi$ preserves the group operation, i.e., $\\varphi(ab) = \\varphi(a)\\varphi(b)$ for all $a, b \\in G$.\n\nWe want to show that $\\varphi(P) = P$. To do this, we'll use the fact that $P$ is normal in $G$. Let $p$ be the prime number such that $P$ is a $p$-Sylow subgroup of $G$. Since $P$ is normal in $G$, we have $gPg^{-1} = P$ for all $g \\in G$.\n\nNow, consider an element $x \\in P$. Since $P$ is a subgroup of $G$, we have $x \\in G$. Applying the automorphism $\\varphi$ to $x$, we get $\\varphi(x) \\in G$. Since $P$ is normal in $G$, we have $gxg^{-1} \\in P$ for all $g \\in G$. In particular, taking $g = x$, we get $xPx^{-1} \\subseteq P$.\n\nApplying the automorphism $\\varphi$ to both sides of the inclusion, we get $\\varphi(x)\\varphi(P)\\varphi(x)^{-1} \\subseteq \\varphi(P)$. Since $\\varphi$ is an automorphism, we have $\\varphi(x)\\varphi(P)\\varphi(x)^{-1} = \\varphi(xPx^{-1})$. But $xPx^{-1} \\subseteq P$, so $\\varphi(xPx^{-1}) \\subseteq \\varphi(P)$.\n\nNow, since $P$ is a subgroup of $G$, we have $xPx^{-1} = P$. Therefore, $\\varphi(xPx^{-1}) = \\varphi(P)$. Combining this with the previous inclusion, we get $\\varphi(P) \\subseteq \\varphi(P)$.\n\nTo show that $\\varphi(P) = P$, we need to show that $P \\subseteq \\varphi(P)$. Let $y \\in P$. Since $P$ is a subgroup of $G$, we have $y \\in G$. Applying the automorphism $\\varphi$ to $y$, we get $\\varphi(y) \\in G$. Since $P$ is normal in $G$, we have $gyg^{-1} \\in P$ for all $g \\in G$. In particular, taking $g = \\varphi(y)$, we get $\\varphi(y)P\\varphi(y)^{-1} \\subseteq P$.\n\nApplying the automorphism $\\varphi^{-1}$ to both sides of the inclusion, we get $\\varphi^{-1}(\\varphi(y)P\\varphi(y)^{-1}) \\subseteq \\varphi^{-1}(P)$. Since $\\varphi^{-1}$ is an automorphism, we have $\\varphi^{-1}(\\varphi(y)P\\varphi(y)^{-1}) = yP\\varphi(y)^{-1}$. But $\\varphi(y)P\\varphi(y)^{-1} \\subseteq P$, so $yP\\varphi(y)^{-1} \\subseteq \\varphi^{-1}(P)$.\n\nNow, since $P$ is a subgroup of $G$, we have $yP\\varphi(y)^{-1} = P$.

This means that the elements that are moved by $\\sigma$ and $\\tau$ are disjoint, i.e., they have no intersection.\n\nNow, we are given that $\\sigma \\tau = e$, where $e$ is the identity permutation. This implies that when we apply $\\sigma$ followed by $\\tau$, we end up with the original arrangement of elements.\n\nLet's consider an arbitrary element $a$ that is disturbed by $\\sigma$. Since $\\sigma$ and $\\tau$ disturb no common element, $a$ is not disturbed by $\\tau$. Therefore, when we apply $\\tau$ to the arrangement obtained after applying $\\sigma$, the element $a$ remains in its original position.\n\nSince this is true for all elements disturbed by $\\sigma$, we can conclude that $\\sigma$ must be the identity permutation. This is because the only permutation that leaves all elements in their original position is the identity permutation.\n\nNow, let's consider an arbitrary element $b$ that is disturbed by $\\tau$. Since $\\sigma \\tau = e$, we know that applying $\\sigma$ followed by $\\tau$ leaves all elements in their original position.

Since the entries are in $\\mathbb{Z}_2$, each entry can be either 0 or 1. The determinant of a $2\\times 2$ matrix $A = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix}$ is given by $ad - bc$. In $\\mathbb{Z}_2$, this simplifies to $ad + bc$ (since $-1 = 1$ in $\\mathbb{Z}_2$). For the determinant to be non-zero, we must have $ad + bc \\neq 0$, which is equivalent to $ad + bc = 1$.\n\nNow, let's count the number of elements in $T$. We have 4 choices for each entry (0 or 1), but the last entry is determined by the first three entries. So, there are $2^3 = 8$ possible matrices, but only 6 of them have a non-zero determinant. These 6 matrices are:\n\n1. $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n2. $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n3. $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n4. $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n5. $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n6. $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ (this one is actually not valid, since the determinant is 0)\n\nHowever, we can see that the last one is not valid, so we actually have 5 valid matrices.\n\nNow, let's consider the symmetric group $S_3$. It has 6 elements: $e, (12), (13), (23), (123), (132)$. We can define a mapping from $T$ to $S_3$ by:\n\n* $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\mapsto e$\n* $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\mapsto (12)$\n* $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\mapsto (13)$\n* $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\mapsto (23)$\n* $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\mapsto (123)$\n* $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\mapsto (132)$\n\nThis mapping is a bijection, since each element in $T$ maps to a unique element in $S_3$, and vice versa.\n\nTo show that this mapping is a homomorphism, we need to show that it preserves the group operation. Let's consider two elements in $T$, say $\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\begin{pmatrix} e & f \\\\ g & h \\end{pmatrix}$. Their product is given by:\n\n$\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} e & f \\\\ g & h \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} ae + bg & af + bh \\\\ ce + dg & cf + dh \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe determinant of this product is $(ae + bg)(cf + dh) - (af + bh)(ce + dg)$. In $\\mathbb{Z}_2$, this simplifies to $(ae + bg)(cf + dh) + (af + bh)(ce + dg)$.\n\nNow, let's consider the mapping of these two elements to $S_3$. Say $\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix} \\mapsto x$ and $\\begin{pmatrix} e & f \\\\ g & h \\end{pmatrix} \\mapsto y$. Then, the product of these two elements in $T$ maps to the product of $x$ and $y$ in $S_3$.\n\nTo show that this mapping preserves the group operation, we need to show that the product of the two elements in $T$ maps to the same element in $S_3$ as the product of the two elements in $S_3$.\n\nLet's consider the product of the two elements in $S_3$, say $xy$. We can compute this product by multiplying the two permutations:\n\n$xy = (x_1 x_2 \\ldots x_n) (y_1 y_2 \\ldots y_n) = (x_1 y_1) (x_2 y_2) \\ldots (x_n y_n)$\n\nNow, let's consider the product of the two elements in $T$, say $\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} e & f \\\\ g & h \\end{pmatrix}$. We can compute this product by multiplying the two matrices:\n\n$\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} e & f \\\\ g & h \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} ae + bg & af + bh \\\\ ce + dg & cf + dh \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe determinant of this product is $(ae + bg)(cf + dh) - (af + bh)(ce + dg)$. In $\\mathbb{Z}_2$, this simplifies to $(ae + bg)(cf + dh) + (af + bh)(ce + dg)$.\n\nNow, let's compare the two products. We can see that the product of the two elements in $S_3$ is the same as the product of the two elements in $T$, since the determinant of the product of the two elements in $T$ is the same as the product of the two elements in $S_3$.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that the mapping from $T$ to $S_3$ is a bijective homomorphism, and therefore $T$ is isomorphic to $S_3$.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  Mul S3\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  Mul S3\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  Mul S3\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nPlease revise the proof.",

This means that $a$ can be expressed as the square of some integer $\\mod p$.\n\nNow, let's consider the numbers $1, 2, \\ldots, p - 1$. We can pair these numbers up in the following way: for each number $a$, we can pair it with its \"partner\" $p - a$. This pairing is one-to-one, meaning that each number is paired with exactly one other number.\n\nFor example, if $p = 7$, we can pair the numbers as follows: $(1, 6), (2, 5), (3, 4)$. Notice that each number is paired with its \"partner\" $p - a$.\n\nNow, let's consider the squares of these numbers. For each number $a$, we can calculate its square $\\mod p$. If $a$ is a quadratic residue, then its square will be a quadratic residue as well. But if $a$ is a quadratic nonresidue, then its square will be a quadratic residue.\n\nFor example, if $p = 7$, we can calculate the squares of the numbers as follows: $1^2 \\equiv 1 \\mod 7$, $2^2 \\equiv 4 \\mod 7$, $3^2 \\equiv 2 \\mod 7$, $4^2 \\equiv 2 \\mod 7$, $5^2 \\equiv 4 \\mod 7$, $6^2 \\equiv 1 \\mod 7$. Notice that the squares of the numbers are paired up in the same way as the original numbers.\n\nIn general, we can see that the squares of the numbers are paired up in the following way: if $a$ is a quadratic residue, then its square is a quadratic residue, and if $a$ is a quadratic nonresidue, then its square is a quadratic residue. This means that the squares of the numbers are evenly distributed between quadratic residues and quadratic nonresidues.\n\nSince there are $(p - 1)/2$ squares of the numbers, and these squares are evenly distributed between quadratic residues and quadratic nonresidues, we can conclude that there are also $(p - 1)/2$ quadratic residues and $(p - 1)/2$ quadratic nonresidues among the numbers $1, 2, \\ldots, p - 1$.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that $(p - 1)/2$ of the numbers $1, 2, \\ldots, p - 1$ are quadratic residues and $(p - 1)/2$ are quadratic nonresidues $\\mod p$.\nPrevious attempt failed with: \nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: \nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: \nPlease revise the proof.",

Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that $p(x)$ is reducible. Then, it must have a linear factor, which means there exists an element $a \\in F$ such that $p(a) = 0$. This implies that $a^3 - 2 = 0$, or $a^3 = 2$. However, since $F = \\mathbb{Z}_7$, the only possible values for $a$ are $0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,$ and $6$. We can easily check that none of these values satisfy $a^3 = 2$. Therefore, $p(x)$ has no linear factors, and it must be irreducible.\n\nA similar argument can be applied to $q(x) = x^3 + 2$. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that $q(x)$ is reducible. Then, it must have a linear factor, which means there exists an element $a \\in F$ such that $q(a) = 0$.

Therefore, $q(x)$ has no linear factors, and it must be irreducible.\n\nNow, let's consider the fields $F[x]/(p(x))$ and $F[x]/(q(x))$. Since $p(x)$ and $q(x)$ are irreducible, the quotient rings $F[x]/(p(x))$ and $F[x]/(q(x))$ are fields.

This map is well-defined because if $f(x) \\equiv g(x) \\pmod{p(x)}$, then $f(x^2) \\equiv g(x^2) \\pmod{q(x)}$.\n\nTo show that $\\phi$ is a homomorphism, we need to verify that it preserves addition and multiplication.

Then, we have:\n\n$\\phi([f(x)] + [g(x)]) = \\phi([f(x) + g(x)]) = [f(x) + g(x)]^2 = [f(x)^2 + 2f(x)g(x) + g(x)^2] = [f(x^2)] + [2f(x)g(x^2)] + [g(x^2)] = \\phi([f(x)]) + \\phi([g(x)])$\n\n$\\phi([f(x)] \\cdot [g(x)]) = \\phi([f(x)g(x)]) = [f(x)g(x)]^2 = [f(x^2)g(x^2)] = \\phi([f(x)]) \\cdot \\phi([g(x)])$\n\nTherefore, $\\phi$ is a homomorphism.\n\nTo show that $\\phi$ is an isomorphism, we need to verify that it is bijective. Let $[f(x)]$ be an element in $F[x]/(p(x))$. Then, we can write $f(x) = a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2$. Since $p(x)$ is irreducible, we know that $x^3 - 2$ has no linear factors, and therefore, $x^2$ is not a root of $p(x)$. This means that $f(x^2)$ is not a multiple of $q(x)$, and therefore, $[f(x^2)]$ is not the zero element in $F[x]/(q(x))$. Therefore, $\\phi$ is injective.\n\nTo show that $\\phi$ is surjective, let $[g(x)]$ be an element in $F[x]/(q(x))$. Then, we can write $g(x) = b_0 + b_1x + b_2x^2$. Since $q(x)$ is irreducible, we know that $x^3 + 2$ has no linear factors, and therefore, $x^2$ is not a root of $q(x)$. This means that $g(x^2)$ is not a multiple of $p(x)$, and therefore, $[g(x^2)]$ is not the zero element in $F[x]/(p(x))$. Therefore, $\\phi$ is surjective.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that $\\phi$ is a bijective homomorphism, and therefore, it is an isomorphism between the fields $F[x]/(p(x))$ and $F[x]/(q(x))$.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'irreducible_of_degree_eq_one_or_prime'\nunknown identifier 'irreducible_of_degree_eq_one_or_prime'\ninvalid constructor \u27e8...\u27e9, insufficient number of arguments, constructs 'RingEquiv.mk' has #3 explicit fields, but only #2 provided\nno goals to be solved\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: expected '{' or indented tactic sequence\nunsolved goals\np q : (ZMod 7)[X]\nhp : p = X ^ 3 - 2\nhq : q = X ^ 3 + 2\nhp_irred : Irreducible p\nhq_irred : Irreducible q\nh_iso : Nonempty ((ZMod 7)[X] \u29f8 span {p} \u2243+* (ZMod 7)[X] \u29f8 span {q})\n\u22a2 Irreducible p \u2227 Irreducible q \u2227 Nonempty ((ZMod 7)[X] \u29f8 span {p} \u2243+* (ZMod 7)[X] \u29f8 span {q})\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: \nPlease revise the proof.",

Then, it can be factored into two non-constant polynomials $g(x)$ and $h(x)$ with rational coefficients, such that $f(x) = g(x)h(x)$.\n\nSince the degree of $f(x)$ is 3, the degrees of $g(x)$ and $h(x)$ must add up to 3. This means that one of them must have degree 1 (linear) and the other must have degree 2 (quadratic).\n\nWithout loss of generality, let's assume that $g(x)$ is linear and $h(x)$ is quadratic. Then, we can write $g(x) = ax + b$ and $h(x) = cx^2 + dx + e$, where $a, b, c, d, e$ are rational numbers.\n\nNow, we can expand the product $g(x)h(x)$ and equate it to $f(x)$:\n\n$(ax + b)(cx^2 + dx + e) = x^3 + 3x + 2$\n\nExpanding the left-hand side, we get:\n\n$acx^3 + (ad + bc)x^2 + (ae + bd)x + be = x^3 + 3x + 2$\n\nComparing the coefficients of the $x^3$ term on both sides, we get:\n\n$ac = 1$\n\nThis implies that $a$ and $c$ are both non-zero rational numbers.\n\nNow, let's compare the constant terms on both sides:\n\n$be = 2$\n\nSince $b$ and $e$ are rational numbers, this implies that $b$ and $e$ are both non-zero rational numbers.\n\nBut now, we have a problem: the coefficient of the $x$ term on the left-hand side is $ae + bd$, and the coefficient of the $x$ term on the right-hand side is 3. Since $a, b, c, d, e$ are rational numbers, this implies that $ae + bd$ must be a rational number.\n\nHowever, we also know that $ae$ is a rational number (since $a$ and $e$ are rational numbers), and $bd$ is a rational number (since $b$ and $d$ are rational numbers). But the sum of two rational numbers is not necessarily a rational number, unless the two rational numbers are equal.\n\nSo, we must have $ae = bd$. But this implies that $a = b$ and $e = d$, since $a, b, c, d, e$ are non-zero rational numbers.\n\nNow, we can substitute $a = b$ and $e = d$ back into the equation $be = 2$. This gives us:\n\n$b^2 = 2$\n\nBut this is a contradiction, since $b$ is a rational number and $b^2 = 2$ has no rational solutions.\n\nTherefore, our assumption that $f(x)$ is reducible in $Q[x]$ must be false, and we conclude that $f(x)$ is irreducible in $Q[x]$.",

In this case, $m = p = p^1$. We need to show that $(a + b)^p = a^p + b^p$. Since $F$ is a field of characteristic $p$, we know that $p$ is the smallest positive integer such that $p \\cdot 1 = 0$ in $F$. This means that for any element $x \\in F$, we have $x^p = x$.\n\nUsing this property, we can expand $(a + b)^p$ as follows:\n\n$(a + b)^p = a^p + \\binom{p}{1} a^{p-1} b + \\binom{p}{2} a^{p-2} b^2 + \\ldots + \\binom{p}{p-1} a b^{p-1} + b^p$\n\nSince $p$ is the smallest positive integer such that $p \\cdot 1 = 0$ in $F$, we know that $\\binom{p}{k} = 0$ for all $1 \\leq k \\leq p-1$. Therefore, the above expression simplifies to:\n\n$(a + b)^p = a^p + b^p$\n\nThis completes the base case.\n\nNow, let's assume that the result holds for some positive integer $k$, i.e., $(a + b)^{p^k} = a^{p^k} + b^{p^k}$. We need to show that it also holds for $k+1$, i.e., $(a + b)^{p^{k+1}} = a^{p^{k+1}} + b^{p^{k+1}}$.\n\nUsing the induction hypothesis, we can write:\n\n$(a + b)^{p^{k+1}} = ((a + b)^{p^k})^{p}$\n\nSince we assumed that the result holds for $k$, we know that:\n\n$((a + b)^{p^k})^{p} = (a^{p^k} + b^{p^k})^p$\n\nUsing the same property that we used in the base case, we can expand $(a^{p^k} + b^{p^k})^p$ as follows:\n\n$(a^{p^k} + b^{p^k})^p = a^{p^{k+1}} + \\binom{p}{1} a^{p^k} b^{p^k} + \\binom{p}{2} a^{p^k} b^{2p^k} + \\ldots + \\binom{p}{p-1} a^{p^k} b^{(p-1)p^k} + b^{p^{k+1}}$\n\nAgain, since $p$ is the smallest positive integer such that $p \\cdot 1 = 0$ in $F$, we know that $\\binom{p}{k} = 0$ for all $1 \\leq k \\leq p-1$. Therefore, the above expression simplifies to:\n\n$(a^{p^k} + b^{p^k})^p = a^{p^{k+1}} + b^{p^{k+1}}$\n\nThis completes the induction step.\n\nTherefore, by mathematical induction, we have shown that $(a + b)^m = a^m + b^m$ for all $a, b \\in F$ and any positive integer $n$, where $m = p^n$ for some positive integer $n$.\nPrevious attempt failed with: invalid field 'eq_zero_or_eq_zero_of_mul_eq_zero', the environment does not contain 'Irreducible.eq_zero_or_eq_zero_of_mul_eq_zero'\n  hp\nhas type\n  Irreducible p\nsimp made no progress\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  ?a + (?b + ?c)\ncase succ\np m : \u2115\nF : Type u_1\ninst\u271d : Field F\nhp : p.Prime\nhF : CharP F p\na b : F\nn : \u2115\nih : m = p ^ n \u2192 (a + b) ^ m = a ^ m + b ^ m\nhm : m = p ^ (n + 1)\n\u22a2 ((a + b) ^ p ^ n) ^ p = (a ^ p ^ n) ^ p + (b ^ p ^ n) ^ p\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  ?a ^ (?n + 1)\ncase succ\np m : \u2115\nF : Type u_1\ninst\u271d : Field F\nhp : p.Prime\nhF : CharP F p\na b : F\nn : \u2115\nih : m = p ^ n \u2192 (a + b) ^ m = a ^ m + b ^ m\nhm : m = p ^ (n + 1)\n\u22a2 (a + b) ^ (p ^ n * p) = a ^ (p ^ n * p) + b ^ (p ^ n * p)\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "# Informal Proof:\n\nTo show that all the roots of $x^m - x$ are distinct, we first need to understand the properties of a field of characteristic $p \\neq 0$. In such a field, we have the property that $a + a + \\ldots + a = 0$ if $a$ is added to itself $p$ times. This is because in a field of characteristic $p$, the additive group is cyclic of order $p$, and thus any multiple of $p$ is equivalent to $0$.\n\nNow, let's consider the polynomial $x^m - x$, where $m = p^n$. We want to show that all the roots of this polynomial are distinct. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that there are two distinct roots, say $a$ and $b$, such that $a^m - a = b^m - b = 0$.\n\nSince $a$ and $b$ are roots of the polynomial, we have $a^m = a$ and $b^m = b$. We can rewrite these equations as $a^m - a = 0$ and $b^m - b = 0$. Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get $(a^m - b^m) - (a - b) = 0$.\n\nNow, using the fact that $a^m = a$ and $b^m = b$, we can rewrite the equation as $(a - b)^m - (a - b) = 0$. Since $m = p^n$, we can factor out $(a - b)$ from the left-hand side of the equation to get $(a - b)((a - b)^{p^n - 1} - 1) = 0$.\n\nSince $a \\neq b$, we know that $a - b \\neq 0$. Therefore, we must have $(a - b)^{p^n - 1} - 1 = 0$. This implies that $(a - b)^{p^n - 1} = 1$.\n\nNow, since $p$ is a prime number, we know that $p^n - 1$ is a multiple of $p$. Therefore, we can write $p^n - 1 = kp$ for some integer $k$. Substituting this into the equation, we get $(a - b)^{kp} = 1$.\n\nSince $p$ is a prime number, we know that the only solutions to the equation $x^p = 1$ are $x = 1$ and $x = \\zeta$, where $\\zeta$ is a primitive $p$th root of unity. Therefore, we must have $(a - b)^k = 1$ or $(a - b)^k = \\zeta$.\n\nHowever, since $a$ and $b$ are elements of a field of characteristic $p$, we know that $a - b$ is an element of the field. Therefore, we must have $(a - b)^k = 1$, since $\\zeta$ is not an element of the field.\n\nThis implies that $a - b = 1$, which is a contradiction since we assumed that $a \\neq b$. Therefore, our assumption that there are two distinct roots $a$ and $b$ must be false, and we conclude that all the roots of $x^m - x$ are distinct.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

This means that for every point $x \\in U$, there exists a neighborhood (or an open ball) around $x$ that is completely contained in $U$. Now, let's consider a point $x \\in U$ and assume, for the sake of contradiction, that $x$ is a limit point of the complement of $U$, denoted as $U^c$. This implies that there exists a sequence of points $\\{x_n\\}$ in $U^c$ that converges to $x$. However, since $U$ is open, there exists a neighborhood around $x$ that is completely contained in $U$. This neighborhood cannot contain any points of the sequence $\\{x_n\\}$, since they all belong to $U^c$. This is a contradiction, as we assumed that the sequence $\\{x_n\\}$ converges to $x$. Therefore, our assumption that $x$ is a limit point of $U^c$ must be false, and we conclude that none of the points in $U$ are limits of its complement.\n\n## Part 2: If none of the points in $U$ are limits of its complement, then $U$ is open.\n\nNow, let's assume that none of the points in $U$ are limits of its complement. We want to show that $U$ is open. Let $x \\in U$ be an arbitrary point. Since $x$ is not a limit point of $U^c$, there exists a neighborhood around $x$ that contains no points of $U^c$. This neighborhood must be completely contained in $U$, since any point in this neighborhood is either in $U$ or is a limit point of $U$, and we assumed that $x$ is not a limit point of $U^c$. Therefore, we have found a neighborhood around $x$ that is completely contained in $U$, which means that $U$ is open.\n\nBy proving both parts, we have shown that a set $U \\subset M$ is open if and only if none of its points are limits of its complement.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  \ud835\udcdd[?m.570] \u2191?x\ncase mp\nM : Type u_1\ninst\u271d : TopologicalSpace M\nU : Set M\nhU : IsOpen U\nx : M\nhx : x \u2208 U\n\u22a2 \u00ac(\ud835\udcdd x \u2293 \ud835\udcdf U\u1d9c).NeBot\ntype mismatch\n  hx\nhas type\n  x \u2208 U : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  U \u2286 U : Prop\nThe rfl tactic failed.

This set can be represented as the Cartesian product A \u00d7 B. Since A and B are compact, the Cartesian product A \u00d7 B is also compact.\n\nNow, define a function f: A \u00d7 B \u2192 \u211d by f((a, b)) = d(a, b). This function measures the distance between a point a in A and a point b in B.\n\nSince f is a continuous function (because the distance function is continuous), and the Cartesian product A \u00d7 B is compact, the function f attains its minimum value at some point (a0, b0) in A \u00d7 B.\n\nBy definition of the function f, we have f((a0, b0)) = d(a0, b0). Now, consider any other point (a, b) in A \u00d7 B. We want to show that d(a0, b0) \u2264 d(a, b).\n\nSince (a, b) is in A \u00d7 B, we can write f((a, b)) = d(a, b). But f is a continuous function, so it must also be bounded below on the compact set A \u00d7 B. This means that there exists a lower bound for f, say m.\n\nNow, since f attains its minimum value at (a0, b0), we have f((a0, b0)) = m. But f((a, b)) \u2265 m for all (a, b) in A \u00d7 B, including (a0, b0). Therefore, we have d(a0, b0) = m \u2264 d(a, b) for all (a, b) in A \u00d7 B.\n\nIn particular, if we take a in A and b in B, we have d(a0, b0) \u2264 d(a, b).

This is what we mean by a \"nested decreasing intersection\".\n\nSince each $K_n$ is compact, it is closed and bounded.

When $p > 1$, the integral converges to a finite value, specifically $\\int_0^\\infty 1/u^p du = \\frac{1}{p-1}u^{1-p} \\Big|_0^\\infty = \\frac{1}{p-1}$.\n\nSince the improper integral $\\int_1^\\infty 1/x(\\log(x))^p dx$ converges when $p > 1$, and since the function $f(x) = 1/x(\\log(x))^p$ is positive and continuous on the interval $[1, \\infty)$, we can conclude that the series $\\sum 1/k(\\log(k))^p$ converges when $p > 1$.\n\nThis is because the integral test tells us that if the improper integral converges, then the series also converges. Therefore, we have shown that the series $\\sum 1/k(\\log(k))^p$ converges when $p > 1$.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

This means that for any two elements a and b in F, \u03c6(a + b) = \u03c6(a) + \u03c6(b) and \u03c6(a * b) = \u03c6(a) * \u03c6(b).\n\nNow, let's assume that \u03c6 is not injective. This means there exist two distinct elements a and b in F such that \u03c6(a) = \u03c6(b). \n\nWe can use this assumption to derive a contradiction. Since \u03c6 is a homomorphism, we know that \u03c6(1) = 1, where 1 is the multiplicative identity in both F and G.\n\nUsing the property of homomorphism, we can write \u03c6(a - b) = \u03c6(a) - \u03c6(b) = \u03c6(b) - \u03c6(b) = 0. \n\nNow, since \u03c6 is a homomorphism, we can also write \u03c6(a - b) = \u03c6(a) * \u03c6(1 - b/a) = \u03c6(a) * \u03c6(1 - b/a) = \u03c6(a) * \u03c6(1) * \u03c6(1 - b/a) = \u03c6(a) * \u03c6(1 - b/a).\n\nSince \u03c6(a) = \u03c6(b), we can substitute \u03c6(b) for \u03c6(a) in the above equation, giving us \u03c6(b) * \u03c6(1 - b/a) = 0.\n\nNow, since \u03c6 is a homomorphism, we know that \u03c6(1 - b/a) is either 0 or 1. If \u03c6(1 - b/a) = 0, then we have \u03c6(b) = 0. But this is a problem, because we assumed that a and b are distinct elements, and \u03c6(a) = \u03c6(b) implies that a and b are not distinct.\n\nOn the other hand, if \u03c6(1 - b/a) = 1, then we have \u03c6(b) * 1 = 0, which implies that \u03c6(b) = 0. Again, this is a problem, because we assumed that a and b are distinct elements, and \u03c6(a) = \u03c6(b) implies that a and b are not distinct.\n\nIn either case, we have a contradiction, which means that our initial assumption that \u03c6 is not injective must be false. Therefore, every homomorphism of fields is injective.\nPrevious attempt failed with: simp made no progress\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: simp made no progress\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: simp made no progress\nPlease revise the proof.",

This is because if every vector in $V$ were contained in some $W_i$, then $W_i$ would be equal to $V$, contradicting the fact that $W_i$ is a proper subspace.\n\nNow, consider the set of all vectors $v_i$ that are not contained in any of the subspaces $W_i$. This set is non-empty, since we've just shown that each $W_i$ contains a vector not in $W_i$. Let's call this set $S = \\{v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_n\\}$.\n\nSince $F$ is an infinite field, we can choose a vector $v \\in S$ and a scalar $c \\in F$ such that $c \\neq 0$. We can then form the vector $cv \\in S$, since $cv$ is not contained in any of the subspaces $W_i$.\n\nNow, consider the subspace $W$ generated by the set of all vectors $cv$ for $c \\in F$ and $v \\in S$. This subspace $W$ is a proper subspace of $V$, since it's generated by a set of vectors that are not contained in any of the subspaces $W_i$.\n\nHowever, this creates a problem. Since $W$ is a proper subspace of $V$, there exists a vector $w \\in V$ such that $w \\notin W$. But $w$ must also be contained in one of the subspaces $W_i$, since $V = W_1 \\cup W_2 \\cup \\ldots \\cup W_n$. This is a contradiction, since $w$ cannot be contained in both $W$ and some $W_i$.\n\nTherefore, our initial assumption that $V$ is the union of finitely many proper subspaces must be false, and we conclude that $V$ is not the union of finitely many proper subspaces.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  OfNat \u03b9 0\nnumerals are polymorphic in Lean, but the numeral `0` cannot be used in a context where the expected type is\n  \u03b9\ndue to the absence of the instance above\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\napplication type mismatch\n  Set.ssubset_univ_iff.mpr h_inter\nargument\n  h_inter\nhas type\n  \u22c2 i, \u2191(\u03b3 i) = \u22a4 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  ?m.3447 \u2260 Set.univ : Prop\napplication type mismatch\n  hv (Set.mem_iInter.mp h_v_in_inter)\nargument\n  Set.mem_iInter.mp h_v_in_inter\nhas type\n  \u2200 (i : \u03b9), v \u2208 \u2191(\u03b3 i) : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u03b9 : Type u_3\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown constant 'Fintype.inhabited'\nunknown constant 'Set.exists_mem_of_ne_empty'\napplication type mismatch\n  Classical.choose h_v_in_top\nargument\n  h_v_in_top\nhas type\n  v \u2208 \u22c2 i, \u2191(\u03b3 i) : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u2203 x, ?m.3114 x : Prop\napplication type mismatch\n  Classical.choose_spec h_v_in_top\nargument\n  h_v_in_top\nhas type\n  v \u2208 \u22c2 i, \u2191(\u03b3 i) : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u2203 x, ?m.3446 x : Prop\nunsolved goals\ncase intro\nK : Type u_1\nV : Type u_2\ninst\u271d\u00b3 : Field K\ninst\u271d\u00b2 : AddCommGroup V\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : Module K V\n\u03b9 : Type u_3\ninst\u271d : Fintype \u03b9\n\u03b3 : \u03b9 \u2192 Submodule K V\nh : \u2200 (i : \u03b9), \u03b3 i \u2260 \u22a4\nh_inter : \u22c2 i, \u2191(\u03b3 i) = \u22a4\nv : V\nhv : \u2200 (i : \u03b9), v \u2208 \u03b3 i\nh_v_in_top : v \u2208 \u22c2 i, \u2191(\u03b3 i)\n\u22a2 False\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  OfNat \u03b9 0\nnumerals are polymorphic in Lean, but the numeral `0` cannot be used in a context where the expected type is\n  \u03b9\ndue to the absence of the instance above\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nunknown constant 'Set.exists_mem_of_ne_empty'\nfailed to synthesize\n  OfNat \u03b9 0\nnumerals are polymorphic in Lean, but the numeral `0` cannot be used in a context where the expected type is\n  \u03b9\ndue to the absence of the instance above\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nunknown constant 'Submodule.eq_top_of_mem'\nPlease revise the proof.",

By Cauchy's Theorem, we know that $G$ has an element of order $p$ and an element of order $q$. Let's denote these elements as $a$ and $b$, respectively.\n\nConsider the subgroup $H$ generated by $a$. Since $a$ has order $p$, the order of $H$ is $p$. Similarly, consider the subgroup $K$ generated by $b$. Since $b$ has order $q$, the order of $K$ is $q$.\n\nNow, let's consider the intersection of $H$ and $K$, denoted as $H \\cap K$. Since $H$ has order $p$ and $K$ has order $q$, the order of $H \\cap K$ must divide both $p$ and $q$. But the only positive integer that divides both $p$ and $q$ is $1$, since $p$ and $q$ are prime. Therefore, $H \\cap K$ has order $1$.\n\nThis implies that $H$ and $K$ are disjoint subgroups of $G$, and their union is the entire group $G$. In other words, $G = H \\cup K$.\n\nNow, let's consider the action of $G$ on the set of left cosets of $H$ by left multiplication. This action is a homomorphism from $G$ to the symmetric group $S_n$, where $n$ is the number of left cosets of $H$. Since $G$ has order $p q$, the image of this homomorphism is a subgroup of $S_n$ of order $p q$.\n\nBy the Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem, the image of this homomorphism is a transitive subgroup of $S_n$. But the only transitive subgroups of $S_n$ of order $p q$ are the Frobenius groups $F_{p,q}$, which are known to be non-simple.\n\nTherefore, the image of this homomorphism is a non-simple subgroup of $S_n$, and hence $G$ has a non-trivial normal subgroup, namely the kernel of this homomorphism.\n\nThis completes the proof that no group of order $p q$, where $p$ and $q$ are prime, is simple.\nPrevious attempt failed with: type mismatch\n  hp\nhas type\n  Prime p : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  p.Prime : Prop\ntype mismatch\n  hq\nhas type\n  Prime q : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  q.Prime : Prop\nunknown identifier 'exists_prime_order_of_dvd_card'\nrcases tactic failed: x\u271d : ?m.897 is not an inductive datatype\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  Fintype \u21a5H\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nunknown identifier 'exists_prime_order_of_dvd_card'\nfailed to synthesize\n  Fintype \u21a5H\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nunknown identifier 'exists_prime_order_of_dvd_card'\nunknown identifier 'normal_of_index_eq_prime'\nunknown identifier 'normal_of_index_eq_prime'\nunknown identifier 'eq_bot_of_card_eq_one'\nunknown identifier 'eq_top_of_card_eq_card_group'\ntactic 'apply' failed, failed to unify\n  IsSimpleGroup G\nwith\n  false = true\nG : Type u_1\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : Group G\ninst\u271d : Fintype G\np q : \u2115\nhp : Prime p\nhq : Prime q\nhG : card G = p * q\nh_simple : IsSimpleGroup G\nH_p : Subgroup G\nh_H_p : sorryAx \u2115 true = p\nH_q : Subgroup G\nh_H_q : sorryAx \u2115 true = q\nh_H_p_normal : H_p.Normal\nh_H_q_normal : H_q.Normal\nh_intersection : H_p \u2293 H_q = \u22a5\nh_union : H_p \u2294 H_q = \u22a4\n\u22a2 false = true\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  Fintype \u21a5H\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nunknown identifier 'exists_prime_order_of_dvd_card'\nfailed to synthesize\n  Fintype \u21a5H\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nunknown identifier 'exists_prime_order_of_dvd_card'\nunknown identifier 'normal_of_index_eq_prime'\nunknown identifier 'normal_of_index_eq_prime'\nunknown identifier 'eq_bot_of_card_eq_one'\nunknown identifier 'eq_top_of_card_eq_card_group'\nfunction expected at\n  h_simple\nterm has type\n  IsSimpleGroup G\nPlease revise the proof.",

This tells us that any group of order 224 must have a subgroup of order 2^5 (by Cauchy's Theorem) and a subgroup of order 7 (also by Cauchy's Theorem).\n\nNow, let's consider the subgroup of order 2^5. This subgroup is not simple because it has a non-trivial center (the center of a group is the set of elements that commute with every element of the group). In this case, the center of the subgroup of order 2^5 is a subgroup of order 2^3, because the center of a p-group (a group whose order is a power of a prime) is always a subgroup of order p^(k-1), where k is the power of the prime in the order of the group.\n\nHowever, we can further subdivide the subgroup of order 2^5 into smaller subgroups. Specifically, we can find a subgroup of order 2^4 within the subgroup of order 2^5. This subgroup of order 2^4 is not simple because it has a non-trivial center (the center of a p-group is always a subgroup of order p^(k-1)).\n\nNow, let's consider the subgroup of order 7. This subgroup is cyclic (because it has prime order), and any cyclic group of order 7 is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 7 itself. This means that the subgroup of order 7 is simple, but we can still use it to find a non-trivial normal subgroup of the group of order 224.\n\nConsider the direct product of the subgroup of order 2^5 and the subgroup of order 7. This direct product is a normal subgroup of the group of order 224 because it is a subgroup of index 2 (the index of a subgroup is the number of cosets of the subgroup in the group). The direct product of the subgroup of order 2^5 and the subgroup of order 7 has order 2^5 * 7 = 224, so it is a normal subgroup of order 224.\n\nHowever, we can further subdivide the direct product of the subgroup of order 2^5 and the subgroup of order 7 into smaller subgroups.

We can assume that a and b are not both zero, because if they were, then the element a + b\u03c9 would be zero, which contradicts the fact that I is nonzero.\n\nNow, let's consider the norm of the element a + b\u03c9, denoted as N(a + b\u03c9). The norm of a Gauss integer is defined as the product of the Gauss integer and its conjugate. In this case, the conjugate of a + b\u03c9 is a - b\u03c9, so we have:\n\nN(a + b\u03c9) = (a + b\u03c9)(a - b\u03c9) = a^2 - ab\u03c9 + ab\u03c9 - b^2\u03c9^2 = a^2 + b^2\n\nSince a and b are integers, the norm N(a + b\u03c9) is also an integer.

Therefore, I contains a nonzero integer.\n\nThis completes the proof, which shows that every nonzero ideal in the ring of Gauss integers contains a nonzero integer.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unsolved goals\ncase h\nI : Ideal GaussianInt\nx : GaussianInt\nhI : \u00acI = \u22a5\nh' : \u2200 x \u2208 I, x = 0\n\u22a2 x \u2208 I \u2194 x = 0\nunsolved goals\ncase h.right\nI : Ideal GaussianInt\nhI : I \u2260 \u22a5\nx : \u21a5I\nhx : x \u2260 0\n\u22a2 (\u2191x).im = 0\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: simp made no progress\nunknown identifier 'b'\npush_neg made no progress\nunsolved goals\ncase h.left\nI : Ideal GaussianInt\nhI : I \u2260 \u22a5\na : GaussianInt\nha : a \u2208 I\nhb : \u00aca = 0\nN : GaussianInt := a ^ 2 + sorryAx GaussianInt true ^ 2\nhN : N \u2260 0\nh : \u27e8a, ha\u27e9 = 0\n\u22a2 False\nunsolved goals\ncase h.right\nI : Ideal GaussianInt\nhI : I \u2260 \u22a5\na : GaussianInt\nha : a \u2208 I\nhb : a \u2260 0\nN : GaussianInt := a ^ 2 + sorryAx GaussianInt true ^ 2\nhN : N \u2260 0\n\u22a2 a.im = 0\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unsolved goals\ncase h.mpr\nI : Ideal GaussianInt\nhI : I \u2260 \u22a5\nh' : \u2200 a \u2208 I, a = 0\nx : GaussianInt\nhx : x = 0\n\u22a2 x \u2208 I\npush_neg made no progress\nunsolved goals\ncase h.left\nI : Ideal GaussianInt\nhI : I \u2260 \u22a5\na : GaussianInt\nhaI : a \u2208 I\nha0 : \u00aca = 0\nN : GaussianInt := a ^ 2 + \u2191a.im ^ 2\nhN : N \u2260 0\nhz : \u27e8a, haI\u27e9 = 0\n\u22a2 False\nunsolved goals\ncase h.right\nI : Ideal GaussianInt\nhI : I \u2260 \u22a5\na : GaussianInt\nhaI : a \u2208 I\nha0 : a \u2260 0\nN : GaussianInt := a ^ 2 + \u2191a.im ^ 2\nhN : N \u2260 0\n\u22a2 a.im = 0\nPlease revise the proof.",

Since $x$ is in $I J$, it can be expressed as a finite sum of products of elements from $I$ and $J$, i.e., $x = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i b_i$, where $a_i \\in I$ and $b_i \\in J$ for all $i$. \n\nNow, since $x$ is also in $I \\cap J$, it must be in both $I$ and $J$. This means that each $a_i b_i$ is in $I$ and $J$, and therefore in $I \\cap J$. Since $I \\cap J$ is an ideal, it is closed under addition, so the sum $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i b_i$ is also in $I \\cap J$. This shows that any element in $I J$ is also in $I \\cap J$.\n\nNext, let's consider an element $y$ that belongs to $I \\cap J$. Since $y$ is in both $I$ and $J$, we can write $y = a b$, where $a \\in I$ and $b \\in J$. Now, since $I + J = R$, we can find elements $i \\in I$ and $j \\in J$ such that $i + j = 1$. Then, we have $y = a b = a (i + j) b = a i b + a j b$. \n\nSince $a i b$ is in $I J$ (because $a \\in I$ and $i b \\in J$), and $a j b$ is in $I J$ (because $a \\in I$ and $j b \\in J$), we have $y = a i b + a j b \\in I J$.

By the Rational Root Theorem, any rational root must be of the form $p/q$, where $p$ is a factor of the constant term $-9$ and $q$ is a factor of the leading coefficient $1$. Since the only factors of $-9$ in $\\mathbb{F}_{31}$ are $1, -1, 3, -3, 9, -9$, we only need to check these values as potential roots.\n\nWe can easily verify that none of these values are roots of the polynomial $x^3 - 9$ by plugging them in and checking that the result is not zero. For example, $1^3 - 9 = -8 \\neq 0$, $(-1)^3 - 9 = -10 \\neq 0$, and so on.\n\nSince none of the possible rational roots are actually roots of the polynomial, we can conclude that $x^3 - 9$ has no linear factors in $\\mathbb{F}_{31}[x]$.\n\nNext, let's consider the possibility that $x^3 - 9$ has a quadratic factor in $\\mathbb{F}_{31}[x]$.

Since $N$ is not divisible by any of the primes $p_1, p_2, ..., p_n$, any factor of $N$ must be of the form $4k+1$ or $4k+3$, where $k$ is a positive integer.\n\nHowever, if $N$ has a factor of the form $4k+1$, then it must also have a factor of the form $4k+3$, since the product of two numbers of the form $4k+1$ or $4k+3$ will always be of the form $4k+1$. But this is impossible, since $N$ is of the form $4p_1p_2...p_n + 1$, which is clearly not divisible by any number of the form $4k+3$.\n\nTherefore, $N$ must have a factor of the form $4k+3$. But this factor must be a prime number, since $N$ is not divisible by any of the primes $p_1, p_2, ..., p_n$. And since this prime number is of the form $4k+3$, it is congruent to $-1$ (modulo $4$).\n\nThis is a contradiction, since we assumed that there were only finitely many primes congruent to $-1$ (modulo $4$). Therefore, our assumption must be false, and there are indeed infinitely many primes congruent to $-1$ (modulo $4$).\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  Fintype \u2191primes\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  Fintype \u2191primes\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\napplication type mismatch\n  h h_prime_factor\nargument\n  h_prime_factor\nhas type\n  \u2203 p, p.Prime \u2227 p \u2223 N' \u2227 p + 1 \u2261 0 [MOD 4] : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u2203 p \u2265 N, p.Prime \u2227 p + 1 \u2261 0 [MOD 4] : Prop\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: \nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: \nPlease revise the proof.",

We know that $K$ has a finite number of elements, and it contains a multiplicative identity element, denoted as $1$. Additionally, every nonzero element in $K$ has a multiplicative inverse.\n\nNow, let's consider the product of all the nonzero elements in $K$. We can denote this product as $P$. Since $K$ is a field, it must contain the additive inverse of every element, including the multiplicative inverse of $1$, which is $1$ itself. This means that $-1$ is also an element of $K$.\n\nWe can now consider the equation $x \\cdot P = 1$, where $x$ is any nonzero element in $K$. Multiplying both sides of the equation by $x^{-1}$, we get $P = x^{-1}$. This shows that every nonzero element in $K$ is a multiplicative inverse of $P$.\n\nHowever, we know that $K$ has a finite number of elements, and each element can be paired with its multiplicative inverse. This means that the product of all the nonzero elements in $K$ must be equal to the product of all the multiplicative inverses of these elements.\n\nSince each element is paired with its multiplicative inverse, the product of all the elements and their inverses must be equal to the product of the elements and their inverses, but in reverse order. This means that the product of all the nonzero elements in $K$ must be equal to the product of the multiplicative inverses of the elements, which is equal to the product of the elements themselves.\n\nNow, let's consider the product of all the elements in $K$, including $0$. We can denote this product as $Q$. Since $0$ is the additive identity, multiplying any element by $0$ results in $0$. This means that $Q = 0$.\n\nHowever, we also know that the product of all the nonzero elements in $K$ is equal to the product of the elements themselves. This means that $P = Q$. But we also know that $Q = 0$, which means that $P = 0$.\n\nThis seems to be a contradiction, but it's not. The reason is that we're considering the product of all the elements in $K$, including $0$. When we multiply $0$ by any element, the result is $0$. This means that the product of all the elements in $K$ is $0$, not $-1$.\n\nHowever, we're interested in the product of the nonzero elements in $K$. Let's consider the equation $x \\cdot P = 1$, where $x$ is any nonzero element in $K$. We know that $P = 0$, but we also know that $x \\cdot 0 = 0$. This means that $x \\cdot P = 0$, not $1$.\n\nBut wait, we're considering the equation $x \\cdot P = 1$, where $x$ is any nonzero element in $K$. This means that $x$ is not equal to $0$. And we know that $x \\cdot 0 = 0$, not $1$. This means that the equation $x \\cdot P = 1$ is not true for all nonzero elements in $K$.\n\nHowever, we know that the equation $x \\cdot P = 1$ is true for some nonzero elements in $K$. In fact, we know that $-1$ is a nonzero element in $K$, and we know that $(-1) \\cdot P = 1$. This means that $P = -1$.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the product of the nonzero elements of $K$ is indeed $-1$.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

Since $\\operatorname{dim} W_i = 2$, it's an invariant subspace under $T$.\n\nAs before, we can conclude that $T(v_i)$ is a scalar multiple of $v_i$ for each $i$. But then, since $T$ is a linear transformation, we can write:\n\n$$T(v) = T\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n c_i v_i\\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^n c_i T(v_i) = \\sum_{i=1}^n c_i (k_i v_i) = \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n k_i c_i\\right) v$$\n\nwhere $k_i$ are scalar constants. This shows that $T(v)$ is a scalar multiple of $v$ for any non-zero vector $v$ in $V$.\n\nFinally, since $T$ is a linear transformation, we can conclude that $T$ is a scalar multiple of the identity operator. This is because the only way for $T(v)$ to be a scalar multiple of $v$ for all non-zero vectors $v$ is for $T$ to be a scalar multiple of the identity operator.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'let'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'let'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'let'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

In the context of a group $G$, the notation $|a b|$ typically denotes the result of the group operation applied to elements $a$ and $b$. \n\nGiven this, we want to show that the order in which we perform the group operation does not affect the result. In other words, we want to prove that $a b = b a$ for all $a, b \\in G$.\n\nHowever, the problem statement does not explicitly state that the group operation is commutative.

This means that the operation in $A \\times B$ satisfies the properties of an abelian group, including closure, associativity, the existence of an identity element, the existence of inverse elements, and commutativity.\n\nNow, let's consider the elements of $A \\times B$.

A group is a set of elements with a binary operation (in this case, function composition) that satisfies four properties: closure, associativity, the existence of an identity element, and the existence of inverse elements.\n\nLet's start by showing that $S_{\\Omega}$ satisfies these properties.\n\n## Closure\n\nFor any two elements $f, g \\in S_{\\Omega}$, we need to show that their composition $f \\circ g$ is also an element of $S_{\\Omega}$. Since $f$ and $g$ are both permutations of the set $\\Omega$, their composition is also a permutation of $\\Omega$. Therefore, $f \\circ g \\in S_{\\Omega}$, and we have closure.\n\n## Associativity\n\nFor any three elements $f, g, h \\in S_{\\Omega}$, we need to show that $(f \\circ g) \\circ h = f \\circ (g \\circ h)$. This follows from the associativity of function composition, which is a well-known property of functions.\n\n## Identity Element\n\nWe need to show that there exists an element $e \\in S_{\\Omega}$ such that for any $f \\in S_{\\Omega}$, $f \\circ e = e \\circ f = f$. The identity element is the permutation that maps each element of $\\Omega$ to itself, which we can denote as $id$.

The inverse of $f$ is the permutation that maps each element of $\\Omega$ to its image under $f$. We can denote this permutation as $f^{-1}$. Clearly, $f \\circ f^{-1} = f^{-1} \\circ f = id$.\n\nNow that we have shown that $S_{\\Omega}$ satisfies the properties of a group, we need to show that it has an infinite number of elements.\n\n## Infinite Number of Elements\n\nTo show that $S_{\\Omega}$ has an infinite number of elements, we can show that there are an infinite number of permutations of $\\Omega$. Consider the set of permutations that map the element $1$ to a different element of $\\Omega$. There are an infinite number of such permutations, since there are an infinite number of elements of $\\Omega$ that $1$ can be mapped to. Similarly, there are an infinite number of permutations that map the element $2$ to a different element of $\\Omega$, and so on. Therefore, there are an infinite number of elements of $S_{\\Omega}$.\n\nSince we have shown that $S_{\\Omega}$ satisfies the properties of a group and has an infinite number of elements, we can conclude that $S_{\\Omega}$ is an infinite group.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  Infinite (Equiv.Perm \u2115)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  Infinite (Equiv.Perm \u2115)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  Infinite (Equiv.Perm \u2115)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nPlease revise the proof.",

This means that $\\sigma$ is a bijective homomorphism from $G$ to itself, and it's the only automorphism that fixes the identity.\n\nNow, we're given that $\\sigma^{2}$ is the identity map from $G$ to $G$. This implies that applying $\\sigma$ twice in a row has the same effect as doing nothing, i.e., $\\sigma^{2}(g) = g$ for all $g \\in G$.\n\nLet's consider two arbitrary elements $a, b \\in G$. We want to show that $ab = ba$, i.e., $G$ is abelian. To do this, we'll use the given conditions and the properties of automorphisms.\n\nSince $\\sigma$ is an automorphism, it preserves the group operation. This means that $\\sigma(ab) = \\sigma(a)\\sigma(b)$ for all $a, b \\in G$. Now, let's apply $\\sigma$ to both sides of this equation:\n\n$\\sigma(\\sigma(ab)) = \\sigma(\\sigma(a)\\sigma(b))$\n\nUsing the fact that $\\sigma^{2}$ is the identity map, we can simplify the left-hand side:\n\n$\\sigma^{2}(ab) = \\sigma(ab)$\n\nSimilarly, we can simplify the right-hand side:\n\n$\\sigma^{2}(a)\\sigma^{2}(b) = \\sigma(a)\\sigma(b)$\n\nSince $\\sigma^{2}$ is the identity map, we know that $\\sigma^{2}(a) = a$ and $\\sigma^{2}(b) = b$. Substituting these values, we get:\n\n$a\\sigma(b) = \\sigma(a)b$\n\nNow, let's apply $\\sigma$ to both sides of this equation:\n\n$\\sigma(a\\sigma(b)) = \\sigma(\\sigma(a)b)$\n\nUsing the fact that $\\sigma$ is an automorphism, we can simplify the left-hand side:\n\n$\\sigma(a)\\sigma^{2}(b) = \\sigma(a)\\sigma(b)$\n\nSimilarly, we can simplify the right-hand side:\n\n$\\sigma^{2}(a)\\sigma(b) = \\sigma(a)\\sigma(b)$\n\nSince $\\sigma^{2}$ is the identity map, we know that $\\sigma^{2}(a) = a$ and $\\sigma^{2}(b) = b$. Substituting these values, we get:\n\n$a\\sigma(b) = a\\sigma(b)$\n\nThis equation is true for all $a, b \\in G$. Now, let's consider the case where $a = b$. In this case, we have:\n\n$a\\sigma(b) = a\\sigma(a)$\n\nUsing the fact that $\\sigma$ is an automorphism, we can simplify the right-hand side:\n\n$a\\sigma(b) = a\\sigma(a)$\n\nSince $\\sigma$ is the only automorphism that fixes the identity, we know that $\\sigma(a) = a$ if and only if $a = 1$. Therefore, if $a \\neq 1$, we have:\n\n$a\\sigma(b) \\neq a\\sigma(a)$\n\nThis implies that:\n\n$a\\sigma(b) = a\\sigma(a)$\n\nis true if and only if $a = 1$ or $b = 1$.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where $a \\neq 1$ and $b \\neq 1$. In this case, we have:\n\n$a\\sigma(b) \\neq a\\sigma(a)$\n\nUsing the fact that $\\sigma$ is an automorphism, we can simplify the left-hand side:\n\n$a\\sigma(b) = \\sigma(a)b$\n\nSimilarly, we can simplify the right-hand side:\n\n$a\\sigma(a) = \\sigma(a)a$\n\nSince $\\sigma$ is an automorphism, we know that $\\sigma(a) \\neq 1$ if $a \\neq 1$. Therefore, we have:\n\n$\\sigma(a)b \\neq \\sigma(a)a$\n\nThis implies that:\n\n$\\sigma(a)b = \\sigma(a)a$\n\nis true if and only if $b = a$.\n\nNow, let's combine the results from the previous cases. We have:\n\n$a\\sigma(b) = a\\sigma(a)$\n\nis true if and only if $a = 1$ or $b = 1$.\n\nSimilarly, we have:\n\n$\\sigma(a)b = \\sigma(a)a$\n\nis true if and only if $b = a$.\n\nUsing these two results, we can conclude that:\n\n$a\\sigma(b) = \\sigma(a)b$\n\nis true for all $a, b \\in G$.\n\nNow, let's apply $\\sigma$ to both sides of this equation:\n\n$\\sigma(a\\sigma(b)) = \\sigma(\\sigma(a)b)$\n\nUsing the fact that $\\sigma$ is an automorphism, we can simplify the left-hand side:\n\n$\\sigma(a)\\sigma^{2}(b) = \\sigma(a)\\sigma(b)$\n\nSimilarly, we can simplify the right-hand side:\n\n$\\sigma^{2}(a)\\sigma(b) = \\sigma(a)\\sigma(b)$\n\nSince $\\sigma^{2}$ is the identity map, we know that $\\sigma^{2}(a) = a$ and $\\sigma^{2}(b) = b$.

This condition implies that if $x$ is in $H$, then its reciprocal $1/x$ is also in $H$.\n\nNow, let's assume that $H$ is not equal to the set of all rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. We want to show that this assumption leads to a contradiction, which would imply that $H$ must be equal to $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nSuppose $H$ is not equal to $\\mathbb{Q}$. Then, there exists a nonzero rational number $x$ that is not in $H$. Since $x$ is a rational number, it can be expressed as the ratio of two integers $a$ and $b$, where $b$ is nonzero. \n\nWe can write $x = a/b$. Since $x$ is not in $H$, we know that $1/x = b/a$ is also not in $H$. However, this is a contradiction because $1/x = b/a$ is a nonzero rational number, and by the given condition, $1/x$ should be in $H$.\n\nTo resolve this contradiction, we need to consider the case where $H$ contains a nonzero rational number $x$. If $x$ is in $H$, then its reciprocal $1/x$ is also in $H$. This implies that $H$ contains all nonzero rational numbers of the form $1/x$, where $x$ is a nonzero rational number in $H$.\n\nNow, let's consider the set of all rational numbers of the form $x + 1/x$, where $x$ is a nonzero rational number in $H$. This set is closed under addition because if $x$ and $y$ are in $H$, then $x + 1/x$ and $y + 1/y$ are also in $H$, and their sum $(x + 1/x) + (y + 1/y)$ is equal to $(x + y) + (1/x + 1/y)$, which is also in $H$.\n\nSince $H$ is a subgroup, it is closed under addition. Therefore, the set of all rational numbers of the form $x + 1/x$, where $x$ is a nonzero rational number in $H$, is a subset of $H$. But this set is equal to $\\mathbb{Q}$ because every rational number can be expressed as the sum of a rational number and its reciprocal.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that $H$ contains a subset that is equal to $\\mathbb{Q}$. This implies that $H$ is equal to $\\mathbb{Q}$, which is a contradiction to our initial assumption that $H$ is not equal to $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nHence, we conclude that $H$ must be equal to $\\mathbb{Q}$ or the trivial subgroup $\\{0\\}$.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unsolved goals\ncase pos.h.h\nH : AddSubgroup \u211a\nx : \u211a\nhH : x \u2208 H \u2192 1 / x \u2208 H\nhx : x = 0\ny : \u211a\n\u22a2 y \u2208 H \u2194 y = 0\ntype mismatch\n  x * y\nhas type\n  \u211a : outParam Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  y \u2208 H : Prop\nno goals to be solved\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unsolved goals\ncase pos.h.h\nH : AddSubgroup \u211a\nx : \u211a\nhH : x \u2208 H \u2192 1 / x \u2208 H\nhx : x = 0\ny : \u211a\n\u22a2 y \u2208 H\napplication type mismatch\n  hH hy\nargument\n  hy\nhas type\n  y \u2208 H : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  x \u2208 H : Prop\ninvalid field 'mul_mem', the environment does not contain 'AddSubgroup.mul_mem'\n  H\nhas type\n  AddSubgroup \u211a\ninvalid field 'mul_mem', the environment does not contain 'AddSubgroup.mul_mem'\n  H\nhas type\n  AddSubgroup \u211a\ninvalid field 'mul_mem', the environment does not contain 'AddSubgroup.mul_mem'\n  H\nhas type\n  AddSubgroup \u211a\napplication type mismatch\n  sub_eq_zero.mpr h12\nargument\n  h12\nhas type\n  0 \u2208 H : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  y = 0 : Prop\nsimp made no progress\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unsolved goals\ncase pos.h.h\nH : AddSubgroup \u211a\nx : \u211a\nhH : x \u2208 H \u2192 1 / x \u2208 H\nhx : x = 0\ny : \u211a\n\u22a2 y \u2208 H\ninvalid field 'mul_mem', the environment does not contain 'AddSubgroup.mul_mem'\n  H\nhas type\n  AddSubgroup \u211a\ntype mismatch\n  this\nhas type\n  y * x \u2208 H : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  y \u2208 \u22a5 : Prop\nsimp made no progress\nPlease revise the proof.",

This set is non-empty since $H$ itself is a subgroup of $G$ containing $H$. We can partially order this set by inclusion, meaning that for any two subgroups $M_1$ and $M_2$ in the set, $M_1 \\leq M_2$ if and only if $M_1 \\subseteq M_2$.\n\nNow, consider the set of all chains in this partially ordered set. A chain is a subset of the set of all subgroups containing $H$ such that for any two subgroups $M_1$ and $M_2$ in the chain, either $M_1 \\subseteq M_2$ or $M_2 \\subseteq M_1$. The set of all chains is non-empty since the chain containing only $H$ is in the set.\n\nSince $G$ is a finite group, the set of all subgroups containing $H$ is also finite. Therefore, the set of all chains in this partially ordered set is also finite.\n\nBy Zorn's Lemma, which states that if every chain in a partially ordered set has an upper bound, then the set has a maximal element, we can conclude that the set of all chains in this partially ordered set has a maximal element.\n\nLet $M$ be the maximal element of the set of all chains. Then $M$ is a subgroup of $G$ containing $H$ and is maximal with respect to inclusion.\n\nWe claim that $M$ is a maximal subgroup of $G$. To see this, suppose that $N$ is a subgroup of $G$ containing $M$. Then $N$ is also a chain in the partially ordered set, and since $M$ is maximal with respect to inclusion, $N = M$. Therefore, the only subgroups of $G$ containing $M$ are $M$ and $G$, and $M$ is a maximal subgroup of $G$.\n\nThis completes the proof that if $H$ is a proper subgroup of the finite group $G$ then there is a maximal subgroup of $G$ containing $H$.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'let'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'let'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'let'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

We want to show that $H$ must be of the form $\\left\\langle x^{p}\\right\\rangle$ for some prime $p$ dividing $n$. Since $H$ is a subgroup of $G$, it must be cyclic, generated by some element $y \\in G$. Because $H$ is maximal, the order of $y$ must be a divisor of $n$. Let's say the order of $y$ is $k$, where $k$ divides $n$. Then, we have $y^k = e$, where $e$ is the identity element of $G$. Since $G$ is cyclic, we can write $e = x^n$. Therefore, we have $y^k = x^n$. This implies that $y$ is a power of $x$, say $y = x^m$. Then, we have $x^{mk} = e$, which means that the order of $x^m$ is $k$. Since $k$ divides $n$, we can write $k = p \\cdot q$, where $p$ and $q$ are positive integers and $p$ is a prime divisor of $n$.

In other words, $H \\cap K$ contains only the identity element, which is the definition of the trivial subgroup, denoted as $1$.\n\nHence, we have shown that $H \\cap K = 1$, as required.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'orderOf_dvd_card_univ'\nunknown identifier 'orderOf_dvd_card_univ'\napplication type mismatch\n  Nat.Coprime.dvd_of_dvd_mul_left hHK\nargument\n  hHK\nhas type\n  (card \u21a5H).Coprime (card \u21a5K) : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  (orderOf x).Coprime ?m.3628 : Prop\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'orderOf_dvd_card_univ'\nunknown identifier 'orderOf_dvd_card_univ'\napplication type mismatch\n  Nat.Coprime.dvd_of_dvd_mul_left hHK\nargument\n  hHK\nhas type\n  (card \u21a5H).Coprime (card \u21a5K) : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  (orderOf x).Coprime ?m.3910 : Prop\napplication type mismatch\n  Exists.intro this\nargument\n  this\nhas type\n  orderOf x \u2223 card \u21a5K : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u2115 : Type\nunsolved goals\nG : Type u_1\ninst\u271d\u00b2 : Group G\nH K : Subgroup G\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : Fintype \u21a5H\ninst\u271d : Fintype \u21a5K\nhHK : (card \u21a5H).Coprime (card \u21a5K)\nx : G\nhx : x \u2208 H \u2227 x \u2208 K\nthis\u271d : orderOf x \u2223 card \u21a5H\nthis : orderOf x \u2223 card \u21a5K\n\u22a2 x = 1\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'orderOf_dvd_card_univ'\nunknown identifier 'orderOf_dvd_card_univ'\napplication type mismatch\n  Nat.Coprime.dvd_of_dvd_mul_left hHK\nargument\n  hHK\nhas type\n  (card \u21a5H).Coprime (card \u21a5K) : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  (orderOf x).Coprime ?m.3627 : Prop\napplication type mismatch\n  Nat.dvd_trans h1 (Nat.gcd_dvd_left (card \u21a5H) (card \u21a5K))\nargument\n  Nat.gcd_dvd_left (card \u21a5H) (card \u21a5K)\nhas type\n  (card \u21a5H).gcd (card \u21a5K) \u2223 card \u21a5H : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  card \u21a5H \u2223 ?m.3627 * 1 : Prop\nunsolved goals\nG : Type u_1\ninst\u271d\u00b2 : Group G\nH K : Subgroup G\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : Fintype \u21a5H\ninst\u271d : Fintype \u21a5K\nhHK : (card \u21a5H).Coprime (card \u21a5K)\nx : G\nhx : x \u2208 H \u2227 x \u2208 K\nh1 : orderOf x \u2223 card \u21a5H\nh2 : orderOf x \u2223 card \u21a5K\n\u22a2 x \u2208 \u22a5\nPlease revise the proof.",

We're working with the multiplicative group $(\\mathbb{Z} / p \\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$, which consists of all integers $a$ such that $1 \\leq a \\leq p-1$ and $\\gcd(a, p) = 1$. This group is closed under multiplication modulo $p$, and it has a certain number of elements, which we'll call $n$.\n\nNow, let's consider the function $f: (\\mathbb{Z} / p \\mathbb{Z})^{\\times} \\to (\\mathbb{Z} / p \\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$ defined by $f(a) = a^p$. We want to show that $f(a) \\equiv a(\\bmod p)$ for all $a \\in (\\mathbb{Z} / p \\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$.\n\nTo do this, we'll use Lagrange's Theorem, which states that if $G$ is a finite group and $H$ is a subgroup of $G$, then the order of $H$ divides the order of $G$. In our case, we have a group $G = (\\mathbb{Z} / p \\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$ and a subgroup $H = \\{a \\in (\\mathbb{Z} / p \\mathbb{Z})^{\\times} \\mid a^p \\equiv 1(\\bmod p)\\}$.\n\nNotice that $H$ is a subgroup of $G$ because it's closed under multiplication modulo $p$ and contains the identity element $1$. Moreover, $H$ has order $p-1$ because there are $p-1$ elements in $(\\mathbb{Z} / p \\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$ that satisfy $a^p \\equiv 1(\\bmod p)$.\n\nNow, we can apply Lagrange's Theorem to conclude that the order of $H$ divides the order of $G$. Since the order of $G$ is $p-1$ and the order of $H$ is also $p-1$, we have that the order of $H$ divides $p-1$.\n\nBut this means that $H$ must be the entire group $G$, because there's no other subgroup of $G$ with order $p-1$. Therefore, every element $a \\in (\\mathbb{Z} / p \\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$ satisfies $a^p \\equiv 1(\\bmod p)$.\n\nHowever, we want to show that $a^p \\equiv a(\\bmod p)$, not $a^p \\equiv 1(\\bmod p)$. To get around this, we can use the fact that $a^p \\equiv 1(\\bmod p)$ implies $a^p - 1 \\equiv 0(\\bmod p)$. Factoring the left-hand side, we get $(a-1)(a^{p-1} + a^{p-2} + \\dots + a + 1) \\equiv 0(\\bmod p)$.\n\nSince $a \\in (\\mathbb{Z} / p \\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$, we know that $a$ is not congruent to $1$ modulo $p$. Therefore, the factor $a-1$ is not congruent to $0$ modulo $p$. This means that the other factor, $a^{p-1} + a^{p-2} + \\dots + a + 1$, must be congruent to $0$ modulo $p$.\n\nBut this is exactly what we want to show: $a^{p-1} + a^{p-2} + \\dots + a + 1 \\equiv 0(\\bmod p)$ is equivalent to $a^p \\equiv a(\\bmod p)$.

        "informal_proof": "# Informal Proof:\n\nLet's break down the problem into smaller, more manageable parts. We're given a group $G$ and a normal subgroup $H$ of prime index $p$. Our goal is to show that for any subgroup $K$ of $G$, either $K$ is contained in $H$ or $G$ is the product of $H$ and $K$, with the additional property that the index of $K$ in the intersection of $K$ and $H$ is $p$.\n\nFirst, let's consider the case where $K$ is contained in $H$. In this scenario, it's clear that $K \\leq H$, and we're done.\n\nNow, let's assume that $K$ is not contained in $H$. Since $H$ is a normal subgroup of $G$, we know that $H$ is closed under conjugation by elements of $G$. This means that for any $k \\in K$ and $h \\in H$, the element $h^{-1}kh$ is also in $H$.\n\nConsider the set of all elements of the form $h^{-1}kh$, where $k \\in K$ and $h \\in H$. This set is closed under multiplication, since if we take two elements of this form, say $h_1^{-1}k_1h_1$ and $h_2^{-1}k_2h_2$, then their product is $h_1^{-1}h_2^{-1}k_1k_2h_2h_1$, which is also in the set. Furthermore, this set is non-empty, since it contains the identity element $e = h^{-1}eh$ for any $h \\in H$.\n\nBy Lagrange's theorem, the order of this set must divide the order of $G$. Since the order of $G$ is $|G:H| \\cdot |H| = p \\cdot |H|$, the order of this set must be a multiple of $p$. But the order of this set is also equal to the index of $K$ in the intersection of $K$ and $H$, since every element of the form $h^{-1}kh$ is in $K$ and $H$, and every element of $K$ is of this form.\n\nTherefore, the index of $K$ in the intersection of $K$ and $H$ is a multiple of $p$. But since $p$ is prime, this means that the index of $K$ in the intersection of $K$ and $H$ is either $1$ or $p$. If the index is $1$, then $K$ is contained in $H$, which is a contradiction. Therefore, the index of $K$ in the intersection of $K$ and $H$ must be $p$.\n\nNow, let's show that $G = HK$. Consider the set of all elements of the form $hk$, where $h \\in H$ and $k \\in K$. This set is closed under multiplication, since if we take two elements of this form, say $h_1k_1$ and $h_2k_2$, then their product is $h_1h_2k_1k_2$. Furthermore, this set is non-empty, since it contains the identity element $e = ek$ for any $k \\in K$.\n\nSince $H$ is a normal subgroup of $G$, the set of all elements of the form $hk$ is a subgroup of $G$. But this set contains both $H$ and $K$, so it must be equal to $G$. Therefore, $G = HK$.\n\nWe've shown that if $K$ is not contained in $H$, then $G = HK$ and the index of $K$ in the intersection of $K$ and $H$ is $p$.

This means that for any prime divisor $p$ of the order of $G$, we can find an element $g \\in G$ such that the order of $g$ is $p$.\n\nNow, let's consider the order of $G$, which we'll denote by $|G|$. We want to show that for each positive divisor $n$ of $|G|$, there exists a subgroup of $G$ with order $n$.\n\nWe'll use induction on the number of prime factors of $n$. If $n$ is a prime number, then by Cauchy's Theorem, we know that $G$ has an element of order $n$, and the subgroup generated by this element has order $n$. This completes the base case of the induction.\n\nFor the inductive step, suppose that $n$ has $k$ prime factors, and that we've already shown that for any positive divisor $m$ of $|G|$ with fewer than $k$ prime factors, there exists a subgroup of $G$ with order $m$. We want to show that there exists a subgroup of $G$ with order $n$.\n\nLet $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_k$ be the prime factors of $n$.

Then each $H_i$ has order $p_i$.\n\nNow, consider the subgroup $H$ generated by the elements $g_1, g_2, \\ldots, g_k$. Since $G$ is abelian, the order of $H$ is the least common multiple of the orders of $H_1, H_2, \\ldots, H_k$, which is equal to $n$. Therefore, $H$ is a subgroup of $G$ with order $n$, as desired.\n\nThis completes the inductive step, and by induction, we've shown that for each positive divisor $n$ of $|G|$, there exists a subgroup of $G$ with order $n$.\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  @exists_prime_orderOf_dvd_card ?m.391 ?m.392 ?m.393\n    (Nat.pos_of_ne_zero (Nat.pos_iff_ne_zero.mp (Nat.pos_of_dvd_of_pos hn card_pos)))\nargument\n  Nat.pos_of_ne_zero (Nat.pos_iff_ne_zero.mp (Nat.pos_of_dvd_of_pos hn card_pos))\nhas type\n  0 < n : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u2115 : Type\ninvalid constructor \u27e8...\u27e9, expected type must be an inductive type \n  ?m.3520\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ':='; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ':='; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

One approach is to consider the intersection of all the conjugates of $H$ in $G$. This intersection is a subgroup of $H$ because it's the intersection of subgroups, and it's normal in $G$ because it's invariant under conjugation.\n\nLet's denote this intersection as $K$. Since $K$ is the intersection of all conjugates of $H$, it's contained in $H$, so we have $K \\leq H$.\n\nNext, we need to show that $|G: K| \\leq n!$. To do this, consider the following: for any $g \\in G$, the conjugate $gHg^{-1}$ is also a subgroup of $G$. Since $H$ has finite index $n$, the number of distinct conjugates of $H$ is at most $n$. This means that the number of distinct subgroups of the form $gHg^{-1}$ is at most $n$.\n\nNow, consider the cosets of $K$ in $G$.

This means that the number of cosets of $H$ in $G$ is $p$.\n\nSince $G$ is a group of order $p^{\\alpha}$, we know that the order of $H$ must divide the order of $G$. By Lagrange's theorem, the order of $H$ must be a power of $p$, say $p^{\\beta}$ for some $\\beta \\leq \\alpha$.\n\nNow, let's consider the action of $G$ on the left cosets of $H$ by left multiplication. This action gives us a homomorphism $\\phi: G \\rightarrow S_p$, where $S_p$ is the symmetric group on $p$ elements. The kernel of this homomorphism is the set of elements in $G$ that fix every left coset of $H$, which is precisely the subgroup $H$ itself.\n\nBy the first isomorphism theorem, we know that $G/H \\cong \\text{Im}(\\phi) \\leq S_p$. Since the order of $G/H$ is $p$, we know that the order of $\\text{Im}(\\phi)$ is also $p$. This means that $\\text{Im}(\\phi)$ is a subgroup of $S_p$ of order $p$.\n\nNow, we know that $S_p$ has no subgroups of order $p$ other than the cyclic subgroup generated by a single transposition. This is because any subgroup of order $p$ in $S_p$ would have to contain a transposition, and the only subgroup of $S_p$ that contains a transposition is the whole group.\n\nSince $\\text{Im}(\\phi)$ is a subgroup of $S_p$ of order $p$, we know that it must be the cyclic subgroup generated by a single transposition. This means that $\\text{Im}(\\phi)$ is a transitive subgroup of $S_p$, and therefore $G$ acts transitively on the left cosets of $H$.\n\nNow, let's consider an element $g \\in G$ and a left coset $xH$ of $H$. Since $G$ acts transitively on the left cosets of $H$, there exists an element $y \\in G$ such that $y(xH) = g(xH)$. This means that $yxH = gxH$, or equivalently, $yxg^{-1} \\in H$.\n\nSince $yxg^{-1} \\in H$, we know that $yxg^{-1} = h$ for some $h \\in H$. This means that $yx = hg$, or equivalently, $x = h^{-1}yg$. This shows that $xH = gH$, and therefore $gH$ is a left coset of $H$.\n\nSince $gH$ is a left coset of $H$, we know that $gH = xH$ for some $x \\in G$. This means that $g \\in x^{-1}Hx$, and therefore $gH = x^{-1}Hx$. This shows that $H$ is normal in $G$, and therefore every subgroup of index $p$ is normal in $G$.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  Fintype \u21a5H\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  card (?m.5015 \u29f8 ?H)\nG : Type u_1\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : Fintype G\ninst\u271d : Group G\np \u03b1 : \u2115\nhp : p.Prime\nha : \u03b1 > 0\nhG : card G = p ^ \u03b1\nH : Subgroup G\nhH : H.index = p\nthis\u271d : Fintype G\nthis : Fintype \u21a5H\n\u22a2 H.Normal\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  Fintype \u21a5H\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  card (?m.4903 \u29f8 ?H)\nG : Type u_1\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : Fintype G\ninst\u271d : Group G\np \u03b1 : \u2115\nhp : p.Prime\nha : \u03b1 > 0\nhG : card G = p ^ \u03b1\nH : Subgroup G\nhH : H.index = p\nthis\u271d : Fintype G\nthis : Fintype \u21a5H\n\u22a2 H.Normal\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  Fintype \u21a5H\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  card (?m.4903 \u29f8 ?H)\nG : Type u_1\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : Fintype G\ninst\u271d : Group G\np \u03b1 : \u2115\nhp : p.Prime\nha : \u03b1 > 0\nhG : card G = p ^ \u03b1\nH : Subgroup G\nhH : H.index = p\nthis\u271d : Fintype G\nthis : Fintype \u21a5H\n\u22a2 H.Normal\nPlease revise the proof.",

In other words, if $G$ is a finite abelian group, then it can be written as $G \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_{p_1^{n_1}} \\times \\mathbb{Z}_{p_2^{n_2}} \\times \\cdots \\times \\mathbb{Z}_{p_k^{n_k}}$, where $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_k$ are distinct primes and $n_1, n_2, \\ldots, n_k$ are positive integers.\n\nNow, let's consider the group $G$ of order $p q$, where $p$ and $q$ are distinct primes. Since $G$ is abelian, we can apply the fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups to express $G$ as a direct product of cyclic groups of prime power order.\n\nSince the order of $G$ is $p q$, the only possible way to express $G$ as a direct product of cyclic groups of prime power order is as $G \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_p \\times \\mathbb{Z}_q$ or $G \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_{p q}$.\n\nHowever, if $G \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_p \\times \\mathbb{Z}_q$, then the order of $G$ would be $p q$, but the order of the direct product $\\mathbb{Z}_p \\times \\mathbb{Z}_q$ is not $p q$. This is because the order of the direct product of two groups is the product of the orders of the groups, but in this case, the order of $\\mathbb{Z}_p$ is $p$ and the order of $\\mathbb{Z}_q$ is $q$, so the order of the direct product would be $p q$, but the order of the direct product is actually $p q$ because the groups are cyclic and the direct product of two cyclic groups of coprime order is isomorphic to the direct product of the groups.\n\nHowever, this is a contradiction because we assumed that $G \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_p \\times \\mathbb{Z}_q$. Therefore, we must have $G \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_{p q}$.\n\nSince $G \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_{p q}$, we can conclude that $G$ is cyclic, because $\\mathbb{Z}_{p q}$ is a cyclic group of order $p q$.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that if $G$ is an abelian group of order $p q$, where $p$ and $q$ are distinct primes, then $G$ is cyclic.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

The symmetric group S3 has six elements: e (the identity), (12), (13), (23), (123), and (132).\n\nNow, let's consider the subgroup H of S3 that consists of all even permutations. This subgroup H has three elements: e, (123), and (132). \n\nWe can show that H is a normal subgroup of S3 by demonstrating that it is invariant under conjugation by any element of S3. For example, if we conjugate (123) by (12), we get (123) again, which is still an element of H. Similarly, if we conjugate (123) by (13), we get (132), which is also an element of H.\n\nHowever, H is not a characteristic subgroup of S3. To see why, let's consider the automorphism \u03c6 of S3 that swaps the elements (123) and (132). This automorphism \u03c6 is not the identity, so it is not an inner automorphism of S3. \n\nNow, let's apply \u03c6 to the subgroup H. We get a new subgroup \u03c6(H) that consists of the elements e, (132), and (123).

Since $56 = 2^3 \\cdot 7$, we know that the prime divisors of 56 are 2 and 7.\n\nLet's consider the Sylow 2-subgroup of the group, denoted by $P_2$. By Sylow's Theorem, the order of $P_2$ is $2^3 = 8$. Now, let's consider the Sylow 7-subgroup of the group, denoted by $P_7$. By Sylow's Theorem, the order of $P_7$ is 7.\n\nSince the order of the group is 56, which is the product of the orders of $P_2$ and $P_7$, we can conclude that $P_2$ and $P_7$ are normal subgroups of the group. This is because if two subgroups have orders that multiply to the order of the group, then they must be normal.\n\nHowever, we need to show that there exists a prime $p$ such that the Sylow $p$-subgroup is normal. Let's consider the number of Sylow 2-subgroups, denoted by $n_2$. By Sylow's Theorem, $n_2$ must be congruent to 1 modulo 2 and divide 7.

Therefore, they must be normal subgroups of the group.\n\nHowever, we still need to show that there exists a prime $p$ such that the Sylow $p$-subgroup is normal. Let's consider the intersection of $P_2$ and $P_7$, denoted by $P_2 \\cap P_7$. Since $P_2$ and $P_7$ are normal subgroups, their intersection must also be a normal subgroup.\n\nHowever, we know that the order of $P_2 \\cap P_7$ must divide both the order of $P_2$ and the order of $P_7$. Since the order of $P_2$ is 8 and the order of $P_7$ is 7, the order of $P_2 \\cap P_7$ must be 1.\n\nTherefore, $P_2 \\cap P_7$ is the trivial subgroup, which means that $P_2$ and $P_7$ have only the identity element in common.

This tells us that the prime factors of 351 are 3 and 13.\n\nNext, we'll apply Sylow's Theorem, which states that for any finite group $G$ and any prime $p$ dividing the order of $G$, there exists a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$. Furthermore, Sylow's Theorem also tells us that the number of Sylow $p$-subgroups of $G$ is congruent to 1 modulo $p$ and divides the order of $G$.\n\nLet's consider the prime factor 3. By Sylow's Theorem, there exists a Sylow 3-subgroup of our group $G$. Let's denote the number of Sylow 3-subgroups as $n_3$.

Therefore, we must have $n_{13} = 1$. This means that there is only one Sylow 13-subgroup in the group.\n\nSince there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup and only one Sylow 13-subgroup, both of these subgroups must be normal in the group. This is because the number of conjugates of a subgroup is equal to the index of the subgroup in the group, and since there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup and only one Sylow 13-subgroup, their indices must be equal to 1.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that the group has a normal Sylow 3-subgroup and a normal Sylow 13-subgroup.

Therefore, there must be exactly one Sylow 5-subgroup.\n\nSince there is only one Sylow 5-subgroup, it must be normal in $G$. This is because if a subgroup is unique, it must be invariant under conjugation, which is the definition of a normal subgroup.\n\nNow, let's consider the Sylow 7-subgroup. By Sylow's Third Theorem, the number of Sylow 7-subgroups must be congruent to 1 modulo 7 and divide $|G|/7^1 = 15$. The only possibilities for the number of Sylow 7-subgroups are 1 and 15. If there are 15 Sylow 7-subgroups, then each of them has order 7, and the union of all these subgroups would have order 105, which is a contradiction since $G$ has order 105. Therefore, there must be exactly one Sylow 7-subgroup.\n\nSince there is only one Sylow 7-subgroup, it must be normal in $G$. This is because if a subgroup is unique, it must be invariant under conjugation, which is the definition of a normal subgroup.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that $G$ has a normal Sylow 5-subgroup and a normal Sylow 7-subgroup.\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  @Sylow.exists_subgroup_card_pow_prime ?m.1428 ?m.1429 ?m.1430 h5\nargument\n  h5\nhas type\n  Nat.Prime 5 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u2115 : Type\nunsolved goals\nG : Type u_1\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : Fintype G\ninst\u271d : Group G\nhG : card G = 105\nh5 : Nat.Prime 5\nh7 : Nat.Prime 7\nh3 : Nat.Prime 3\nh105 : 105 = 3 * 5 * 7\n\u22a2 Nonempty (Sylow 5 G) \u2227 Nonempty (Sylow 7 G)\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: function expected at\n  Sylow.nonempty\nterm has type\n  Nonempty (Sylow ?m.1437 ?m.1438)\nfunction expected at\n  Sylow.nonempty\nterm has type\n  Nonempty (Sylow ?m.1640 ?m.1641)\nPlease revise the proof.",

In other words, the only normal subgroups of a simple group are the trivial subgroup $\\{e\\}$ and the group itself.\n\nNow, let's consider the prime factorization of $6545$. We can write $6545 = 5 \\cdot 1309$. \n\nNotice that $1309$ is a prime number. This is important because it tells us that $6545$ has a prime factorization with at least two distinct prime factors.\n\nNext, let's consider the Sylow theorems. The Sylow theorems are a set of results that provide information about the subgroups of a finite group. One of the Sylow theorems states that if $G$ is a finite group and $p$ is a prime number, then $G$ has a subgroup of order $p^k$, where $p^k$ is the highest power of $p$ that divides the order of $G$.\n\nIn our case, we have $p = 5$ and $p^k = 5^1 = 5$. The Sylow theorems tell us that $G$ has a subgroup of order $5$.\n\nNow, let's consider the number of Sylow $5$-subgroups in $G$. The Sylow theorems also tell us that the number of Sylow $5$-subgroups in $G$ is congruent to $1$ modulo $5$ and divides $6545/5 = 1309$.\n\nSince $1309$ is a prime number, the only possible values for the number of Sylow $5$-subgroups in $G$ are $1$ and $1309$.\n\nIf the number of Sylow $5$-subgroups in $G$ is $1$, then the Sylow $5$-subgroup is normal in $G$. But this would mean that $G$ has a proper non-trivial normal subgroup, which contradicts the assumption that $G$ is simple.\n\nOn the other hand, if the number of Sylow $5$-subgroups in $G$ is $1309$, then the Sylow $5$-subgroups are not normal in $G$. However, the intersection of all the Sylow $5$-subgroups is a normal subgroup of $G$ that contains the Sylow $5$-subgroup. This intersection is a proper non-trivial normal subgroup of $G$, which again contradicts the assumption that $G$ is simple.\n\nIn either case, we have shown that $G$ has a proper non-trivial normal subgroup, which means that $G$ is not simple.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  OfNat (Submonoid G) 5\nnumerals are polymorphic in Lean, but the numeral `5` cannot be used in a context where the expected type is\n  Submonoid G\ndue to the absence of the instance above\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nunknown constant 'Sylow.exists_prime_order_of_dvd_card'\nunknown constant 'Sylow.normal_of_one_lt_card'\nunknown identifier 'not_isSimpleGroup_of_normal'\nunsolved goals\ncase refine_1\nG : Type u_1\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : Fintype G\ninst\u271d : Group G\nhG h1 : card G = 6545\n\u22a2 Sylow 5 G \u2192 OfNat (Submonoid G) 5\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  OfNat (Submonoid G) 5\nnumerals are polymorphic in Lean, but the numeral `5` cannot be used in a context where the expected type is\n  Submonoid G\ndue to the absence of the instance above\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\ntype mismatch when assigning motive\n  fun t => h_n_5 = t \u2192 Sylow 5 G \u2192 OfNat (Submonoid G) 5\nhas type\n  Nat.card (Sylow 5 G) = 1 \u2228 Nat.card (Sylow 5 G) = 1309 \u2192 Type u_1 : Type (u_1 + 1)\nbut is expected to have type\n  Nat.card (Sylow 5 G) = 1 \u2228 Nat.card (Sylow 5 G) = 1309 \u2192 Prop : Type\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unsolved goals\nG : Type u_1\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : Fintype G\ninst\u271d : Group G\nhG : card G = 6545\nh1 : Nat.Prime 5\n\u22a2 False\nunknown constant 'Sylow.card_modEq_one_of_p_group'\nunknown constant 'Sylow.card_dvd_of_dvd'\nunknown constant 'Nat.card_ne_zero_of_fintype'\nno goals to be solved\nunsolved goals\nG : Type u_1\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : Fintype G\ninst\u271d : Group G\nhG : card G = 6545\nh1 : Nat.Prime 5\nh2 : Nat.Prime 1309\nh3 : 6545 = 5 * 1309\nh4 : Nat.card (Sylow 5 G) \u2261 1 [MOD 5]\nh5 : Nat.card (Sylow 5 G) \u2223 1309\nh7 : Nat.card (Sylow 5 G) \u2260 0\nh8 : Nat.card (Sylow 5 G) \u2260 5\nh10 : Nat.card (Sylow 5 G) = 1309\nh11 : True\n\u22a2 False\napplication type mismatch\n  Or.inl h7\nargument\n  h7\nhas type\n  Nat.card (Sylow 5 G) \u2260 0 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  Nat.card (Sylow 5 G) = 1 : Prop\nunknown constant 'Sylow.exists_prime_order_of_dvd_card'\nunknown constant 'Sylow.normal_of_one_lt_card'\napplication type mismatch\n  Subgroup.Normal (Sylow 5 G)\nargument\n  Sylow 5 G\nhas type\n  Type u_1 : Type (u_1 + 1)\nbut is expected to have type\n  Subgroup ?m.2901 : Type ?u.1882\nunknown constant 'Sylow.exists_prime_order_of_dvd_card'\nunknown constant 'Sylow.normal_of_one_lt_card'\napplication type mismatch\n  Subgroup.Normal (Sylow 5 G)\nargument\n  Sylow 5 G\nhas type\n  Type u_1 : Type (u_1 + 1)\nbut is expected to have type\n  Subgroup ?m.8692 : Type ?u.7675\nPlease revise the proof.",

In other words, the only normal subgroups of a simple group are the trivial subgroup $\\{e\\}$ and the group itself.\n\nNow, let's consider the prime factorization of 2907, which is $2907 = 3^2 \\cdot 107$. This tells us that 2907 has at least two distinct prime factors, 3 and 107.\n\nNext, we can use the fact that if a group $G$ has a prime order $p$, then the only normal subgroups of $G$ are the trivial subgroup $\\{e\\}$ and $G$ itself. However, if $G$ has a composite order, then it may have non-trivial normal subgroups.\n\nIn our case, since 2907 is a composite number with prime factors 3 and 107, we can try to find a non-trivial normal subgroup of $G$ by considering the Sylow theorems.\n\nThe Sylow theorems tell us that if $G$ is a finite group and $p$ is a prime number, then $G$ has a subgroup of order $p^k$, where $p^k$ is the highest power of $p$ dividing the order of $G$. In our case, we can use the Sylow theorems to find a subgroup of order 9 (which is a power of 3) and a subgroup of order 107.\n\nNow, let's consider the intersection of these two subgroups. Since both subgroups have order 9 and 107, respectively, their intersection must have order at least 1. However, since the order of the intersection is a divisor of both 9 and 107, it must be 1.\n\nThis means that the intersection of the two subgroups is the trivial subgroup $\\{e\\}$. However, since both subgroups are non-trivial, their intersection cannot be the trivial subgroup. Therefore, the intersection of the two subgroups must be a non-trivial subgroup of $G$.\n\nSince the intersection of the two subgroups is a non-trivial subgroup of $G$, we have found a non-trivial normal subgroup of $G$. Therefore, $G$ is not simple.\n\nIn conclusion, we have shown that if the order of a group $G$ is 2907, then $G$ is not simple.

This tells us that $462$ has at least four distinct prime divisors.\n\nNow, let's consider the subgroup $H = \\langle a \\rangle$, where $a$ is an element of order $11$ in $G$.

This means that any other $p$-subgroup of $G$ is either contained in $P$ or has a smaller order.\n\nNow, let's consider the intersection $P \\cap H$ of $P$ with any subgroup $H$ of $G$. Since $P$ is a subgroup of $G$, it's clear that $P \\cap H$ is also a subgroup of $H$.

But then $Q$ would be a $p$-subgroup of $G$ that contains $P$, which contradicts the maximality of $P$.\n\nTherefore, $P \\cap H$ is a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $H$. To show that it's unique, suppose there's another Sylow $p$-subgroup $R$ of $H$. Since $P$ is normal in $G$, it's also normal in $H$, and therefore $P \\cap H$ is normal in $H$.

This means that there exists a nonzero polynomial $q(x) \\in R[x]$ such that $p(x) q(x) = 0$. We can express $q(x)$ as $q(x) = c_{m} x^{m} + c_{m-1} x^{m-1} + \\cdots + c_{1} x + c_{0}$, where $c_{m} \\neq 0$. Now, let's consider the product $p(x) q(x)$. By expanding the product, we get a polynomial of degree $n + m$, where $n$ is the degree of $p(x)$. Since $p(x) q(x) = 0$, all the coefficients of this polynomial must be zero. In particular, the constant term of $p(x) q(x)$ is $a_{0} c_{0} = 0$. Since $c_{0}$ is nonzero, we must have $a_{0} = 0$. Similarly, the coefficient of $x^{m}$ in $p(x) q(x)$ is $a_{n} c_{m} = 0$. Since $c_{m}$ is nonzero, we must have $a_{n} = 0$. Continuing in this way, we can show that all the coefficients of $p(x)$ are zero. However, this is a contradiction, since we assumed that $p(x)$ is a nonzero polynomial. Therefore, our assumption that $p(x)$ is a zero divisor must be false.\n\nNow, let's assume that there is a nonzero $b \\in R$ such that $b p(x) = 0$. We can rewrite this equation as $p(x) = 0$ in the ring $R[x]/(b)$. In this ring, the polynomial $p(x)$ is equivalent to the zero polynomial. Therefore, $p(x)$ is a zero divisor in $R[x]/(b)$. Since $R[x]/(b)$ is a quotient ring of $R[x]$, we can conclude that $p(x)$ is also a zero divisor in $R[x]$.\n\nWe have now shown that $p(x)$ is a zero divisor in $R[x]$ if and only if there is a nonzero $b \\in R$ such that $b p(x) = 0$.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

This means that $\\varphi$ is a function from the ring $R$ to the ring $S$ that preserves the ring operations (addition and multiplication) and is onto, meaning every element in $S$ is the image of some element in $R$.\n\nNow, let's consider the center of $R$, denoted as $Z(R)$. The center of a ring is the set of elements that commute with every element in the ring. In other words, an element $a \\in R$ is in the center if and only if $a \\cdot r = r \\cdot a$ for all $r \\in R$.\n\nWe want to show that the image of the center of $R$ under $\\varphi$ is contained in the center of $S$. Let's take an arbitrary element $a \\in Z(R)$ and consider its image under $\\varphi$, denoted as $\\varphi(a) \\in S$.\n\nSince $\\varphi$ is a homomorphism, it preserves the ring operations. This means that for any $s \\in S$, we have $\\varphi(a) \\cdot \\varphi(s) = \\varphi(a \\cdot \\varphi^{-1}(s))$ and $\\varphi(s) \\cdot \\varphi(a) = \\varphi(\\varphi^{-1}(s) \\cdot a)$.\n\nNow, since $a \\in Z(R)$, we know that $a \\cdot r = r \\cdot a$ for all $r \\in R$. In particular, this holds for $r = \\varphi^{-1}(s)$, so we have $a \\cdot \\varphi^{-1}(s) = \\varphi^{-1}(s) \\cdot a$.\n\nUsing the homomorphism property, we can rewrite this as $\\varphi(a \\cdot \\varphi^{-1}(s)) = \\varphi(\\varphi^{-1}(s) \\cdot a)$. But since $\\varphi$ is a homomorphism, this is equal to $\\varphi(a) \\cdot \\varphi(s) = \\varphi(s) \\cdot \\varphi(a)$.\n\nThis shows that $\\varphi(a)$ commutes with every element $\\varphi(s) \\in S$, which means that $\\varphi(a) \\in Z(S)$.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that the image of the center of $R$ under $\\varphi$ is contained in the center of $S$.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'introN' failed, insufficient number of binders\nR : Type u_1\nS : Type u_2\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : Ring R\ninst\u271d : Ring S\n\u03c6 : R \u2192+* S\nhf : Function.Surjective \u21d1\u03c6\n\u22a2 \u21d1\u03c6 '' Set.center R \u2282 Set.center S\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'introN' failed, insufficient number of binders\nR : Type u_1\nS : Type u_2\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : Ring R\ninst\u271d : Ring S\n\u03c6 : R \u2192+* S\nhf : Function.Surjective \u21d1\u03c6\n\u22a2 \u21d1\u03c6 '' Set.center R \u2282 Set.center S\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'introN' failed, insufficient number of binders\nR : Type u_1\nS : Type u_2\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : Ring R\ninst\u271d : Ring S\n\u03c6 : R \u2192+* S\nhf : Function.Surjective \u21d1\u03c6\n\u22a2 \u21d1\u03c6 '' Set.center R \u2282 Set.center S\nPlease revise the proof.",

We claim that $S$ is non-empty. To see this, let $a \\in I$ be a nonzero element. If $a$ is not a zero divisor, then $a \\in S$. Otherwise, there exists a nonzero element $b \\in R$ such that $ab = 0$. But then $b \\in I$ and $b$ is not a zero divisor, so $b \\in S$. Therefore, $S$ is non-empty.\n\nNow, let $a \\in S$ be a nonzero element. We claim that $a$ is a greatest common divisor (GCD) of all elements in $I$. To see this, let $b \\in I$ be any nonzero element. By condition (i), there exist $r, s \\in R$ such that $a = rb + sa$. Since $a \\in I$, we have $rb, sa \\in I$. But $I$ is an ideal, so $rb + sa = a \\in I$. Therefore, $b$ is a multiple of $a$, and $a$ is a GCD of all elements in $I$.\n\nNext, we consider the sequence $a_1, a_2, a_3, \\ldots$ of elements in $I$ where $a_{i+1}$ is the GCD of $a_i$ and $a_{i+1}$ for all $i$. By condition (ii), there exists a positive integer $N$ such that $a_n$ is a unit times $a_N$ for all $n \\geq N$. We claim that $a_N$ is a GCD of all elements in $I$. To see this, let $b \\in I$ be any nonzero element. By the previous paragraph, $b$ is a multiple of $a_N$. Therefore, $a_N$ is a GCD of all elements in $I$.\n\nNow, let $b \\in I$ be any nonzero element. We want to show that $b \\in (a_N)$. Since $a_N$ is a GCD of all elements in $I$, there exist $r, s \\in R$ such that $b = ra_N + sa_N$. But then $b \\in (a_N)$, and we have shown that every nonzero element in $I$ is a multiple of $a_N$. Therefore, $I = (a_N)$, and we have shown that $R$ is a PID.\n\nNote that the key steps in the proof are the existence of a GCD for any two nonzero elements in $R$ (condition (i)), and the existence of a \"stable\" element in the sequence of GCDs (condition (ii)). These two conditions together allow us to show that every ideal in $R$ is principal, and therefore $R$ is a PID.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

This is the ring of Gaussian integers, which consists of complex numbers of the form $a + bi$, where $a$ and $b$ are integers. The operations in this ring are the usual addition and multiplication of complex numbers.\n\nNow, let's consider the quotient ring $\\mathbb{Z}[i] /(q)$. This is obtained by \"factoring out\" the ideal generated by the prime $q$. In other words, we are considering the set of equivalence classes of elements in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$ that differ by a multiple of $q$.\n\nSince $q \\equiv 3 \\bmod 4$, we know that $q$ is a prime of the form $4k + 3$. This implies that $q$ is not a square in $\\mathbb{Z}$, and therefore, it is not a square in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$ either.\n\nTo show that $\\mathbb{Z}[i] /(q)$ is a field, we need to show that every non-zero element in this ring has a multiplicative inverse. Let's consider an arbitrary non-zero element $a + bi$ in $\\mathbb{Z}[i] /(q)$. We need to find an element $c + di$ in $\\mathbb{Z}[i] /(q)$ such that $(a + bi)(c + di) \\equiv 1 \\bmod q$.\n\nSince $a + bi$ is non-zero, we know that either $a$ or $b$ is non-zero. Without loss of generality, let's assume that $a$ is non-zero. We can write $a = qk + r$, where $r$ is the remainder when $a$ is divided by $q$. Since $q \\equiv 3 \\bmod 4$, we know that $r$ can take on one of four values: $0, 1, 2,$ or $3$.\n\nNow, let's consider the element $c + di$ in $\\mathbb{Z}[i] /(q)$. We can write $c = qm + s$, where $s$ is the remainder when $c$ is divided by $q$. Since $a + bi$ is non-zero, we know that either $s$ or $t$ is non-zero.\n\nTo find the multiplicative inverse of $a + bi$, we need to find the values of $c$ and $d$ such that $(a + bi)(c + di) \\equiv 1 \\bmod q$. This is equivalent to finding the values of $c$ and $d$ such that $ac - bd \\equiv 1 \\bmod q$.\n\nSince $a = qk + r$ and $c = qm + s$, we can write $ac - bd \\equiv (qk + r)(qm + s) - (qk + r)(qm + t) \\equiv q^2km + q(rm + sk) - q^2km - q(rm + tk) \\equiv q(rm + sk - rm - tk) \\equiv q(rs - rt) \\bmod q$.\n\nSince $r$ and $s$ are the remainders when $a$ and $c$ are divided by $q$, we know that $r$ and $s$ can take on one of four values: $0, 1, 2,$ or $3$. Therefore, the value of $rs - rt$ can take on one of 16 values: $0, 1, 2, 3, -1, -2, -3, 4, 5, 6, 7, -4, -5, -6, -7$.\n\nHowever, since $q \\equiv 3 \\bmod 4$, we know that $q^2 \\equiv 1 \\bmod 4$. Therefore, the value of $q(rs - rt)$ can take on one of four values: $0, 1, 2, 3$. This implies that the value of $rs - rt$ can take on one of four values: $0, 1, 2, 3$.\n\nSince $rs - rt$ can take on one of four values, we know that there are four possible values for the pair $(r, s)$. Therefore, there are four possible values for the pair $(c, d)$.\n\nThis implies that there are four possible values for the element $c + di$ in $\\mathbb{Z}[i] /(q)$. Therefore, the quotient ring $\\mathbb{Z}[i] /(q)$ has $q^2$ elements.\n\nTo show that $\\mathbb{Z}[i] /(q)$ is a field, we need to show that every non-zero element in this ring has a multiplicative inverse. We have shown that every non-zero element in this ring has a multiplicative inverse, and therefore, $\\mathbb{Z}[i] /(q)$ is a field.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

This means that in the quotient ring, each of these products is \"collapsed\" to zero.\n\nNow, let's consider the prime ideals in this quotient ring. A prime ideal is an ideal such that if the product of two elements is in the ideal, then at least one of the elements must be in the ideal. We want to show that there are infinitely many minimal prime ideals.\n\nTo do this, we'll construct an infinite sequence of minimal prime ideals. For each positive integer $n$, consider the ideal $P_{n}$ generated by $x_{1} x_{2} \\cdots x_{2n}$. This ideal is prime because if the product of two elements is in $P_{n}$, then at least one of the elements must contain a factor of $x_{1} x_{2} \\cdots x_{2n}$.\n\nNow, we claim that each $P_{n}$ is a minimal prime ideal. To see this, suppose that $Q$ is a prime ideal contained in $P_{n}$. If $Q$ contains any of the generators of $P_{n}$, then it must contain all of them, because they are all multiples of each other. Therefore, $Q = P_{n}$, and $P_{n}$ is minimal.\n\nWe've constructed an infinite sequence of minimal prime ideals, $P_{1}, P_{2}, P_{3}, \\ldots$. To show that there are infinitely many of them, we'll show that they are all distinct. Suppose that $P_{m} = P_{n}$ for some $m \\neq n$. Then the generators of $P_{m}$ and $P_{n}$ must be equal, which is impossible because they are all multiples of each other. Therefore, the $P_{n}$ are all distinct, and there are infinitely many of them.\n\nThis completes the proof that the ring $\\mathbb{Z}\\left[x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}, \\ldots\\right] /\\left(x_{1} x_{2}, x_{3} x_{4}, x_{5} x_{6}, \\ldots\\right)$ contains infinitely many minimal prime ideals.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'let'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'let'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'let'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

Since the degree of the polynomial is 4, we can have at most two non-constant factors. \n\nWe can start by trying to factor the polynomial as a difference of squares. However, we notice that the constant term is 6, which is not a perfect square. Therefore, we cannot factor the polynomial as a difference of squares.\n\nNext, we can try to factor the polynomial as a product of two quadratic polynomials. Let's assume that the polynomial can be factored as $(x^2+ax+b)(x^2+cx+d)$, where $a, b, c,$ and $d$ are integers.\n\nExpanding the product, we get $x^4+(a+c)x^3+(ac+b+d)x^2+(bc+ad)x+bd$. Comparing the coefficients of this expression with the original polynomial, we get the following system of equations:\n\n$a+c=-4$\n$ac+b+d=0$\n$bc+ad=0$\n$bd=6$\n\nNow, let's analyze the last equation. Since $bd=6$, we know that either $b$ or $d$ must be a factor of 6. However, if $b$ is a factor of 6, then $d$ must be a multiple of 6, and vice versa. But then, the second equation $ac+b+d=0$ would imply that $ac$ is a multiple of 6, which is not possible since $a$ and $c$ are integers.\n\nTherefore, we have reached a contradiction, and our assumption that the polynomial can be factored as a product of two quadratic polynomials must be false.\n\nSince we have exhausted all possible factorizations, we conclude that $x^4-4x^3+6$ is irreducible in $\\mathbb{Z}[x]$.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'EisensteinCriterion.irreducible'\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'EisensteinCriterion.irreducible'\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: expected token\nPlease revise the proof.",

This is because the binomial expansion of $(x+1)^4$ is $x^4+4x^3+6x^2+4x+1$. Although this expansion is not exactly the same as the given polynomial, we can see that the difference between the two is just a constant term, which is $1$ in the given polynomial and $1$ in the expansion of $(x+1)^4$. \n\nSince $1$ is a unit in $\\mathbb{Z}[x]$, we can multiply the expansion of $(x+1)^4$ by $1$ to get the given polynomial. This means that the given polynomial is a multiple of the irreducible polynomial $(x+1)^4$, and therefore, it is also irreducible in $\\mathbb{Z}[x]$.\n\nHowever, we can also see that the given polynomial can be factored as $(x+1)^2(x^2+2x+1)$. Since the quadratic polynomial $x^2+2x+1$ has no real roots, it cannot be factored further into linear factors with integer coefficients. Therefore, the given polynomial is irreducible in $\\mathbb{Z}[x]$.\n\nAlternatively, we can also use the fact that the given polynomial is a perfect square, since it can be written as $(x+1)^4$.

This means that the product of the constant terms of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ must be equal to $-\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nNow, we have a problem. The product of the leading coefficients of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ is a non-zero element of $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{2}]$, but the product of the constant terms of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ is $-\\sqrt{2}$.

In this case, $\\mathbb{R}^1$ is simply $\\mathbb{R}$ itself, so the statement is trivially true.\n\nNow, let's consider the case when $n > 1$. We can define a linear transformation $T: \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}$ by mapping each vector $(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n) \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ to the real number $x_1 + x_2 + \\cdots + x_n$. This transformation is clearly linear, as it preserves the operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication.\n\nTo show that $T$ is bijective, we need to show that it is both injective and surjective.\n\nFirst, let's show that $T$ is injective. Suppose that $T((x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n)) = T((y_1, y_2, \\ldots, y_n))$. This means that $x_1 + x_2 + \\cdots + x_n = y_1 + y_2 + \\cdots + y_n$.

Let $\\mathcal{T}_1 = \\{\\emptyset, X\\}$ and $\\mathcal{T}_2 = \\{\\emptyset, \\{a\\}, X\\}$. Both of these are valid topologies on $X$.\n\nNow, let's consider the union of these two topologies, denoted as $\\bigcup \\mathcal{T}_1, \\mathcal{T}_2$. This union would include all the elements from both $\\mathcal{T}_1$ and $\\mathcal{T}_2$, which are $\\{\\emptyset, X\\}$ and $\\{\\emptyset, \\{a\\}, X\\}$ respectively.\n\nCombining these two sets, we get $\\bigcup \\mathcal{T}_1, \\mathcal{T}_2 = \\{\\emptyset, \\{a\\}, X\\}$. However, this union does not satisfy one of the key properties of a topology: it is not closed under finite intersections.\n\nFor example, consider the intersection of $\\{a\\}$ and $X$. In $\\mathcal{T}_1$, the intersection of $\\{a\\}$ and $X$ is $\\{a\\}$, which is in $\\mathcal{T}_1$. However, in $\\bigcup \\mathcal{T}_1, \\mathcal{T}_2$, the intersection of $\\{a\\}$ and $X$ is also $\\{a\\}$, but $\\{a\\}$ is not in $\\mathcal{T}_1$. This shows that $\\bigcup \\mathcal{T}_1, \\mathcal{T}_2$ is not closed under finite intersections, and therefore it is not a valid topology on $X$.\n\nThis example demonstrates that the union of a family of topologies on a set $X$ does not necessarily form a topology.\nPrevious attempt failed with: type mismatch\n  \u2115\nhas type\n  Type : Type 1\nbut is expected to have type\n  Type u_1 : Type (u_1 + 1)\ntype mismatch\n  \u2115\nhas type\n  Type : Type 1\nbut is expected to have type\n  Type u_2 : Type (u_2 + 1)\ntactic 'split_ifs' failed, no if-then-else conditions to split\ncase h.left\ni : sorryAx (Type u_2) true\n\u22a2 is_topology (sorryAx (Type u_1) true) (sorryAx (Set (Set (sorryAx (Type u_1) true))) true)\nunsolved goals\nh : is_topology (sorryAx (Type u_1) true) (\u22c2 i, sorryAx (Set (Set (sorryAx (Type u_1) true))) true)\n\u22a2 \u2200 (i : \u2115), \u2205 \u2208 if i = 0 then {\u2205, univ} else {\u2205, {0}}\nunsolved goals\nh : is_topology (sorryAx (Type u_1) true) (\u22c2 i, sorryAx (Set (Set (sorryAx (Type u_1) true))) true)\nh1 : \u2205 \u2208 \u22c2 i, if i = 0 then {\u2205, univ} else {\u2205, {0}}\n\u22a2 \u2200 (i : \u2115), univ \u2208 if i = 0 then {\u2205, univ} else {\u2205, {0}}\nfailed to synthesize\n  Singleton ?m.14474 (Sort ?u.14302)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  Insert ?m.14327 (Sort ?u.14302)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  Singleton ?m.15147 (Sort ?u.14975)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  Insert ?m.15000 (Sort ?u.14975)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: type mismatch\n  \u2115\nhas type\n  Type : Type 1\nbut is expected to have type\n  Type u_1 : Type (u_1 + 1)\ntype mismatch\n  \u2115\nhas type\n  Type : Type 1\nbut is expected to have type\n  Type u_2 : Type (u_2 + 1)\ntactic 'split_ifs' failed, no if-then-else conditions to split\ncase h.left\ni : sorryAx (Type u_2) true\n\u22a2 is_topology (sorryAx (Type u_1) true) (sorryAx (Set (Set (sorryAx (Type u_1) true))) true)\nunsolved goals\nh : is_topology (sorryAx (Type u_1) true) (\u22c2 i, sorryAx (Set (Set (sorryAx (Type u_1) true))) true)\n\u22a2 \u2200 (i : \u2115), \u2205 \u2208 if i = 0 then {\u2205, univ} else {\u2205, {0}}\nunsolved goals\nh : is_topology (sorryAx (Type u_1) true) (\u22c2 i, sorryAx (Set (Set (sorryAx (Type u_1) true))) true)\nh1 : \u2205 \u2208 \u22c2 i, if i = 0 then {\u2205, univ} else {\u2205, {0}}\n\u22a2 \u2200 (i : \u2115), univ \u2208 if i = 0 then {\u2205, univ} else {\u2205, {0}}\nfailed to synthesize\n  Singleton ?m.14474 (Sort ?u.14302)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  Insert ?m.14327 (Sort ?u.14302)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  Singleton ?m.15147 (Sort ?u.14975)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  Insert ?m.15000 (Sort ?u.14975)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: type mismatch\n  \u2115\nhas type\n  Type : Type 1\nbut is expected to have type\n  Type u_1 : Type (u_1 + 1)\ntype mismatch\n  \u2115\nhas type\n  Type : Type 1\nbut is expected to have type\n  Type u_2 : Type (u_2 + 1)\ntactic 'split_ifs' failed, no if-then-else conditions to split\ncase h.left\ni : sorryAx (Type u_2) true\n\u22a2 is_topology (sorryAx (Type u_1) true) (sorryAx (Set (Set (sorryAx (Type u_1) true))) true)\nunsolved goals\nh : is_topology (sorryAx (Type u_1) true) (\u22c2 i, sorryAx (Set (Set (sorryAx (Type u_1) true))) true)\n\u22a2 \u2200 (i : \u2115), \u2205 \u2208 if i = 0 then {\u2205, univ} else {\u2205, {0}}\nunsolved goals\nh : is_topology (sorryAx (Type u_1) true) (\u22c2 i, sorryAx (Set (Set (sorryAx (Type u_1) true))) true)\nh1 : \u2205 \u2208 \u22c2 i, if i = 0 then {\u2205, univ} else {\u2205, {0}}\n\u22a2 \u2200 (i : \u2115), univ \u2208 if i = 0 then {\u2205, univ} else {\u2205, {0}}\nfailed to synthesize\n  Singleton ?m.14474 (Sort ?u.14302)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  Insert ?m.14327 (Sort ?u.14302)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  Singleton ?m.15147 (Sort ?u.14975)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  Insert ?m.15000 (Sort ?u.14975)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nPlease revise the proof.",

We're given a subbasis $\\mathcal{A}$ for a topology on a set $X$, and we want to show that the topology generated by $\\mathcal{A}$ is equal to the intersection of all topologies on $X$ that contain $\\mathcal{A}$.\n\nFirst, let's recall what a subbasis is. A subbasis for a topology on $X$ is a collection of subsets of $X$ such that the topology generated by the subbasis is the smallest topology containing all the subsets in the subbasis.\n\nNow, let's consider the topology generated by $\\mathcal{A}$. This topology, which we'll call $\\mathcal{T}_\\mathcal{A}$, is the smallest topology that contains all the subsets in $\\mathcal{A}$.

We want to show that $(x, y)$ can be expressed as a finite intersection of sets from the collection. \n\nSince $x$ and $y$ are real numbers, we can find rational numbers $a_n$ and $b_n$ such that $a_n < x < b_n$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, and similarly, rational numbers $c_n$ and $d_n$ such that $c_n < y < d_n$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$. \n\nNow, consider the sets $S_n = (a_n, b_n) \\times (c_n, d_n)$ from the given collection. Since $a_n < x < b_n$ and $c_n < y < d_n$, we have $(x, y) \\in S_n$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$. \n\nMoreover, since $x$ and $y$ are real numbers, there exists some $N \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that $a_N < x < b_N$ and $c_N < y < d_N$ are arbitrarily close to $x$ and $y$, respectively. This means that the intervals $(a_N, b_N)$ and $(c_N, d_N)$ are arbitrarily close to $x$ and $y$, respectively.\n\nNow, consider the set $S = (a_N, b_N) \\times (c_N, d_N)$. Since $S$ is a finite intersection of sets from the collection, we have $S \\in \\mathcal{C}$, where $\\mathcal{C}$ is the given countable collection. \n\nMoreover, since $(x, y) \\in S$ and $S$ is arbitrarily close to $(x, y)$, we have $(x, y) \\in \\overline{S}$, where $\\overline{S}$ is the closure of $S$. \n\nSince $\\overline{S}$ is a closed set containing $(x, y)$, we have $(x, y) \\in \\overline{S} \\subseteq \\bigcap_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} S_n$. \n\nThis shows that every point in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ can be expressed as a finite intersection of sets from the collection.\n\nNext, we need to show that the collection is closed under finite intersections. \n\nLet $S_1, S_2, \\ldots, S_k$ be sets from the collection, where each $S_i = (a_i, b_i) \\times (c_i, d_i)$ for some rational numbers $a_i, b_i, c_i, d_i$. \n\nWe want to show that $\\bigcap_{i=1}^k S_i$ is also a set from the collection. \n\nSince each $S_i$ is a set from the collection, we have $a_i < b_i$ and $c_i < d_i$ for all $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, k\\}$. \n\nNow, consider the set $T = \\bigcap_{i=1}^k S_i$. \n\nWe claim that $T$ is a set from the collection. \n\nTo see this, let $(x, y) \\in T$. \n\nThen, for each $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, k\\}$, we have $(x, y) \\in S_i$, which means that $a_i < x < b_i$ and $c_i < y < d_i$. \n\nThis shows that $T$ is a set from the collection.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that the given countable collection is a basis for $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unexpected token ','; expected '\u21a6', '=>'\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unexpected token ','; expected '\u21a6', '=>'\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unexpected token ','; expected '\u21a6', '=>'\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

Let's denote the complement of this set as $A = \\{x \\mid f(x) > g(x)\\}$.\n\nConsider any point $x_0 \\in A$. Since $f$ and $g$ are continuous functions, the preimage of any open set in $Y$ is open in $X$. We can use this property to our advantage.\n\nFor any $y \\in Y$ such that $g(x_0) < y < f(x_0)$, the set $V = (g(x_0), y)$ is an open interval in $Y$.

This means that for any point $x \\in A$, we have $g_1(x) = f(x) = g_2(x)$.\n\nNow, let's consider a point $x \\in \\bar{A}$.

For any two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ in $\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}$, we say that $(x_1, y_1) \\leq (x_2, y_2)$ if either $x_1 < x_2$ or $x_1 = x_2$ and $y_1 \\leq y_2$. This order is used to define the dictionary order topology on $\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nNow, let's consider the following function:\n\n$d((x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2)) = |x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|$\n\nThis function is a metric because it satisfies the three properties of a metric:\n\n1. Non-negativity: $d((x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2)) \\geq 0$ for all $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ in $\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}$.\n2. Identity of indiscernibles: $d((x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2)) = 0$ if and only if $(x_1, y_1) = (x_2, y_2)$.\n3. Symmetry: $d((x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2)) = d((x_2, y_2), (x_1, y_1))$ for all $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ in $\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nNow, let's show that the metric $d$ induces the same topology as the dictionary order. To do this, we need to show that every open set in the dictionary order topology is also open in the metric topology, and vice versa.\n\nLet $U$ be an open set in the dictionary order topology. We need to show that $U$ is also open in the metric topology. Let $(x, y)$ be a point in $U$. Since $U$ is open in the dictionary order, there exists an open interval $(a, b)$ in the dictionary order such that $(x, y) \\in (a, b) \\subseteq U$. We can write $(a, b)$ as the union of two open intervals $(a, c)$ and $(c, b)$, where $c$ is the least upper bound of $a$ and $b$ in the dictionary order.\n\nNow, let's consider the open balls $B_d((x, y), \\epsilon)$ in the metric topology. We need to show that there exists an $\\epsilon > 0$ such that $B_d((x, y), \\epsilon) \\subseteq U$. Let $\\epsilon = \\min\\{|x - a|, |y - c|\\}$. Then, for any point $(x', y')$ in $B_d((x, y), \\epsilon)$, we have $|x' - x| < \\epsilon$ and $|y' - y| < \\epsilon$. This implies that $x' \\in (a, c)$ and $y' \\in (c, b)$, so $(x', y') \\in (a, b) \\subseteq U$. Therefore, $B_d((x, y), \\epsilon) \\subseteq U$, and $U$ is open in the metric topology.\n\nConversely, let $V$ be an open set in the metric topology. We need to show that $V$ is also open in the dictionary order topology. Let $(x, y)$ be a point in $V$. Since $V$ is open in the metric topology, there exists an $\\epsilon > 0$ such that $B_d((x, y), \\epsilon) \\subseteq V$. We need to show that there exists an open interval $(a, b)$ in the dictionary order such that $(x, y) \\in (a, b) \\subseteq V$.\n\nLet $a = x - \\epsilon$ and $b = x + \\epsilon$. Then, $(a, b)$ is an open interval in the dictionary order, and $(x, y) \\in (a, b)$. We need to show that $(a, b) \\subseteq V$. Let $(x', y')$ be a point in $(a, b)$. Then, $x' \\in (a, b)$ and $y' \\in (c, b)$, where $c$ is the least upper bound of $a$ and $b$ in the dictionary order. We have $|x' - x| < \\epsilon$ and $|y' - y| < \\epsilon$, so $(x', y') \\in B_d((x, y), \\epsilon) \\subseteq V$. Therefore, $(a, b) \\subseteq V$, and $V$ is open in the dictionary order topology.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that every open set in the dictionary order topology is also open in the metric topology, and vice versa.

We can see that as $n$ increases, the function $f_{n}(x)$ becomes more and more sensitive to the value of $x$ near $x = 0$. In particular, for any fixed $x \\in (0,1)$, as $n$ increases, $f_{n}(x)$ approaches $0$ much faster than $f_{N}(x)$ does for any fixed $N$.\n\nTo make this more precise, let's consider a specific value of $x$, say $x = \\frac{1}{2}$. Then, for any $n \\geq 1$, we have $f_{n}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{n}$. Now, let's choose a specific value of $\\epsilon$, say $\\epsilon = \\frac{1}{2}$.

We can see that this difference is maximized when $n$ is as large as possible, so let's choose $n = N + 1$. Then, we have $\\left|f_{n}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) - f_{N}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\right| = \\left|\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{N+1} - \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{N}\\right| = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{N}\\left|\\frac{1}{2} - 1\\right| = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{N}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2^{N+1}}$.\n\nNow, we can see that $\\frac{1}{2^{N+1}} \\geq \\frac{1}{2}$ if and only if $N+1 \\leq 2$, which is true for all $N \\in \\mathbb{N}$.

This means that $p(A) = Y$ and $p(B) = \\emptyset$.\n\nSince $p(A) = Y$, we have that $p^{-1}(Y) = p^{-1}(p(A)) = A$.

This function is continuous because it's the difference of two continuous functions, $f(x)$ and $x$. \n\nNow, let's evaluate $g(x)$ at the endpoints of the interval $[0, 1]$. At $x = 0$, we have $g(0) = f(0) - 0 = f(0)$. Since $f$ is continuous, $f(0)$ is a real number, and we can assume it's either positive or negative. \n\nSimilarly, at $x = 1$, we have $g(1) = f(1) - 1$. Again, since $f$ is continuous, $f(1)$ is a real number, and we can assume it's either positive or negative.\n\nNow, let's consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: If $g(0) < 0$ and $g(1) > 0$, then by the IVT, there exists a point $x$ in the interval $[0, 1]$ such that $g(x) = 0$. This means that $f(x) - x = 0$, or $f(x) = x$. \n\nCase 2: If $g(0) > 0$ and $g(1) < 0$, then again by the IVT, there exists a point $x$ in the interval $[0, 1]$ such that $g(x) = 0$. This means that $f(x) - x = 0$, or $f(x) = x$. \n\nIn both cases, we've shown that there exists a point $x$ in the interval $[0, 1]$ such that $f(x) = x$. This point $x$ is called a fixed point of the function $f$. \n\nTherefore, we've proven that if $f$ is a continuous function from the interval $[0, 1]$ to itself, then there exists a point $x$ in the interval $[0, 1]$ such that $f(x) = x$.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'let'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'let'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'let'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

Suppose we have two elements $a, b \\in C$. Since $C$ is a connected subset of $G$, the continuous map $G \\times G \\to G$ given by $(x, y) \\mapsto xy$ must map the connected set $C \\times C$ to a connected subset of $G$. But $C \\times C$ is connected because it is the product of two connected sets, and the image of a connected set under a continuous map is connected. Therefore, the image of $C \\times C$ under the group operation is connected, and since $e \\in C$, the image must be contained in $C$. This shows that $ab \\in C$ for all $a, b \\in C$, so $C$ is closed under the group operation.\n\nNext, let's consider the closure of $C$ under inversion. Suppose we have an element $a \\in C$. Since the inversion map $G \\to G$ given by $x \\mapsto x^{-1}$ is continuous, the image of the connected set $C$ under this map must be connected. But the image of $C$ under the inversion map is the set of inverses of elements in $C$, which is precisely the set of elements in $C$ since $C$ contains the identity element $e$. Therefore, the image of $C$ under the inversion map is connected, and since $e \\in C$, the image must be contained in $C$. This shows that $a^{-1} \\in C$ for all $a \\in C$, so $C$ is closed under inversion.\n\nNow, let's show that $C$ is a normal subgroup of $G$. Suppose we have an element $g \\in G$ and an element $a \\in C$. We need to show that $gag^{-1} \\in C$. Since the conjugation map $G \\to G$ given by $x \\mapsto gxg^{-1}$ is continuous, the image of the connected set $C$ under this map must be connected. But the image of $C$ under the conjugation map is the set of elements of the form $gag^{-1}$ for $a \\in C$, which is precisely the set of elements in $C$ since $C$ contains the identity element $e$. Therefore, the image of $C$ under the conjugation map is connected, and since $e \\in C$, the image must be contained in $C$. This shows that $gag^{-1} \\in C$ for all $g \\in G$ and $a \\in C$, so $C$ is a normal subgroup of $G$.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that the component $C$ of the topological group $G$ containing the identity element $e$ is a normal subgroup of $G$.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'is_normal_subgroup_of_connected_component'\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'is_normal_subgroup_of_connected_component'\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'isNormalSubgroup_of_connected_component'\nPlease revise the proof.",

We want to show that $x = y$. Since $f$ is an isometry, we have $d(f(x), f(y)) = d(x, y)$. But we also have $d(f(x), f(y)) = 0$ since $f(x) = f(y)$. Therefore, $d(x, y) = 0$, which implies that $x = y$ by the definition of a metric. Hence, $f$ is injective.\n\n## Step 2: $f$ is surjective\n\nSince $X$ is compact, we can use the fact that a continuous function from a compact space to a Hausdorff space is a closed map. In this case, $f$ is continuous since it's an isometry, and $X$ is a Hausdorff space since it's a metric space. Therefore, $f$ is a closed map.\n\nNow, let $y \\in X$ be arbitrary. We want to show that there exists $x \\in X$ such that $f(x) = y$. Since $f$ is a closed map, the image of $X$ under $f$ is a closed subset of $X$. But $X$ is compact, so the image of $X$ under $f$ is also compact. Therefore, the image of $X$ under $f$ is a compact subset of $X$.\n\nSince $X$ is a metric space, it's a Hausdorff space, and therefore, it has the property that any compact subset is closed. Hence, the image of $X$ under $f$ is a closed subset of $X$.\n\nNow, let $C$ be the image of $X$ under $f$. Since $C$ is a closed subset of $X$, we can use the fact that $X$ is compact to find a point $x \\in X$ such that $f(x) = y$. Specifically, we can use the fact that $C$ is a closed subset of $X$ to find a point $x \\in X$ such that $f(x) = y$.\n\n## Step 3: $f$ is bijective and hence a homeomorphism\n\nWe've already shown that $f$ is injective in Step 1. In Step 2, we showed that $f$ is surjective. Therefore, $f$ is bijective.\n\nSince $f$ is bijective, it's a homeomorphism. Specifically, we can use the fact that $f$ is a bijective continuous function to show that $f$ is a homeomorphism.\n\nIn conclusion, we've shown that if $f$ is an isometry of a compact metric space $X$, then $f$ is bijective and hence a homeomorphism.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

A Hausdorff space is a topological space where any two distinct points can be separated by disjoint open sets. A locally compact space is one where every point has a compact neighborhood. Completely regular spaces are those where for any point and any closed set not containing that point, there exists a continuous function from the space to the real numbers that takes the point to 0 and the closed set to 1.\n\nLet's consider a locally compact Hausdorff space X and a point x in X. We want to show that for any closed set F in X that does not contain x, there exists a continuous function f from X to the real numbers such that f(x) = 0 and f(F) = {1}.\n\nSince X is locally compact, there exists a compact neighborhood U of x. Because X is Hausdorff, we can find an open set V such that x is in V and F is disjoint from V. Since U is compact and V is open, U \u2229 V is compact and non-empty.\n\nNow, we can use U \u2229 V to construct a continuous function f from X to the real numbers. We'll define f on U \u2229 V by setting f(y) = 1/d(y,F) for all y in U \u2229 V, where d(y,F) is the distance from y to F. This function is continuous because it's the reciprocal of a continuous function (the distance function).\n\nWe can extend f to the rest of X by setting f(y) = 0 for all y not in U \u2229 V. This function is continuous because U \u2229 V is compact and f is continuous on U \u2229 V.\n\nNow, we have a continuous function f from X to the real numbers such that f(x) = 0 and f(F) = {1}.

We can define a metric $d$ on $X_1 \\cup X_2$ as follows: for any two points $x, y \\in X_1 \\cup X_2$, if both $x$ and $y$ belong to either $X_1$ or $X_2$, then we define $d(x, y) = \\min\\{d_1(x, y), d_2(x, y)\\}$ if $x, y \\in X_1$ or $x, y \\in X_2$, and $d(x, y) = 1$ if $x \\in X_1$ and $y \\in X_2$ (or vice versa). This metric $d$ is well-defined because $X_1$ and $X_2$ are disjoint.\n\nThe metric $d$ induces a topology on $X_1 \\cup X_2$, which we claim coincides with the subspace topology on $X_1 \\cup X_2$ inherited from the topology on $X$. To see this, let $U$ be an open set in the subspace topology on $X_1 \\cup X_2$. Then $U = V \\cap (X_1 \\cup X_2)$ for some open set $V$ in $X$. Since $X$ is compact Hausdorff, $V$ is compact. By the definition of the subspace topology, $V \\cap X_1$ and $V \\cap X_2$ are open in $X_1$ and $X_2$ respectively. Since $X_1$ and $X_2$ are metrizable, there exist open balls $B_1(x_1, r_1)$ and $B_2(x_2, r_2)$ in $X_1$ and $X_2$ respectively, such that $B_1(x_1, r_1) \\subseteq V \\cap X_1$ and $B_2(x_2, r_2) \\subseteq V \\cap X_2$.

This shows that $U$ is open in the topology induced by the metric $d$.\n\nConversely, let $W$ be an open set in the topology induced by the metric $d$. Then for any $x \\in W$, there exists an open ball $B(x, r)$ in $X_1 \\cup X_2$ centered at $x$ and contained in $W$. If $x \\in X_1$, then $B(x, r) \\cap X_2 = \\emptyset$, so $B(x, r) \\subseteq W \\cap X_1$. Similarly, if $x \\in X_2$, then $B(x, r) \\cap X_1 = \\emptyset$, so $B(x, r) \\subseteq W \\cap X_2$.

If $x \\in X_1$ and $y \\in X_2$ (or vice versa), then we define $d'(x, y) = 1$. This metric $d'$ is well-defined because $X_1$ and $X_2$ are disjoint.\n\nThe metric $d'$ induces a topology on $X$, which we claim coincides with the original topology on $X$. To see this, let $U$ be an open set in the original topology on $X$. Then $U = V \\cap X$ for some open set $V$ in the topology induced by the metric $d'$. Since $V$ is open in the topology induced by the metric $d'$, there exists an open ball $B(x, r)$ in $X_1 \\cup X_2$ centered at $x$ and contained in $V$. If $x \\in X_1$, then $B(x, r) \\subseteq V \\cap X_1$, so $V \\cap X_1$ is open in the subspace topology on $X_1$. Similarly, if $x \\in X_2$, then $B(x, r) \\subseteq V \\cap X_2$, so $V \\cap X_2$ is open in the subspace topology on $X_2$. This shows that $V$ is open in the original topology on $X$.\n\nConversely, let $W$ be an open set in the original topology on $X$. Then for any $x \\in W$, there exists an open ball $B(x, r)$ in $X$ centered at $x$ and contained in $W$. If $x \\in X_1$, then $B(x, r) \\cap X_2 = \\emptyset$, so $B(x, r) \\subseteq W \\cap X_1$.

Our goal is to show that $f$ can be uniquely extended to a continuous function $g \\colon \\bar{A} \\rightarrow Y$, and that this extension $g$ is also uniformly continuous.\n\nFirst, let's consider the extension of $f$ to $\\bar{A}$. Since $f$ is uniformly continuous on $A$, for any $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists a $\\delta > 0$ such that for all $x, y \\in A$, if $d_X(x, y) < \\delta$, then $d_Y(f(x), f(y)) < \\epsilon$. This means that $f$ is continuous at every point in $A$.\n\nNow, let's consider a point $x \\in \\bar{A}$. If $x \\in A$, then we can simply define $g(x) = f(x)$. However, if $x \\notin A$, then $x$ is a limit point of $A$. In this case, we can use the uniform continuity of $f$ to define $g(x)$.\n\nFor any sequence $\\{x_n\\}$ in $A$ that converges to $x$, we have that $f(x_n)$ converges to $f(x)$ in $Y$. Since $Y$ is complete, this sequence $\\{f(x_n)\\}$ converges to some point $y \\in Y$. We can then define $g(x) = y$.\n\nTo show that this definition is well-defined, we need to show that the value of $g(x)$ does not depend on the choice of the sequence $\\{x_n\\}$. Suppose that $\\{x_n\\}$ and $\\{x_n'\\}$ are two sequences in $A$ that converge to $x$. Then, for any $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists a $\\delta > 0$ such that if $d_X(x_n, x_n') < \\delta$, then $d_Y(f(x_n), f(x_n')) < \\epsilon$. Since both sequences converge to $x$, there exists an $N$ such that for all $n > N$, $d_X(x_n, x_n') < \\delta$. This means that the sequences $\\{f(x_n)\\}$ and $\\{f(x_n')\\}$ are Cauchy sequences in $Y$, and since $Y$ is complete, they converge to the same point $y \\in Y$. Therefore, the value of $g(x)$ is well-defined.\n\nNow, let's show that $g$ is continuous. Suppose that $x \\in \\bar{A}$ and $\\epsilon > 0$. If $x \\in A$, then since $f$ is uniformly continuous, there exists a $\\delta > 0$ such that if $d_X(x, y) < \\delta$, then $d_Y(f(x), f(y)) < \\epsilon$. This means that $g$ is continuous at $x$. If $x \\notin A$, then $x$ is a limit point of $A$. In this case, we can use the uniform continuity of $f$ to show that $g$ is continuous at $x$.\n\nFor any sequence $\\{x_n\\}$ in $A$ that converges to $x$, we have that $f(x_n)$ converges to $g(x)$ in $Y$. Suppose that $\\{y_n\\}$ is a sequence in $\\bar{A}$ that converges to $x$. Then, for any $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists a $\\delta > 0$ such that if $d_X(x_n, y_n) < \\delta$, then $d_Y(f(x_n), f(y_n)) < \\epsilon$. Since both sequences converge to $x$, there exists an $N$ such that for all $n > N$, $d_X(x_n, y_n) < \\delta$. This means that the sequences $\\{f(x_n)\\}$ and $\\{f(y_n)\\}$ are Cauchy sequences in $Y$, and since $Y$ is complete, they converge to the same point $y \\in Y$. Therefore, $g$ is continuous at $x$.\n\nFinally, let's show that $g$ is uniformly continuous. Suppose that $\\epsilon > 0$. Since $f$ is uniformly continuous on $A$, there exists a $\\delta > 0$ such that if $x, y \\in A$ and $d_X(x, y) < \\delta$, then $d_Y(f(x), f(y)) < \\epsilon$. This means that $g$ is uniformly continuous on $A$. Now, suppose that $x, y \\in \\bar{A}$ and $d_X(x, y) < \\delta$. If $x, y \\in A$, then since $f$ is uniformly continuous, we have that $d_Y(g(x), g(y)) < \\epsilon$. If $x \\notin A$ and $y \\notin A$, then since $x$ and $y$ are limit points of $A$, there exist sequences $\\{x_n\\}$ and $\\{y_n\\}$ in $A$ that converge to $x$ and $y$, respectively. Then, since $g$ is continuous, we have that $g(x_n)$ converges to $g(x)$ and $g(y_n)$ converges to $g(y)$. Since $f$ is uniformly continuous, we have that $d_Y(f(x_n), f(y_n)) < \\epsilon$ for all $n$. Therefore, since $d_X(x_n, y_n) < \\delta$ for all $n$, we have that $d_Y(g(x_n), g(y_n)) < \\epsilon$ for all $n$. This means that the sequences $\\{g(x_n)\\}$ and $\\{g(y_n)\\}$ are Cauchy sequences in $Y$, and since $Y$ is complete, they converge to the same point $z \\in Y$. Therefore, $d_Y(g(x), g(y)) \\leq \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} d_Y(g(x_n), g(y_n)) < \\epsilon$. This means that $g$ is uniformly continuous.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that $f$ can be uniquely extended to a continuous function $g \\colon \\bar{A} \\rightarrow Y$, and that this extension $g$ is uniformly continuous.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'let'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'let'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'let'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

When we add these fractions together, we are essentially adding a series of positive, non-integer values.\n\nNow, let's assume that the sum $\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{3}+\\cdots+\\frac{1}{n}$ is an integer. This means that the sum can be expressed as a whole number, say $m$, where $m$ is a positive integer.\n\nHowever, if we multiply both sides of the equation by the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators of the fractions, we will obtain an equation of the form:\n\n$\\frac{2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 \\cdots n}{2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 \\cdots n} = m$\n\nSimplifying the left-hand side, we get:\n\n$2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 \\cdots n = m \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 \\cdots n$\n\nThis implies that $m \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 \\cdots n = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 \\cdots n$, which means that $m$ must be equal to 1.\n\nBut this is a contradiction, since we assumed that $m$ is a positive integer greater than 1.

Now, let's examine the expression $a^{2^{n}}+1$.\n\nWhen we substitute $a=2k+1$ into the expression, we get $(2k+1)^{2^{n}}+1$. Expanding this using the binomial theorem, we see that the only even term in the expansion is the last term, which is $2^{2^{n}}k^{2^{n}}$. All other terms are odd.\n\nSince $a^{2^{n}}+1$ is the sum of an odd number and 1, it is even. Similarly, $a^{2^{m}}+1$ is also even.\n\nNow, let's consider the greatest common divisor (GCD) of $a^{2^{n}}+1$ and $a^{2^{m}}+1$. Since both numbers are even, their GCD must be at least 2.\n\nHowever, we can show that the GCD cannot be greater than 2. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that the GCD is greater than 2. Then, there exists a prime number $p>2$ that divides both $a^{2^{n}}+1$ and $a^{2^{m}}+1$.\n\nSince $p$ divides $a^{2^{n}}+1$, it must also divide $a^{2^{n}}$. Similarly, since $p$ divides $a^{2^{m}}+1$, it must also divide $a^{2^{m}}$.\n\nHowever, this leads to a contradiction. If $p$ divides both $a^{2^{n}}$ and $a^{2^{m}}$, then it must also divide their difference, which is $a^{2^{n}-2^{m}}(a^{2^{m}}-1)$. But this difference is odd, since $a^{2^{m}}-1$ is odd and $a^{2^{n}-2^{m}}$ is also odd.\n\nTherefore, our assumption that the GCD is greater than 2 must be false. This means that the GCD of $a^{2^{n}}+1$ and $a^{2^{m}}+1$ is exactly 2.\n\nNow, let's consider the case when $a$ is an even integer. We can express $a$ as $2k$ for some integer $k$. Then, $a^{2^{n}}+1$ and $a^{2^{m}}+1$ are both odd.\n\nIn this case, the GCD of $a^{2^{n}}+1$ and $a^{2^{m}}+1$ is 1, since they are relatively prime.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that if $a$ is a nonzero integer, then for $n>m$, the GCD of $a^{2^{n}}+1$ and $a^{2^{m}}+1$ is either 1 or 2, depending on whether $a$ is odd or even.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  ?i.gcd ?j\ncase left\na : \u2124\nha : a \u2260 0\nf_a : optParam (\u2115 \u2192 \u2115 \u2192 \u2115) fun n m => (a ^ 2 ^ n + 1).gcd (a ^ 2 ^ m + 1)\nn m : \u2115\nhnm : n > m\nh_odd : Odd a\n\u22a2 f_a n m = 1\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  ?i.gcd ?j\ncase right\na : \u2124\nha : a \u2260 0\nf_a : optParam (\u2115 \u2192 \u2115 \u2192 \u2115) fun n m => (a ^ 2 ^ n + 1).gcd (a ^ 2 ^ m + 1)\nn m : \u2115\nhnm : n > m\nh_even : Even a\n\u22a2 f_a n m = 2\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  ?i.gcd ?j\ncase left\na : \u2124\nha : a \u2260 0\nf_a : optParam (\u2115 \u2192 \u2115 \u2192 \u2115) fun n m => (a ^ 2 ^ n + 1).gcd (a ^ 2 ^ m + 1)\nn m : \u2115\nhnm : n > m\nh_odd : Odd a\n\u22a2 f_a n m = 1\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  ?i.gcd ?j\ncase right\na : \u2124\nha : a \u2260 0\nf_a : optParam (\u2115 \u2192 \u2115 \u2192 \u2115) fun n m => (a ^ 2 ^ n + 1).gcd (a ^ 2 ^ m + 1)\nn m : \u2115\nhnm : n > m\nh_even : Even a\n\u22a2 f_a n m = 2\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  ?i.gcd ?j\ncase left\na : \u2124\nha : a \u2260 0\nf_a : optParam (\u2115 \u2192 \u2115 \u2192 \u2115) fun n m => (a ^ 2 ^ n + 1).gcd (a ^ 2 ^ m + 1)\nn m : \u2115\nhnm : n > m\nh_odd : Odd a\n\u22a2 f_a n m = 1\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  ?i.gcd ?j\ncase right\na : \u2124\nha : a \u2260 0\nf_a : optParam (\u2115 \u2192 \u2115 \u2192 \u2115) fun n m => (a ^ 2 ^ n + 1).gcd (a ^ 2 ^ m + 1)\nn m : \u2115\nhnm : n > m\nh_even : Even a\n\u22a2 f_a n m = 2\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "# Informal Proof:\n\nTo show that the sum of the reciprocals of square-free integers diverges, we can start by understanding what square-free integers are. A square-free integer is an integer that is not divisible by the square of any prime number. In other words, it is an integer that is not a multiple of any perfect square.\n\nNow, let's consider the set of square-free integers. We can see that this set contains all prime numbers, as well as all composite numbers that are not multiples of any perfect square. For example, the set of square-free integers includes numbers like 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, as well as numbers like 6, 10, and 14.\n\nOne way to approach this problem is to compare the sum of the reciprocals of square-free integers to the sum of the reciprocals of all positive integers. We know that the sum of the reciprocals of all positive integers is the harmonic series, which is known to diverge.\n\nTo make a connection between the two sums, we can use the fact that every positive integer can be expressed as a product of prime powers. In other words, every positive integer can be written in the form $p_1^{a_1}p_2^{a_2}...p_k^{a_k}$, where $p_1, p_2, ..., p_k$ are distinct prime numbers and $a_1, a_2, ..., a_k$ are non-negative integers.\n\nNow, let's consider a positive integer $n$ that is not square-free. This means that $n$ is divisible by the square of some prime number $p$. We can write $n = p^2m$, where $m$ is an integer that is not divisible by $p$.\n\nWe can then express the reciprocal of $n$ as $\\frac{1}{n} = \\frac{1}{p^2m}$. Since $m$ is not divisible by $p$, we can write $m = p^bm'$, where $b$ is a non-negative integer and $m'$ is an integer that is not divisible by $p$.\n\nSubstituting this expression for $m$ into the reciprocal of $n$, we get $\\frac{1}{n} = \\frac{1}{p^2p^bm'} = \\frac{1}{p^{2+b}}\\frac{1}{m'}$.\n\nNow, let's consider the sum of the reciprocals of all positive integers. We can group the terms in this sum according to the power of the largest prime factor of each integer. For example, we can group the terms with the largest prime factor of 2, then the terms with the largest prime factor of 3, and so on.\n\nWhen we group the terms in this way, we can see that the sum of the reciprocals of all positive integers is at least as large as the sum of the reciprocals of the square-free integers. This is because each term in the sum of the reciprocals of the square-free integers is included in the sum of the reciprocals of all positive integers, and each term in the sum of the reciprocals of all positive integers is at least as large as the corresponding term in the sum of the reciprocals of the square-free integers.\n\nSince the sum of the reciprocals of all positive integers diverges, we can conclude that the sum of the reciprocals of the square-free integers also diverges.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that the sum of the reciprocals of square-free integers diverges.\nPrevious attempt failed with: function expected at\n  h\nterm has type\n  \u211a\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: invalid field notation, type is not of the form (C ...) where C is a constant\n  Summable\nhas type\n  (?m.5493 \u2192 ?m.5492) \u2192 Prop\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'summable_of_summable_norm'\nunknown identifier 'summable_of_summable_norm'\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "# Informal Proof:\n\nTo show that the equation $3x^{2}+2=y^{2}$ has no solution in integers, let's start by considering the properties of perfect squares.\n\nFirst, we note that the square of any integer is either even or odd. If $y$ is even, then $y^{2}$ is also even. However, $3x^{2}+2$ is always odd, since $3x^{2}$ is always even (because it's a multiple of 2) and adding 2 makes it odd. This means that if $y$ is even, then $3x^{2}+2$ cannot be equal to $y^{2}$.\n\nOn the other hand, if $y$ is odd, then $y^{2}$ is also odd. In this case, we can write $y$ as $2k+1$ for some integer $k$. Then, $y^{2}=(2k+1)^{2}=4k^{2}+4k+1$. Now, let's consider the equation $3x^{2}+2=y^{2}$ and substitute $y^{2}$ with $4k^{2}+4k+1$. We get:\n\n$3x^{2}+2=4k^{2}+4k+1$\n\nSubtracting 2 from both sides gives us:\n\n$3x^{2}=4k^{2}+4k-1$\n\nNow, let's examine the right-hand side of the equation. We can rewrite $4k^{2}+4k-1$ as $(2k-1)^{2}+2k$. Since $(2k-1)^{2}$ is always a perfect square, we can see that $4k^{2}+4k-1$ is always 2 more than a perfect square.\n\nHowever, $3x^{2}$ is always a multiple of 3. This means that $3x^{2}$ can never be 2 more than a perfect square, because a multiple of 3 cannot be 2 more than a perfect square (since the difference between consecutive perfect squares is always an odd number).\n\nTherefore, we have reached a contradiction, and we conclude that the equation $3x^{2}+2=y^{2}$ has no solution in integers.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown constant 'Int.mod_two_eq_zero_or_one'\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  x % 2\ncase inl\nx y : \u2124\nh\u271d : 3 * x ^ 2 + 2 = y ^ 2\nh : x % 2 = 0\n\u22a2 x ^ 2 % 2 = 0 \u2228 x ^ 2 % 2 = 1\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  x % 2\ncase inr\nx y : \u2124\nh\u271d : 3 * x ^ 2 + 2 = y ^ 2\nh : x % 2 = 1\n\u22a2 x ^ 2 % 2 = 0 \u2228 x ^ 2 % 2 = 1\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  x ^ 2 % 2\ncase inl\nx y : \u2124\nh\u271d : 3 * x ^ 2 + 2 = y ^ 2\nh : x ^ 2 % 2 = 0\n\u22a2 3 * x ^ 2 % 2 = 1\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  x ^ 2 % 2\ncase inr\nx y : \u2124\nh\u271d : 3 * x ^ 2 + 2 = y ^ 2\nh : x ^ 2 % 2 = 1\n\u22a2 3 * x ^ 2 % 2 = 1\nunknown constant 'Int.add_mod'\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, equality or iff proof expected\n  ?m.1902\nx y : \u2124\nh : 3 * x ^ 2 + 2 = y ^ 2\nthis : 3 * x ^ 2 % 2 = 1\n\u22a2 (3 * x ^ 2 + 2) % 2 = 1\nunknown constant 'Int.mod_two_eq_zero_or_one'\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  y % 2\ncase inl\nx y : \u2124\nh\u271d : 3 * x ^ 2 + 2 = y ^ 2\nh_parity : (3 * x ^ 2 + 2) % 2 = 1\nh : y % 2 = 0\n\u22a2 y ^ 2 % 2 = 0 \u2228 y ^ 2 % 2 = 1\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  y % 2\ncase inr\nx y : \u2124\nh\u271d : 3 * x ^ 2 + 2 = y ^ 2\nh_parity : (3 * x ^ 2 + 2) % 2 = 1\nh : y % 2 = 1\n\u22a2 y ^ 2 % 2 = 0 \u2228 y ^ 2 % 2 = 1\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  y ^ 2 % 2\ncase intro.intro.inl\nx y : \u2124\nh\u271d : 3 * x ^ 2 + 2 = y ^ 2\nh_parity : (3 * x ^ 2 + 2) % 2 = 1\nh : y ^ 2 % 2 = 0\n\u22a2 False\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  y ^ 2 % 2\ncase intro.intro.inr\nx y : \u2124\nh\u271d : 3 * x ^ 2 + 2 = y ^ 2\nh_parity : (3 * x ^ 2 + 2) % 2 = 1\nh : y ^ 2 % 2 = 1\n\u22a2 False\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown constant 'Int.add_mod'\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, equality or iff proof expected\n  ?m.963\nx y : \u2124\nh : 3 * x ^ 2 + 2 = y ^ 2\n\u22a2 (3 * x ^ 2 + 2) % 2 = 1\nunknown constant 'Int.mod_two_eq_zero_or_one'\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  y ^ 2 % 2\ncase intro.intro.inl\nx y : \u2124\nh : 3 * x ^ 2 + 2 = y ^ 2\nh_parity : (3 * x ^ 2 + 2) % 2 = 1\nh1 : y ^ 2 % 2 = 0\n\u22a2 False\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  y ^ 2 % 2\ncase intro.intro.inr\nx y : \u2124\nh : 3 * x ^ 2 + 2 = y ^ 2\nh_parity : (3 * x ^ 2 + 2) % 2 = 1\nh1 : y ^ 2 % 2 = 1\n\u22a2 False\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown constant 'Int.add_mod'\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, equality or iff proof expected\n  ?m.963\nx y : \u2124\nh : 3 * x ^ 2 + 2 = y ^ 2\n\u22a2 (3 * x ^ 2 + 2) % 2 = 1\nunknown constant 'Int.pow_mod'\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, equality or iff proof expected\n  ?m.1388\nx y : \u2124\nh : 3 * x ^ 2 + 2 = y ^ 2\nh_parity : (3 * x ^ 2 + 2) % 2 = 1\n\u22a2 y ^ 2 % 2 = 0 \u2228 y ^ 2 % 2 = 1\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  y ^ 2 % 2\ncase intro.intro.inl\nx y : \u2124\nh : 3 * x ^ 2 + 2 = y ^ 2\nh_parity : (3 * x ^ 2 + 2) % 2 = 1\nh_even : y ^ 2 % 2 = 0\n\u22a2 False\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  y ^ 2 % 2\ncase intro.intro.inr\nx y : \u2124\nh : 3 * x ^ 2 + 2 = y ^ 2\nh_parity : (3 * x ^ 2 + 2) % 2 = 1\nh_odd : y ^ 2 % 2 = 1\n\u22a2 False\nPlease revise the proof.",

A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or itself. In other words, it's a number that can be expressed as the product of two smaller positive integers.\n\nLet's assume $n$ is a composite number. Then, we can write $n = ab$, where $a$ and $b$ are positive integers greater than 1. Since $n$ is composite, both $a$ and $b$ are less than $n$.\n\nNow, let's consider the factorial $(n-1)!$. By definition, it's the product of all positive integers from 1 to $n-1$. Since $a$ and $b$ are both less than $n$, they are both included in the product $(n-1)!$.\n\nWe know that $n = ab$, so we can rewrite this as $ab = n$. Multiplying both sides by $(n-1)!$, we get $ab(n-1)! = n(n-1)!$. \n\nNow, since $a$ and $b$ are both factors of $(n-1)!$, we can rewrite the equation as $a \\cdot b \\cdot (n-1)! = n \\cdot (n-1)!$. \n\nNotice that the left-hand side of the equation is a multiple of $n$, since $ab$ is a factor of $n$.

This means that $k$ is not a multiple of $p-1$. We can use the fact that the powers of integers modulo $p$ repeat in a cycle of length $p-1$. This is known as Fermat's Little Theorem.\n\nSince $p-1 \\nmid k$, the powers of integers modulo $p$ will not repeat in a cycle of length $p-1$. However, we can still use the fact that the sum of the powers of integers modulo $p$ is congruent to $0$ modulo $p$.\n\nTo see this, consider the sum of the first $p-1$ powers of integers modulo $p$. We can pair up the terms as follows:\n\n$1^{k}+2^{k}+\\cdots+(p-1)^{k} = (1^{k}+(p-1)^{k}) + (2^{k}+(p-2)^{k}) + \\cdots + ((p-2)^{k}+2^{k}) + (p-1)^{k}+1^{k}$\n\nNow, notice that each pair of terms is congruent to $0$ modulo $p$. For example, $(1^{k}+(p-1)^{k}) \\equiv 0(p)$ because $1^{k} \\equiv 1(p)$ and $(p-1)^{k} \\equiv -1(p)$.\n\nSince each pair of terms is congruent to $0$ modulo $p$, the entire sum is congruent to $0$ modulo $p$. Therefore, we have:\n\n$1^{k}+2^{k}+\\cdots+(p-1)^{k} \\equiv 0(p)$\n\nNow, let's consider the case when $p-1 \\mid k$. This means that $k$ is a multiple of $p-1$. In this case, we can use the fact that the powers of integers modulo $p$ repeat in a cycle of length $p-1$.\n\nSince $p-1 \\mid k$, the powers of integers modulo $p$ will repeat in a cycle of length $p-1$. This means that the sum of the first $p-1$ powers of integers modulo $p$ will be congruent to $-1$ modulo $p$.\n\nTo see this, consider the sum of the first $p-1$ powers of integers modulo $p$. We can pair up the terms as follows:\n\n$1^{k}+2^{k}+\\cdots+(p-1)^{k} = (1^{k}+(p-1)^{k}) + (2^{k}+(p-2)^{k}) + \\cdots + ((p-2)^{k}+2^{k}) + (p-1)^{k}+1^{k}$\n\nNow, notice that each pair of terms is congruent to $-1$ modulo $p$. For example, $(1^{k}+(p-1)^{k}) \\equiv -1(p)$ because $1^{k} \\equiv 1(p)$ and $(p-1)^{k} \\equiv -1(p)$.\n\nSince each pair of terms is congruent to $-1$ modulo $p$, the entire sum is congruent to $-1$ modulo $p$.

We can rewrite this as $p = A^{2} + 64B^{2} = (A + 8B)(A - 8B)$. Since $p \\equiv 1(4)$, we know that $p$ is of the form $4k + 1$ for some integer $k$. This means that $p$ can be written as $p = 4k + 1 = (2k + 1)^{2}$. However, this is not the only form that $p$ can take.

The half-angle formula states that $\\sin (x/2) = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{1 - \\cos x}{2}}$.\n\nApplying this formula to $x = \\pi / 3$, we get $\\sin (\\pi / 6) = \\sqrt{\\frac{1 - \\cos (\\pi / 3)}{2}}$. Since $\\cos (\\pi / 3) = 1/2$, we have $\\sin (\\pi / 6) = \\sqrt{\\frac{1 - 1/2}{2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nNow, we can use the fact that $\\sin (\\pi / 12) = \\sin (\\pi / 6) \\cos (\\pi / 24) + \\cos (\\pi / 6) \\sin (\\pi / 24)$, which is a known trigonometric identity.\n\nSubstituting the values of $\\sin (\\pi / 6)$ and $\\cos (\\pi / 6)$, we get $\\sin (\\pi / 12) = \\frac{1}{2} \\cos (\\pi / 24) + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\sin (\\pi / 24)$.\n\nUsing the fact that $\\cos (\\pi / 24) = \\cos (\\pi / 4 - \\pi / 12)$ and $\\sin (\\pi / 24) = \\sin (\\pi / 4 - \\pi / 12)$, we can apply the angle subtraction formulas for cosine and sine.\n\nAfter simplifying the expressions, we can express $\\sin (\\pi / 12)$ in terms of $\\cos (\\pi / 4)$ and $\\sin (\\pi / 4)$, which are both known algebraic numbers.\n\nThis shows that $\\sin (\\pi / 12)$ can be expressed as a combination of algebraic numbers, and therefore it is itself an algebraic number.\n\nNote that this proof relies on the fact that the cosine and sine functions can be expressed in terms of the roots of certain polynomials, and that these polynomials have algebraic coefficients. This is a key property of the trigonometric functions, and it allows us to show that many of their values are algebraic numbers.\nPrevious attempt failed with: invalid constructor \u27e8...\u27e9, insufficient number of arguments, constructs 'Finsupp.mk' has #3 explicit fields, but only #2 provided\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  OfNat (Finset \u2115) 4\nnumerals are polymorphic in Lean, but the numeral `4` cannot be used in a context where the expected type is\n  Finset \u2115\ndue to the absence of the instance above\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nunsolved goals\n\u22a2 \u00ac{ support := sorryAx (Finset \u2115) true, toFun := 0, mem_support_toFun := \u22ef } = 0 \u2227\n    (Polynomial.aeval (\u03c0 / 12).sin)\n        { toFinsupp := { support := sorryAx (Finset \u2115) true, toFun := 0, mem_support_toFun := \u22ef } } =\n      0\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  OfNat (Finset \u2115) 4\nnumerals are polymorphic in Lean, but the numeral `4` cannot be used in a context where the expected type is\n  Finset \u2115\ndue to the absence of the instance above\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nunsolved goals\n\u22a2 \u2115 \u2192 \u211a\nunsolved goals\n\u22a2 \u00ac{ support := sorryAx (Finset \u2115) true, toFun := sorryAx (\u2115 \u2192 \u211a) true, mem_support_toFun := \u22ef } = 0 \u2227\n    (Polynomial.aeval (\u03c0 / 12).sin)\n        { toFinsupp := { support := sorryAx (Finset \u2115) true, toFun := sorryAx (\u2115 \u2192 \u211a) true, mem_support_toFun := \u22ef } } =\n      0\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "# Informal Proof:\n\nTo prove the given statement, let's start by understanding what it's asking for. However, the problem statement seems incomplete. Assuming the problem statement is \"Let a, b, and c be real numbers such that a + b + c = 0,\" we can proceed with the proof.\n\nLet's assume a, b, and c are real numbers that satisfy the equation a + b + c = 0. We want to show that this implies some other property or relationship among a, b, and c.\n\nOne way to approach this is to try to manipulate the given equation to get some useful information. Since a + b + c = 0, we can rearrange the terms to get c = -a - b. This gives us a way to express c in terms of a and b.\n\nNow, let's consider the expression a^2 + b^2 + c^2. We can substitute the expression for c that we found earlier: a^2 + b^2 + (-a - b)^2. Expanding the squared term, we get a^2 + b^2 + a^2 + 2ab + b^2.\n\nCombining like terms, we get 2a^2 + 2b^2 + 2ab. This expression looks interesting, but we can simplify it further by factoring out the common factor of 2: 2(a^2 + b^2 + ab).\n\nNow, let's recall the original equation a + b + c = 0. We can square both sides of this equation to get (a + b + c)^2 = 0. Expanding the squared term, we get a^2 + 2ab + b^2 + 2ac + 2bc + c^2 = 0.\n\nSubstituting the expression c = -a - b into this equation, we get a^2 + 2ab + b^2 - 2a^2 - 2ab - 2b^2 = 0. Simplifying this expression, we get -a^2 - b^2 = 0.\n\nMultiplying both sides of this equation by -1, we get a^2 + b^2 = 0. This implies that a^2 = -b^2, which means that a^2 is equal to the negative of b^2.\n\nNow, let's go back to the expression 2(a^2 + b^2 + ab) that we found earlier. We can substitute the expression a^2 = -b^2 into this equation: 2(-b^2 + b^2 + ab).\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get 2ab. This is a very interesting result, as it shows that the expression 2(a^2 + b^2 + ab) simplifies to 2ab.\n\nRecall that we started with the equation a + b + c = 0. We can rearrange the terms to get c = -a - b.

Our goal is to find unique positive integers $a$ and $n$ that satisfy this equation.\n\nFirst, we can rewrite the equation as $a^{n+1}-(a+1)^n=2001$, which can be further simplified to $a^{n+1}-(a+1)^n+1=2002$. This step is essentially adding 1 to both sides of the equation to make it easier to work with.\n\nNow, let's consider the expression $(a+1)^n$. We can expand this using the binomial theorem, which states that for any positive integer $n$, $(x+y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} x^{n-k}y^k$. Applying this to our expression, we get $(a+1)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n-k}1^k$.\n\nSimplifying the expression, we get $(a+1)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n-k}$. Now, let's substitute this back into our original equation: $a^{n+1} - \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} + 1 = 2002$.\n\nNotice that the term $a^{n+1}$ is present in the equation, which suggests that we might be able to factor out $a^{n+1}$ from the sum. However, we need to be careful because the sum contains terms with different powers of $a$.\n\nLet's examine the sum more closely. We can rewrite the sum as $\\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} = a^n + \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n-k}$. Now, we can see that the term $a^n$ is present in the sum, which means that we can factor out $a^n$ from the sum.\n\nFactoring out $a^n$, we get $a^{n+1} - a^n - \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} + 1 = 2002$. Now, let's simplify the equation further.\n\nNotice that the term $a^n$ is present in the equation, which suggests that we might be able to factor out $a^n$ from the sum. However, we need to be careful because the sum contains terms with different powers of $a$.\n\nLet's examine the sum more closely. We can rewrite the sum as $\\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n-k}$.

Since $f^{\\prime \\prime \\prime}(x) \\leq f(x)$, we can say that $f^{\\prime \\prime}(x)$ is increasing at a rate less than or equal to $f(x)$. \n\nNow, let's consider the derivative of $f^{\\prime}(x)$, which is $f^{\\prime \\prime}(x)$. Since $f^{\\prime \\prime}(x)$ is increasing, we can say that $f^{\\prime}(x)$ is also increasing. \n\nWe want to show that $f^{\\prime}(x) < 2f(x)$ for all $x$. To do this, let's consider the function $g(x) = f^{\\prime}(x) - 2f(x)$. \n\nWe know that $g^{\\prime}(x) = f^{\\prime \\prime}(x) - 2f^{\\prime}(x)$. Since $f^{\\prime \\prime}(x) \\geq 0$ (because $f^{\\prime \\prime \\prime}(x) \\leq f(x)$ and $f^{\\prime \\prime \\prime}(x)$ is the derivative of $f^{\\prime \\prime}(x)$), we can say that $g^{\\prime}(x) \\leq -2f^{\\prime}(x)$. \n\nNow, let's consider the function $h(x) = e^{-2x}g(x)$. The derivative of $h(x)$ is $h^{\\prime}(x) = -2e^{-2x}g(x) + e^{-2x}g^{\\prime}(x)$. \n\nSubstituting the expression for $g^{\\prime}(x)$, we get $h^{\\prime}(x) = -2e^{-2x}g(x) + e^{-2x}(-2f^{\\prime}(x)) = -2e^{-2x}g(x) - 2e^{-2x}f^{\\prime}(x)$. \n\nSince $f^{\\prime \\prime \\prime}(x) \\leq f(x)$, we know that $f^{\\prime \\prime}(x)$ is increasing at a rate less than or equal to $f(x)$. This means that $f^{\\prime}(x)$ is increasing at a rate less than or equal to $f(x)$. \n\nTherefore, we can say that $f^{\\prime}(x) \\leq f(x) + C$ for some constant $C$. \n\nSubstituting this into the expression for $h^{\\prime}(x)$, we get $h^{\\prime}(x) = -2e^{-2x}g(x) - 2e^{-2x}(f(x) + C) = -2e^{-2x}g(x) - 2e^{-2x}f(x) - 2Ce^{-2x}$. \n\nSince $f(x)$, $f^{\\prime}(x)$, and $f^{\\prime \\prime}(x)$ are positive for all $x$, we know that $f(x) > 0$ for all $x$. \n\nTherefore, we can say that $h^{\\prime}(x) < 0$ for all $x$. \n\nThis means that $h(x)$ is a decreasing function for all $x$. \n\nSince $h(x) = e^{-2x}g(x)$, we know that $g(x) = e^{2x}h(x)$. \n\nSince $h(x)$ is decreasing for all $x$, we know that $g(x)$ is also decreasing for all $x$. \n\nWe know that $g(x) = f^{\\prime}(x) - 2f(x)$. \n\nSince $g(x)$ is decreasing for all $x$, we know that $f^{\\prime}(x) - 2f(x)$ is decreasing for all $x$. \n\nThis means that $f^{\\prime}(x)$ is decreasing at a rate greater than or equal to $2f(x)$. \n\nSince $f^{\\prime \\prime \\prime}(x) \\leq f(x)$, we know that $f^{\\prime \\prime}(x)$ is increasing at a rate less than or equal to $f(x)$. \n\nThis means that $f^{\\prime}(x)$ is increasing at a rate less than or equal to $f(x)$. \n\nTherefore, we can say that $f^{\\prime}(x)$ is increasing at a rate less than or equal to $f(x)$ and decreasing at a rate greater than or equal to $2f(x)$. \n\nThis is a contradiction, because a function cannot be both increasing and decreasing at the same time. \n\nTherefore, we must have $g(x) < 0$ for all $x$. \n\nThis means that $f^{\\prime}(x) - 2f(x) < 0$ for all $x$. \n\nTherefore, we can conclude that $f^{\\prime}(x) < 2f(x)$ for all $x$.\nPrevious attempt failed with: type mismatch\n  hf1 1 ?m.931 x\nhas type\n  iteratedDeriv 1 f x > 0 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  0 < deriv f x : Prop\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: linarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase h\nf : \u211d \u2192 \u211d\nhf : ContDiff \u211d 3 f\nhf1 : \u2200 n \u2264 3, \u2200 (x : \u211d), iteratedDeriv n f x > 0\nhf2 : \u2200 (x : \u211d), iteratedDeriv 3 f x \u2264 f x\nx : \u211d\nh1 : 0 < iteratedDeriv 0 f x\nh2 : 0 < iteratedDeriv 1 f x\nh3 : 0 < iteratedDeriv 2 f x\nh4 : 0 < iteratedDeriv 3 f x\nh5 : iteratedDeriv 3 f x \u2264 f x\nh6 : 0 < f x\na\u271d : deriv f x \u2265 2 * f x\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "# Informal Proof:\n\nTo prove that for any integers $a, b, c$, there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $\\sqrt{n^3+a n^2+b n+c}$ is not an integer, we can start by considering the properties of the expression under the square root.\n\nLet's assume that for a given $n$, the expression $\\sqrt{n^3+a n^2+b n+c}$ is an integer. This means that the expression can be written as $k$, where $k$ is an integer.\n\nSquaring both sides of the equation, we get:\n\n$n^3+a n^2+b n+c = k^2$\n\nRearranging the terms, we have:\n\n$n^3+a n^2+b n+c-k^2=0$\n\nThis is a cubic equation in terms of $n$. However, the coefficients of the cubic equation are not all integers, since $c$ and $k^2$ are not necessarily integers.\n\nNow, let's consider the properties of cubic equations. A cubic equation can have at most three distinct roots. However, since $n$ is a positive integer, we know that $n$ cannot be negative or zero.\n\nFurthermore, if the cubic equation has three distinct roots, then at least one of the roots must be a positive integer. However, this would imply that the expression $\\sqrt{n^3+a n^2+b n+c}$ is an integer for that particular value of $n$, which contradicts our assumption.\n\nOn the other hand, if the cubic equation has only one or two distinct roots, then the expression $\\sqrt{n^3+a n^2+b n+c}$ cannot be an integer for all values of $n$. This is because the expression would be an integer only for a specific value of $n$, which contradicts the fact that the cubic equation has only one or two distinct roots.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the cubic equation $n^3+a n^2+b n+c-k^2=0$ must have three distinct roots, but this is impossible since the coefficients of the cubic equation are not all integers.\n\nHowever, this is not the end of the proof. We need to show that there exists a positive integer $n$ such that the expression $\\sqrt{n^3+a n^2+b n+c}$ is not an integer.\n\nTo do this, let's consider the expression $n^3+a n^2+b n+c$. We can rewrite this expression as:\n\n$n^3+a n^2+b n+c = n^2(n+a) + b n + c$\n\nNow, let's consider the values of $n$ that make the expression $n^2(n+a) + b n + c$ a perfect square. If $n^2(n+a) + b n + c$ is a perfect square, then it can be written as $m^2$, where $m$ is an integer.\n\nHowever, this would imply that the expression $\\sqrt{n^3+a n^2+b n+c}$ is an integer, which contradicts our assumption.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that there exists a positive integer $n$ such that the expression $\\sqrt{n^3+a n^2+b n+c}$ is not an integer.\n\nTo find such a value of $n$, we can try to find a value of $n$ that makes the expression $n^2(n+a) + b n + c$ not a perfect square. One way to do this is to try to find a value of $n$ that makes the expression $n^2(n+a) + b n + c$ have a remainder of 1 when divided by 4.\n\nIf we can find such a value of $n$, then we can conclude that the expression $\\sqrt{n^3+a n^2+b n+c}$ is not an integer.\n\nTo see why this is the case, let's consider the expression $n^2(n+a) + b n + c$ modulo 4. We can rewrite this expression as:\n\n$n^2(n+a) + b n + c \\equiv n^2(n+a) + b n \\pmod{4}$\n\nSince $n$ is a positive integer, we know that $n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$ or $n \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$.\n\nIf $n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, then we have:\n\n$n^2(n+a) + b n \\equiv 1(1+a) + b \\pmod{4}$\n\nIf $n \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$, then we have:\n\n$n^2(n+a) + b n \\equiv 3(3+a) + b \\pmod{4}$\n\nIn either case, we can see that the expression $n^2(n+a) + b n$ has a remainder of 1 when divided by 4.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that there exists a positive integer $n$ such that the expression $\\sqrt{n^3+a n^2+b n+c}$ is not an integer.\n\nThis completes the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: \nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unsolved goals\na b c m : \u2124\nhm : \u221a(1 + \u2191a + \u2191b + \u2191c) = \u2191m\n\u22a2 1 = \u221a(1 + \u2191a + \u2191b + \u2191c)\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase h.right.intro\na b c m : \u2124\nhm : \u221a(1 + \u2191a + \u2191b + \u2191c) = \u2191m\nthis : 1 = \u2191m\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nPlease revise the proof.",
