We want to show that if the imaginary part of \\( f \\), denoted as \\( \\text{Im}(f) \\), is constant throughout \\( \\Omega \\), then the function \\( f \\) itself must be constant.\n\nFirst, let's express the function \\( f \\) in terms of its real and imaginary components. We can write:\n\\[\nf(z) = u(x, y) + i v(x, y)\n\\]\nwhere \\( z = x + i y \\), and \\( u(x, y) \\) and \\( v(x, y) \\) are real-valued functions representing the real and imaginary parts of \\( f \\), respectively.\n\nGiven that \\( \\text{Im}(f) \\) is constant, it means that \\( v(x, y) \\) does not change as \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) vary within \\( \\Omega \\). In other words, the partial derivatives of \\( v \\) with respect to both \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are zero:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} = 0\n\\]\n\nSince \\( f \\) is holomorphic, it must satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations, which relate the partial derivatives of \\( u \\) and \\( v \\):\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = -\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x}\n\\]\nSubstituting the fact that the partial derivatives of \\( v \\) are zero, these equations simplify to:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = 0\n\\]\nThis tells us that the function \\( u(x, y) \\) also has zero partial derivatives with respect to both \\( x \\) and \\( y \\). Therefore, \\( u \\) must be constant throughout \\( \\Omega \\).\n\nSince both the real part \\( u \\) and the imaginary part \\( v \\) of the function \\( f \\) are constant, it follows that \\( f \\) itself does not change within \\( \\Omega \\). In other words, \\( f \\) is a constant function on \\( \\Omega \\).\n\nThus, we have shown that if a holomorphic function has a constant imaginary part on an open set, the function must be constant on that set.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ':='; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ':='; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ':='; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "# Informal Proof:\n\nTo demonstrate that the power series \\(\\sum n z^n\\) does not converge at any point on the unit circle (where \\(|z| = 1\\)), let's analyze the behavior of its terms and apply fundamental principles of series convergence.\n\n1. **Understanding the Terms:**\n   Consider the general term of the series, \\(n z^n\\). On the unit circle, the magnitude of \\(z\\) is 1, i.e., \\(|z| = 1\\). Therefore, the magnitude of each term is:\n   \\[\n   |n z^n| = n |z|^n = n \\times 1^n = n\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to \\(|n z^n| = n\\), meaning the size of each term grows linearly with \\(n\\).\n\n2. **Necessary Condition for Convergence:**\n   For any infinite series \\(\\sum a_n\\) to converge, a necessary (though not sufficient) condition is that the terms \\(a_n\\) approach zero as \\(n\\) approaches infinity. In mathematical terms:\n   \\[\n   \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} a_n = 0\n   \\]\n   If this condition fails, the series cannot converge.\n\n3. **Applying the Condition to Our Series:**\n   In our case, the terms are \\(a_n = n z^n\\), and we've established that \\(|a_n| = n\\). As \\(n\\) increases, \\(n\\) itself grows without bound:\n   \\[\n   \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} |a_n| = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} n = \\infty\n   \\]\n   Since the magnitude of the terms does not approach zero (in fact, it grows indefinitely), the necessary condition for convergence is violated.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   Because the terms \\(n z^n\\) do not tend to zero on the unit circle, the series \\(\\sum n z^n\\) cannot converge at any point where \\(|z| = 1\\). Therefore, the power series diverges everywhere on the unit circle.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  IsAbsoluteValue fun i => ?m.52880 i * z ^ i\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  OrderedSemiring \u2102\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nunknown identifier 'abs_of_nat'\ntype mismatch\n  sum_range_id n\nhas type\n  \u2211 i \u2208 range n, i = n * (n - 1) / 2 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u2211 i \u2208 range n, \u2191i = \u2191n * (\u2191n - 1) / 2 : Prop\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase a\nz : \u2102\nhz : Complex.abs z = 1\ns : \u2115 \u2192 \u2102\nh : s = fun n => \u2211 i \u2208 range n, \u2191i * z ^ i\ny : \u2102\nh_tendsto : Tendsto s atTop (\ud835\udcdd y)\nn : \u2115\na\u271d : \u2191n > \u2191n * (\u2191n - 1) / 2\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\napplication type mismatch\n  abv_sum_le_sum_abv (fun i => i * z ^ i) (range n)\nargument\n  range n\nhas type\n  Finset \u2115 : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  ?m.52817 \u2192 \u2102 : Type ?u.52814\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase a\nz : \u2102\nhz : Complex.abs z = 1\ns : \u2115 \u2192 \u2102\nh : s = fun n => \u2211 i \u2208 range n, \u2191i * z ^ i\ny : \u2102\nh_tendsto : Tendsto s atTop (\ud835\udcdd y)\nh_abs : \u2200 (n : \u2115), Complex.abs (s n) \u2265 \u2191n\nn m : \u2115\nhnm : n \u2264 m\na\u271d : \u2191n > \u2191m\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\nz : \u2102\nhz : Complex.abs z = 1\ns : \u2115 \u2192 \u2102\nh : s = fun n => \u2211 i \u2208 range n, \u2191i * z ^ i\ny : \u2102\nh_tendsto : Tendsto s atTop (\ud835\udcdd y)\nh_abs : \u2200 (n : \u2115), Complex.abs (s n) \u2265 \u2191n\nn : \u211d\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nunknown identifier 'not_tendsto_atTop_of_tendsto_atTop'\nunknown identifier 'tendsto_abs_nhds_within_zero.comp'\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'abs_of_nat'\nambiguous, possible interpretations \n  _root_.abs_pow : \u2200 (a : ?m.8430) (n : \u2115), |a ^ n| = |a| ^ n\n  \n  Complex.abs_pow : \u2200 (z : \u2102) (n : \u2115), Complex.abs (z ^ n) = Complex.abs z ^ n\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase succ.a\nz : \u2102\nhz : Complex.abs z = 1\ns : \u2115 \u2192 \u2102\nh : s = fun n => \u2211 i \u2208 range n, \u2191i * z ^ i\ny : \u2102\nh_tendsto : Tendsto s atTop (\ud835\udcdd y)\nn : \u2115\nih : Complex.abs (\u2211 i \u2208 range n, \u2191i * z ^ i) \u2265 \u2191n\na\u271d : \u2191n + 1 > Complex.abs (\u2191n * z ^ n + \u2211 x \u2208 range n, \u2191x * z ^ x)\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\napplication type mismatch\n  abs_le_abs (s n)\nargument\n  s n\nhas type\n  \u2102 : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  ?m.12922 \u2264 ?m.12923 : Prop\napplication type mismatch\n  s n\nargument\n  n\nhas type\n  \u211d : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u2115 : Type\nfailed to synthesize\n  Lattice \u2102\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nunknown identifier 'not_tendsto_atTop_of_tendsto_atTop'\nunknown identifier 'tendsto_abs_nhds_within_zero.comp'\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'rewrite' failed, equality or iff proof expected\n  |?a + ?b| \u2264 |?a| + |?b|\ncase succ\nz : \u2102\nhz : Complex.abs z = 1\ns : \u2115 \u2192 \u2102\nh : s = fun n => \u2211 i \u2208 range n, \u2191i * z ^ i\ny : \u2102\nh_tendsto : Tendsto s atTop (\ud835\udcdd y)\nn : \u2115\nih : Complex.abs (\u2211 i \u2208 range n, \u2191i * z ^ i) \u2265 \u2191n\n\u22a2 Complex.abs (\u2191n * z ^ n + \u2211 x \u2208 range n, \u2191x * z ^ x) \u2265 \u2191n + 1\napplication type mismatch\n  abs_le_abs (s n)\nargument\n  s n\nhas type\n  \u2102 : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  ?m.9845 \u2264 ?m.9846 : Prop\napplication type mismatch\n  s n\nargument\n  n\nhas type\n  \u211d : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u2115 : Type\nfailed to synthesize\n  Lattice \u2102\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\napplication type mismatch\n  tendsto_of_tendsto_of_tendsto_of_le_of_le' tendsto_const_nhds this\nargument\n  this\nhas type\n  Tendsto (fun n => Complex.abs (s n)) atTop atTop : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  Tendsto (fun n => Complex.abs (s n)) atTop (\ud835\udcdd ?m.15539) : Prop\nunknown identifier 'not_tendsto_atTop_of_tendsto_atTop'\nPlease revise the proof.",

Our goal is to show that this series converges for every such \\( z \\) except when \\( z = 1 \\).\n\n1. **When \\( |z| < 1 \\):**\n   \n   First, observe that when the magnitude of \\( z \\) is less than 1, the series \\( \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{z^n}{n} \\) converges absolutely. This is because the terms \\( \\frac{|z|^n}{n} \\) form a convergent series. Specifically, since \\( |z| < 1 \\), the expression \\( |z|^n \\) decays exponentially as \\( n \\) increases, and dividing by \\( n \\) ensures that the terms become sufficiently small to guarantee convergence.\n\n2. **When \\( |z| = 1 \\) and \\( z \\neq 1 \\):**\n   \n   Now, let's examine points \\( z \\) on the unit circle where \\( z \\) is not equal to 1. Such a \\( z \\) can be expressed in the form \\( z = e^{i\\theta} \\) for some real number \\( \\theta \\) not equal to zero (modulo \\( 2\\pi \\)). The series becomes \\( \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{e^{i n \\theta}}{n} \\).\n\n   To determine convergence, we use **Dirichlet's Test**, which is applicable here because:\n\n   - The sequence \\( \\frac{1}{n} \\) is monotonically decreasing and approaches zero as \\( n \\) increases.\n   - The partial sums of \\( e^{i n \\theta} \\), specifically \\( \\sum_{k=1}^N e^{i k \\theta} \\), remain bounded regardless of \\( N \\). This is due to the oscillatory nature of the exponential terms, which causes the partial sums to not grow without bound.\n\n   Since both conditions of Dirichlet's Test are satisfied, the series \\( \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{e^{i n \\theta}}{n} \\) converges. Importantly, this convergence is **conditional**, meaning that while the series converges, it does not do so absolutely. Absolute convergence would require that \\( \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{|z|^n}{n} \\) converges, which is not the case here since \\( |z| = 1 \\).\n\n3. **When \\( z = 1 \\):**\n   \n   Finally, consider the point \\( z = 1 \\). Substituting \\( z = 1 \\) into the series gives \\( \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1^n}{n} = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n} \\), which is the well-known **harmonic series**. The harmonic series diverges, meaning it grows without bound as more terms are added.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nPutting it all together, the power series \\( \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{z^n}{n} \\) converges absolutely for all complex numbers \\( z \\) inside the unit circle (\\( |z| < 1 \\)) and converges conditionally for all points on the unit circle (\\( |z| = 1 \\)) except at \\( z = 1 \\), where it diverges.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why this integral equals \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\):\n\n1. **Understanding the Integral**: The integral \\(\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\sin x}{x} \\, dx\\) involves the sine function divided by \\(x\\), integrated from zero to infinity. At first glance, this might seem challenging due to the oscillatory nature of the sine function and the improper limits of integration.\n\n2. **Introducing a Parameter**: Let's generalize the problem by introducing a positive parameter \\(p\\), and consider the integral \\(\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\sin(p x)}{x} \\, dx\\). This modification doesn't change the essence of the problem but allows for a substitution that simplifies the evaluation.\n\n3. **Making a Substitution**: We perform a substitution by letting \\(t = p x\\). This means that \\(x = \\frac{t}{p}\\) and \\(dx = \\frac{dt}{p}\\). Substituting these into the integral, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\sin(p x)}{x} \\, dx = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\sin t}{\\frac{t}{p}} \\cdot \\frac{dt}{p} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\sin t}{t} \\, dt\n   \\]\n   Notice that the \\(p\\) terms cancel out, leaving us with the integral \\(\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\sin t}{t} \\, dt\\).\n\n4. **Applying the Dirichlet Integral**: The integral \\(\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\sin t}{t} \\, dt\\) is a classic result known as the Dirichlet Integral, and it is established that:\n   \\[\n   \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\sin t}{t} \\, dt = \\frac{\\pi}{2}\n   \\]\n   This result is derived using techniques from Fourier analysis or by evaluating the improper integral through contour integration in complex analysis.\n\n5. **Finalizing the Result**: Since our substitution led us directly to the Dirichlet Integral, we conclude that:\n   \\[\n   \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\sin(p x)}{x} \\, dx = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\quad \\text{for any } p > 0\n   \\]\n   Specifically, when \\(p = 1\\), which corresponds to our original problem, the integral simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\sin x}{x} \\, dx = \\frac{\\pi}{2}\n   \\]\n   \nTherefore, by leveraging substitution and the known value of the Dirichlet Integral, we have shown that the integral of \\(\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\) from zero to infinity is indeed \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'integral_sin_div_x_eq_pi_div_two_of_pos'\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown namespace 'Complex'\nunknown namespace 'BigOperators'\nexpected token\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown namespace 'Real'\nunknown namespace 'Topology'\nexpected token\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

Our goal is to show that \\( f \\) must actually be a polynomial.\n\nHere's how we can think about this:\n\n1. **Understanding the Taylor Series Expansion:**\n   For any point \\( z_0 \\), since \\( f \\) is analytic there, it can be expressed as a Taylor series:\n   \\[\n   f(z) = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty c_n (z - z_0)^n\n   \\]\n   The coefficients \\( c_n \\) are related to the derivatives of \\( f \\) at \\( z_0 \\) by:\n   \\[\n   c_n = \\frac{f^{(n)}(z_0)}{n!}\n   \\]\n   The condition in the problem tells us that for every \\( z_0 \\), there is at least one \\( n \\) for which \\( c_n = 0 \\).

In other words, for every \\( n \\), \\( f^{(n)} \\) is not identically zero across the entire complex plane.\n\n3. **Analyzing the Zeros of the Derivatives:**\n   Each derivative \\( f^{(n)} \\), being an entire function itself, has zeros that are isolated unless the function is identically zero. However, our condition states that for every point \\( z_0 \\), there's some derivative that vanishes at that point. If \\( f \\) had infinitely many non-zero derivatives, each \\( f^{(n)} \\) would have zeros scattered throughout the plane, but these zeros are isolated for each fixed \\( n \\).\n\n4. **Contradiction Arises:**\n   If \\( f \\) were not a polynomial, there would be infinitely many derivatives \\( f^{(n)} \\) each having their own isolated zeros. However, the condition requires that **every** point \\( z_0 \\) is a zero for **some** derivative \\( f^{(n)} \\). This would imply that every point in the complex plane is covered by the zeros of these infinitely many isolated zeros, which is impossible. The complex plane is uncountably infinite, and isolated zeros from infinitely many derivatives can't cover the entire plane.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   Therefore, our initial assumption that \\( f \\) is not a polynomial leads to a contradiction. The only way to satisfy the condition\u2014that every point \\( z_0 \\) has some derivative of \\( f \\) vanishing there\u2014is if \\( f \\) has only finitely many non-zero derivatives. This means that \\( f \\) must be a polynomial of finite degree.\n\nThus, we've shown that under the given conditions, \\( f \\) cannot have infinitely many non-zero derivatives and must indeed be a polynomial.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ':='; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ':='; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ':='; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

An *injective* function is one that maps distinct inputs to distinct outputs; that is, if \\( f(z_1) = f(z_2) \\), then \\( z_1 = z_2 \\).\n\n2. **Analyzing the Derivative:**\n   Since \\( f \\) is entire and injective, it is not constant (a constant function cannot be injective unless it maps the entire plane to a single point, which violates injectivity). For \\( f \\) to be injective and entire, its derivative \\( f'(z) \\) must never be zero. If \\( f'(z) \\) were zero at some point \\( z_0 \\), then by the complex version of the inverse function theorem, \\( f \\) would not be locally injective around \\( z_0 \\), contradicting our assumption.\n\n3. **Considering the Reciprocal of the Derivative:**\n   Since \\( f'(z) \\) is entire (being the derivative of an entire function) and never zero, the reciprocal \\( \\frac{1}{f'(z)} \\) is also an entire function. This is because the reciprocal of a non-vanishing entire function maintains holomorphy across the entire complex plane.\n\n4. **Applying Liouville's Theorem:**\n   Liouville's Theorem states that any bounded entire function must be constant. To use this, we need to examine whether \\( \\frac{1}{f'(z)} \\) is bounded. However, without loss of generality, suppose \\( \\frac{1}{f'(z)} \\) is not bounded; then \\( f'(z) \\) would approach zero as \\( z \\) approaches infinity, which would imply that \\( f(z) \\) grows slower than any linear function, contradicting the fact that \\( f \\) is entire and injective.\n\n   Therefore, to satisfy Liouville's Theorem without contradiction, \\( \\frac{1}{f'(z)} \\) must be a constant function. This means that \\( f'(z) \\) itself is a constant.\n\n5. **Integrating the Constant Derivative:**\n   If \\( f'(z) = a \\), where \\( a \\) is a non-zero constant (since \\( f'(z) \\) cannot be zero), then integrating both sides with respect to \\( z \\) gives:\n   \\[\n   f(z) = az + b\n   \\]\n   where \\( b \\) is the constant of integration, also a complex number.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   Therefore, the only entire and injective functions are linear functions of the form \\( f(z) = az + b \\) with \\( a \\neq 0 \\).

These zeros can be arranged as a sequence \\(z_1, z_2, \\ldots\\), each satisfying \\(|z_n| < 1\\).\n\nTo understand the distribution of these zeros, consider constructing a product that accounts for each zero. A natural candidate for such a product is the Blaschke product, which is defined as\n\\[\nB(z) = \\prod_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{|z_n|}{z_n} \\frac{z_n - z}{1 - \\overline{z_n} z}.\n\\]\nFor this infinite product to converge and define a bounded holomorphic function, the sequence of zeros must satisfy a specific condition known as the Blaschke condition:\n\\[\n\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty (1 - |z_n|) < \\infty.\n\\]\nThis condition ensures that the factors in the Blaschke product do not \"accumulate\" too rapidly near the boundary of the unit disc, allowing the infinite product to converge uniformly on compact subsets of the disc.\n\nSince \\(f\\) is bounded and holomorphic with zeros at \\(z_n\\), it can be factored as \\(f(z) = B(z) \\cdot g(z)\\), where \\(g(z)\\) is another bounded holomorphic function without zeros in the unit disc. The boundedness of \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) implies that the Blaschke product \\(B(z)\\) must also be bounded. Therefore, the Blaschke condition must hold for the zeros \\(z_n\\) of \\(f\\).\n\nIn other words, the requirement that the Blaschke product converges (ensuring \\(B(z)\\) is bounded and holomorphic) directly imposes that the sum \\(\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty (1 - |z_n|)\\) must be finite. If this sum were infinite, the Blaschke product would fail to converge, contradicting the boundedness of \\(f\\).\n\nThus, we conclude that for a bounded, non-zero holomorphic function \\(f\\) in the unit disc, the sum of \\(1 - |z_n|\\) over all zeros \\(z_n\\) of \\(f\\) must indeed be finite.",

Similarly, the squared norm of the sum or difference of two vectors can be expanded using the distributive property of the inner product.\n\nLet's start by expanding |**x** + **y**|\u00b2:\n- |**x** + **y**|\u00b2 = (**x** + **y**) \u00b7 (**x** + **y**)\n- Applying the distributive property: **x**\u00b7**x** + **x**\u00b7**y** + **y**\u00b7**x** + **y**\u00b7**y**\n- Since the inner product is commutative, **x**\u00b7**y** = **y**\u00b7**x**, so this simplifies to |**x**|\u00b2 + 2(**x**\u00b7**y**) + |**y**|\u00b2\n\nNext, expand |**x** \u2212 **y**|\u00b2:\n- |**x** \u2212 **y**|\u00b2 = (**x** \u2212 **y**) \u00b7 (**x** \u2212 **y**)\n- Applying the distributive property: **x**\u00b7**x** \u2212 **x**\u00b7**y** \u2212 **y**\u00b7**x** + **y**\u00b7**y**\n- Again, using the commutative property, this simplifies to |**x**|\u00b2 \u2212 2(**x**\u00b7**y**) + |**y**|\u00b2\n\nNow, add the two results together:\n- |**x** + **y**|\u00b2 + |**x** \u2212 **y**|\u00b2\n- = (|**x**|\u00b2 + 2(**x**\u00b7**y**) + |**y**|\u00b2) + (|**x**|\u00b2 \u2212 2(**x**\u00b7**y**) + |**y**|\u00b2)\n- Notice that the +2(**x**\u00b7**y**) and \u22122(**x**\u00b7**y**) terms cancel each other out\n- This simplifies to 2|**x**|\u00b2 + 2|**y**|\u00b2\n\nTherefore, we have shown that |**x** + **y**|\u00b2 + |**x** \u2212 **y**|\u00b2 indeed equals 2|**x**|\u00b2 + 2|**y**|\u00b2 for any vectors **x** and **y** in \u211d\u1d4f.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown namespace 'InnerProductSpace'\nexpected token\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown namespace 'InnerProductSpace'\nexpected token\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

In a metric space, being closed ensures that each set contains all its limit points, which means there are no points \"on the edge\" that belong to both sets.\n\nFor every point \\( a \\) in \\( A \\), because \\( B \\) is closed and does not contain \\( a \\), there is a positive distance between \\( a \\) and \\( B \\). Specifically, we can find a small open ball around \\( a \\) that doesn\u2019t touch \\( B \\).

Additionally, in metric spaces, compactness ensures that the space is **separable**, meaning there exists a **countable dense subset** within \\( K \\). Let's denote this countable dense subset by \\( \\{x_1, x_2, x_3, \\dots\\} \\).\n\nNext, consider the set of all possible open balls centered at each point in this dense subset with radii that are inverses of natural numbers, such as \\( \\frac{1}{n} \\) for \\( n = 1, 2, 3, \\dots \\).

Our goal is to show that the set of points in \\( E \\) that are not condensation points, denoted by \\( E \\setminus P \\), is at most countable.\n\nFirst, recall that a **condensation point** of a set \\( E \\) is a point where every neighborhood around it contains uncountably many points of \\( E \\). Conversely, if a point is **not** a condensation point of \\( E \\), there exists at least one neighborhood around it that contains only finitely or countably many points of \\( E \\).\n\nNow, take any point \\( x \\) in \\( E \\setminus P \\). By definition, \\( x \\) is not a condensation point of \\( E \\). This means there is some open neighborhood around \\( x \\) that contains only a limited number of points from \\( E \\). In \\( \\mathbb{R}^k \\), we can choose these neighborhoods to be open balls with rational radii centered at points with rational coordinates, thanks to the fact that \\( \\mathbb{R}^k \\) is a **second-countable** space (it has a countable base for its topology).\n\nEach such neighborhood can contain at most one point from \\( E \\setminus P \\). If there were uncountably many points in \\( E \\setminus P \\), we would need uncountably many disjoint neighborhoods to accommodate them, each containing exactly one point.

An open interval is any set of real numbers between two endpoints where those endpoints are not included, such as (a, b) where a < b.\n\n2. **Decomposing into Connected Components:**\n   Open sets in \u211d are also **connected**, meaning they cannot be split into two non-overlapping open sets. However, more importantly, any open set in \u211d can be broken down into **maximal connected components**, which in this case are the largest possible open intervals that fit entirely within the set. These maximal open intervals do not overlap with each other; otherwise, they could be combined into a larger interval, contradicting their maximality.\n\n3. **Disjointness of the Intervals:**\n   By construction, these maximal open intervals are **disjoint**. If two intervals overlapped, their union would form a larger open interval, meaning they weren't truly maximal. Thus, each interval stands alone without sharing any points with the others.\n\n4. **Countability of the Collection:**\n   Now, we need to show that there are at most countably many such disjoint intervals. To do this, observe that:\n   \n   - **Association with Rational Numbers:** Each open interval contains at least one rational number because the rationals are dense in \u211d. \n   \n   - **Injective Mapping:** We can assign to each disjoint open interval a unique rational number it contains. Since no two intervals overlap, each rational number is associated with exactly one interval.\n   \n   - **Countability of Rationals:** The set of rational numbers is countable, meaning there are only as many rationals as there are natural numbers. Therefore, since we've mapped each interval to a unique rational, there can be at most countably many such intervals.\n\n5. **Final Assembly:**\n   Combining these observations, any open set in \u211d is a union of these disjoint maximal open intervals, and there are only countably many of them.

This means that the sum approaches a finite limit as \\( n \\) becomes large.\n\n**Step 2: Applying the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality**\n\nThe Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality states that for any two sequences of nonnegative real numbers \\( \\{b_n\\} \\) and \\( \\{c_n\\} \\), the following holds:\n\\[\n\\left( \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty b_n c_n \\right)^2 \\leq \\left( \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty b_n^2 \\right) \\left( \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty c_n^2 \\right)\n\\]\nIn our case, let\u2019s choose:\n- \\( b_n = \\sqrt{a_n} \\)\n- \\( c_n = \\frac{1}{n} \\)\n\nApplying the inequality, we get:\n\\[\n\\left( \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{\\sqrt{a_n}}{n} \\right)^2 \\leq \\left( \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty a_n \\right) \\left( \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^2} \\right)\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Analyzing the Right-Hand Side**\n\n- **First Sum (\\( \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty a_n \\))**: By assumption, this series converges to some finite value.\n  \n- **Second Sum (\\( \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^2} \\))**: This is a known **p-series** with \\( p = 2 \\). Since \\( p > 1 \\), this series also converges (specifically, it converges to \\( \\frac{\\pi^2}{6} \\), but the exact value isn't necessary for our proof).\n\n**Step 4: Concluding the Convergence**\n\nSince both \\( \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty a_n \\) and \\( \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^2} \\) are finite, their product is also finite. Taking the square root of both sides of the inequality preserves the inequality (as all terms are nonnegative):\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{\\sqrt{a_n}}{n} \\leq \\sqrt{ \\left( \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty a_n \\right) \\left( \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^2} \\right) }\n\\]\n\nThis shows that \\( \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{\\sqrt{a_n}}{n} \\) is bounded above by a finite number. Therefore, by the **Comparison Test**, the series \\( \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{\\sqrt{a_n}}{n} \\) must also converge.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nUsing the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, we've demonstrated that if the series \\( \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty a_n \\) converges with nonnegative terms \\( a_n \\), then the series \\( \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{\\sqrt{a_n}}{n} \\) necessarily converges as well.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ':='; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ':='; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ':='; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

Taking absolute values, we have:\n\n\\[\n|c_n| = \\left| \\sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_{n - k} \\right| \\leq \\sum_{k=1}^n |a_k| \\cdot |b_{n - k}|\n\\]\n\nThis inequality comes from the triangle inequality, which allows us to bound the absolute value of a sum by the sum of absolute values.\n\nNext, to assess the convergence of \\(\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty |c_n|\\), consider the double series formed by the product of the two original absolutely convergent series:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty |a_n| \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty |b_n|\n\\]\n\nSince both are convergent, their product series is also convergent by the comparison test. Specifically, each term \\( |a_k| \\cdot |b_{n - k}| \\) is non-negative, and the double sum can be rearranged because absolute convergence allows for such manipulations without affecting convergence.\n\nBy summing over all possible combinations of \\(k\\) and \\(n - k\\), we effectively cover all possible products of terms from the two series. The convergence of the double series ensures that when we sum \\( |c_n| \\) over \\(n\\), the total sum will also converge.\n\nTherefore, the Cauchy product \\(\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty c_n\\) is absolutely convergent because the sum of the absolute values of its terms is finite.

Additionally, suppose that the diameter of these sets shrinks to zero as \\( n \\) approaches infinity, meaning \\( \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\text{diam}(E_n) = 0 \\).\n\n**Step 1: Understanding Nested Closed Sets with Shrinking Diameters**\n\nSince each \\( E_n \\) is closed and contains \\( E_{n+1} \\), we have a nested sequence of sets:\n\\[\nE_1 \\supseteq E_2 \\supseteq E_3 \\supseteq \\cdots\n\\]\nEach set is nonempty and bounded, and as \\( n \\) increases, the sets become \"tighter\" around a specific region in \\( X \\) because their diameters are getting smaller.\n\n**Step 2: Existence of a Point in the Intersection**\n\nBecause the space \\( X \\) is complete, every Cauchy sequence in \\( X \\) converges to a point within \\( X \\). Now, consider selecting a point from each \\( E_n \\). Since \\( E_n \\) is nonempty, we can choose \\( x_n \\in E_n \\) for each \\( n \\). The sequence \\( \\{x_n\\} \\) is such that each point lies in all subsequent sets:\n\\[\nx_1 \\in E_1 \\supseteq E_2, \\quad x_2 \\in E_2 \\supseteq E_3, \\quad \\text{and so on.}\n\\]\nBecause the diameters of \\( E_n \\) approach zero, the distance between any two points \\( x_m \\) and \\( x_n \\) for \\( m, n \\) large enough becomes arbitrarily small. This means \\( \\{x_n\\} \\) is a Cauchy sequence.\n\n**Step 3: Convergence to a Single Point**\n\nGiven that \\( X \\) is complete, the Cauchy sequence \\( \\{x_n\\} \\) must converge to some point \\( x \\in X \\). Since each \\( E_n \\) is closed and contains all \\( x_n \\) for sufficiently large \\( n \\), the limit point \\( x \\) must also belong to every \\( E_n \\). Therefore, \\( x \\) lies in the intersection of all \\( E_n \\):\n\\[\nx \\in \\bigcap_{n=1}^{\\infty} E_n\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Uniqueness of the Intersection Point**\n\nSuppose there were two distinct points \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) in the intersection \\( \\bigcap_{n=1}^{\\infty} E_n \\). Since the diameter of \\( E_n \\) approaches zero, the distance between \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) would have to be zero in the limit, implying \\( x = y \\). This contradiction shows that there can be at most one point in the intersection.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCombining these observations, we conclude that the intersection \\( \\bigcap_{n=1}^{\\infty} E_n \\) contains exactly one point. The completeness of the metric space ensures the existence of this point, and the shrinking diameters guarantee its uniqueness.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

Define the function \\( f \\) on \\( E \\) by \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{x} \\). \n\nFirst, observe that \\( f \\) is continuous on \\( E \\). For any \\( x \\neq 0 \\), the reciprocal function \\( \\frac{1}{x} \\) is well-defined and smooth, meaning there are no breaks or jumps in the graph of \\( f \\) within \\( E \\).\n\nNow, suppose for contradiction that there exists a continuous function \\( g \\) defined on the entire real line \\( \\mathbb{R} \\) that agrees with \\( f \\) on \\( E \\).

A function $f: X \\to Y$ is uniformly continuous if, for every $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists a $\\delta > 0$ such that for any two points $x, y$ in $X$, whenever the distance between $x$ and $y$ is less than $\\delta$ (i.e., $d_X(x, y) < \\delta$), the distance between their images under $f$ is less than $\\epsilon$ (i.e., $\\rho_Y(f(x), f(y)) < \\epsilon$). Importantly, the $\\delta$ chosen works uniformly for the entire space $X$, not depending on specific points.\n\nNow, consider that $\\{x_n\\}$ is a Cauchy sequence in $X$. By the definition of a Cauchy sequence, for every $\\delta > 0$, there exists an integer $N$ such that for all integers $m, n \\geq N$, the distance between $x_m$ and $x_n$ is less than $\\delta$ (i.e., $d_X(x_m, x_n) < \\delta$).\n\nGiven that $f$ is uniformly continuous, let's fix an arbitrary $\\epsilon > 0$. By uniform continuity, there exists a corresponding $\\delta > 0$ that satisfies the condition mentioned earlier. Since $\\{x_n\\}$ is a Cauchy sequence, there exists an integer $N$ such that for all $m, n \\geq N$, we have $d_X(x_m, x_n) < \\delta$.\n\nApplying the uniform continuity of $f$, it follows that for all $m, n \\geq N$, the distances between the images satisfy $\\rho_Y(f(x_m), f(x_n)) < \\epsilon$. This precisely means that the sequence $\\{f(x_n)\\}$ meets the criteria for being a Cauchy sequence in $Y$\u2014for every $\\epsilon > 0$, there is an integer $N$ after which all terms of the sequence are within $\\epsilon$ of each other.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that the image of a Cauchy sequence under a uniformly continuous function is itself a Cauchy sequence in the target metric space.\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  UniformContinuous.comp hf hx\nargument\n  hx\nhas type\n  CauchySeq x : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  UniformContinuous ?m.1287 : Prop\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  UniformContinuous.comp hf hx\nargument\n  hx\nhas type\n  CauchySeq x : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  UniformContinuous ?m.1287 : Prop\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  UniformContinuous.comp hf hx\nargument\n  hx\nhas type\n  CauchySeq x : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  UniformContinuous ?m.1287 : Prop\nPlease revise the proof.",

This means that there exist points where \\( f \\) does not consistently increase or decrease.\n\nSince \\( f \\) is not monotonic, there must be three points \\( x < y < z \\) in \\( \\mathbb{R} \\) such that the behavior of \\( f \\) changes direction.

Suppose we have two disjoint subsets \\( K \\) and \\( F \\) within \\( X \\), where \\( K \\) is compact and \\( F \\) is closed. Our goal is to show that there exists a positive number \\( \\delta > 0 \\) such that for any point \\( p \\) in \\( K \\) and any point \\( q \\) in \\( F \\), the distance between them satisfies \\( d(p, q) > \\delta \\).\n\nHere's how we can establish this:\n\n1. **Define a Distance Function:**  \n   First, define a function \\( f: X \\to \\mathbb{R} \\) by assigning to each point \\( x \\) in \\( X \\) the distance from \\( x \\) to the set \\( F \\). Formally, \\( f(x) = d(x, F) \\). This function measures how far each point in \\( X \\) is from the set \\( F \\).\n\n2. **Expressing the Distance Between Sets:**  \n   The distance between the sets \\( K \\) and \\( F \\) is given by the infimum of \\( f(x) \\) as \\( x \\) ranges over all points in \\( K \\). In symbols, \\( d(K, F) = \\inf_{p \\in K} f(p) \\). Our aim is to show that this infimum is actually a positive number.\n\n3. **Properties of the Sets:**  \n   - Since \\( K \\) is compact and \\( X \\) is a metric space (which is also a Hausdorff space), \\( K \\) is closed. This means \\( K \\) contains all its limit points.\n   - The set \\( F \\) is closed by assumption.\n\n4. **Positive Distance for Each Point in \\( K \\):**  \n   Assume, for contradiction, that there exists a point \\( p \\) in \\( K \\) such that \\( f(p) = 0 \\). This would mean \\( p \\) is at zero distance from \\( F \\), implying that \\( p \\) is either in \\( F \\) or is a limit point of \\( F \\). However, since \\( K \\) and \\( F \\) are disjoint and \\( K \\) is closed, \\( p \\) cannot be in \\( F \\), nor can it be a limit point of \\( F \\) without being in \\( F \\). Therefore, for every \\( p \\) in \\( K \\), \\( f(p) > 0 \\).\n\n5. **Continuity of the Distance Function:**  \n   The function \\( f \\) is continuous. In metric spaces, the distance from a point to a closed set is a continuous function. Moreover, if we restrict \\( f \\) to the compact set \\( K \\), the restricted function \\( f|_K \\) remains continuous.\n\n6. **Attainment of the Infimum:**  \n   Since \\( K \\) is compact and \\( f|_K \\) is continuous, by the Extreme Value Theorem, \\( f|_K \\) attains its minimum value on \\( K \\). This means there exists a point \\( \\alpha \\) in \\( K \\) such that \\( f(\\alpha) = \\inf_{p \\in K} f(p) \\).\n\n7. **Establishing a Positive Lower Bound:**  \n   From our earlier observation, \\( f(\\alpha) > 0 \\). Therefore, the infimum \\( d(K, F) = f(\\alpha) \\) is greater than zero. Letting \\( \\delta = f(\\alpha) \\), we have \\( \\delta > 0 \\).\n\n8. **Conclusion:**  \n   This \\( \\delta \\) serves as the positive lower bound we sought. For any \\( p \\) in \\( K \\) and any \\( q \\) in \\( F \\), the distance \\( d(p, q) \\) is at least \\( \\delta \\). Hence, \\( d(K, F) > 0 \\), proving that there exists a positive separation between the compact set \\( K \\) and the closed set \\( F \\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'infDist'\nunknown identifier 'continuous_infDist_pt'\nunknown identifier 'isClosed_of_isCompact'\ntype mismatch\n  disjoint_left.mp ?m.2724 ?m.2770\nhas type\n  p \u2209 ?m.2677 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  p \u2209 F : Prop\nunknown identifier 'mem_of_mem_of_subset'\napplication type mismatch\n  Exists.intro \u03b4\nargument\n  \u03b4\nhas type\n  X : Type u_1\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u211d : Type\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'infDist'\nunknown identifier 'continuous_infDist_pt'\napplication type mismatch\n  Set.nonempty_of_mem hK\nargument\n  hK\nhas type\n  IsCompact K : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  ?m.840 \u2208 ?m.839 : Prop\nunknown identifier 'infDist_pos_of_not_mem_of_closed'\nunknown identifier 'le_infDist.trans'\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'infDist'\nunknown identifier 'infDist_pos_of_not_mem_of_closed'\nunknown identifier 'infDist'\nunknown identifier 'infDist_le_dist_of_mem'\nunknown identifier 'inf\u209b'\nunknown constant 'Real.inf\u209b_pos'\nunknown identifier 'inf\u209b_le'\nPlease revise the proof.",

Importantly, as \\( x \\) gets closer to \\( y \\), the right-hand side \\( (x - y)^2 \\) becomes very small because it's a square of a small number.\n\n2. **Considering the Limit as \\( y \\) Approaches \\( x \\):**\n   \n   Let's fix a point \\( x \\) and let \\( y \\) approach \\( x \\). As \\( y \\) gets closer to \\( x \\), the term \\( (x - y)^2 \\) becomes negligible. This means that \\( |f(x) - f(y)| \\) must also become very small, approaching zero. In mathematical terms, this suggests that the function \\( f \\) doesn't change its value abruptly; instead, its rate of change is controlled tightly.\n\n3. **Implications for the Function's Behavior:**\n   \n   The fact that \\( |f(x) - f(y)| \\) is limited by \\( (x - y)^2 \\) implies that the function \\( f \\) changes at most as quickly as the square of the distance between points. This rate of change is slower than linear, which is significant because it suggests that the function's slope is essentially flat.\n\n4. **Differentiability and the Derivative:**\n   \n   Although we haven't formally assumed that \\( f \\) is differentiable, the behavior implied by the inequality hints that if \\( f \\) were differentiable, its derivative would be zero everywhere. This is because the slope between any two nearby points \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) becomes negligible as \\( y \\) approaches \\( x \\).\n\n5. **Concluding that \\( f \\) is Constant:**\n   \n   If the derivative of \\( f \\) is zero everywhere (assuming differentiability), then \\( f \\) must be a constant function. Even without explicitly invoking differentiability, the controlled rate of change enforced by the inequality \\( |f(x) - f(y)| \\leq (x - y)^2 \\) ensures that \\( f \\) cannot vary; any variation would violate the bound set by \\( (x - y)^2 \\).\n\n6. **Final Conclusion:**\n   \n   Therefore, under the condition that \\( |f(x) - f(y)| \\leq (x - y)^2 \\) for all real numbers \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), the function \\( f \\) must be constant across its entire domain.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

Mathematically, this means:\n\n\\[\nf(x+1) - f(x) = f'(c_x) \\cdot (x+1 - x) = f'(c_x) \\cdot 1 = f'(c_x)\n\\]\n\nSo, \\( g(x) = f'(c_x) \\).\n\nNow, we're given that \\( f'(x) \\) approaches zero as \\( x \\) approaches infinity. Specifically, \\( \\lim_{x \\to +\\infty} f'(x) = 0 \\). Since \\( c_x \\) lies between \\( x \\) and \\( x+1 \\), as \\( x \\) becomes larger and larger, \\( c_x \\) also tends to infinity.

Here's a step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem Setup:**\n   - We are given two functions, \\(f(t)\\) and \\(g(t)\\), which satisfy \\(f(x) = g(x) = 0\\). This means that at the point \\(t = x\\), both functions equal zero.\n   - The derivatives \\(f'(x)\\) and \\(g'(x)\\) exist at \\(t = x\\), and importantly, \\(g'(x) \\neq 0\\). This non-zero derivative of \\(g(t)\\) will be crucial for our proof.\n\n2. **Applying the Concept of Limits:**\n   - We aim to find the limit of the ratio \\(\\frac{f(t)}{g(t)}\\) as \\(t\\) approaches \\(x\\). Direct substitution gives \\(\\frac{0}{0}\\), which is indeterminate. This scenario is precisely where L'H\u00f4pital's Rule is applicable.\n\n3. **Introducing a Small Neighborhood Around \\(x\\):**\n   - Consider values of \\(t\\) that are very close to \\(x\\), but not equal to \\(x\\). In this \"neighborhood,\" both \\(f(t)\\) and \\(g(t)\\) are close to zero, and their behavior can be approximated by their derivatives.\n\n4. **Using the Mean Value Theorem:**\n   - By the Mean Value Theorem, for each \\(t\\) near \\(x\\), there exists some point \\(\\xi\\) between \\(t\\) and \\(x\\) where:\n     \\[\n     f(t) = f'(\u03be)(t - x) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad g(t) = g'(\u03be)(t - x)\n     \\]\n   - Dividing these two equations gives:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{f(t)}{g(t)} = \\frac{f'(\u03be)}{g'(\u03be)}\n     \\]\n   \n5. **Taking the Limit as \\(t\\) Approaches \\(x\\):**\n   - As \\(t\\) gets closer to \\(x\\), the point \\(\\xi\\) also approaches \\(x\\) because \\(\\xi\\) lies between \\(t\\) and \\(x\\).\n   - Since \\(f'(t)\\) and \\(g'(t)\\) are continuous around \\(x\\) (they exist and \\(g'(x) \\neq 0\\)), the ratio \\(\\frac{f'(\u03be)}{g'(\u03be)}\\) approaches \\(\\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}\\) as \\(\\xi \\to x\\).\n\n6. **Concluding the Limit:**\n   - Therefore, combining these observations, we have:\n     \\[\n     \\lim_{t \\to x} \\frac{f(t)}{g(t)} = \\lim_{t \\to x} \\frac{f'(\u03be)}{g'(\u03be)} = \\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}\n     \\]\n   - This shows that the original limit is equal to the ratio of the derivatives at \\(x\\).\n\nIn summary, by leveraging the behavior of the functions near the point \\(x\\) and applying the Mean Value Theorem, we establish that the limit of the ratio \\(\\frac{f(t)}{g(t)}\\) as \\(t\\) approaches \\(x\\) is indeed equal to \\(\\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}\\), provided that the derivatives exist and \\(g'(x)\\) is non-zero.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

For most elements in \\( G \\), their inverse is distinct from themselves. That is, for such an element \\( g \\), we have \\( g \\neq g^{-1} \\).

The fact that \\( (ab)^n = a^n b^n \\) suggests that the commutator between \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) has a controlled behavior.\n\nTo delve deeper, let's expand \\( (ab)^n \\) using the binomial-like expansion that accounts for the non-commutativity:\n\\[\n(ab)^n = a^n b^n \\cdot (aba^{-1}b^{-1})^{\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}}\n\\]\nGiven our condition \\( (ab)^n = a^n b^n \\), it follows that:\n\\[\na^n b^n \\cdot (aba^{-1}b^{-1})^{\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}} = a^n b^n\n\\]\nFor this equation to hold, the additional factor involving the commutator must equal the identity:\n\\[\n(aba^{-1}b^{-1})^{\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}} = e\n\\]\nTo achieve our goal of showing \\( (aba^{-1}b^{-1})^{n(n-1)} = e \\), we can square both sides of the above equality:\n\\[\n\\left( (aba^{-1}b^{-1})^{\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}} \\right)^2 = e^2 \\implies (aba^{-1}b^{-1})^{n(n-1)} = e\n\\]\nThus, we have established that the commutator \\( aba^{-1}b^{-1} \\) raised to the power \\( n(n-1) \\) is indeed the identity element \\( e \\) in the group \\( G \\).\n\nThis conclusion follows directly from the given condition \\( (ab)^n = a^n b^n \\) and the properties of group commutators, completing the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  a ^ n * b ^ n\nG : Type u_1\ninst\u271d : Group G\nn : \u2115\nhn : n > 1\nh : \u2200 (a b : G), (a * b) ^ n = a ^ n * b ^ n\na b : G\nh1 : (a * b) ^ n = a ^ n * b ^ n\n\u22a2 (a * b * a\u207b\u00b9 * b\u207b\u00b9) ^ (n * (n - 1)) = 1\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  a ^ n * b ^ n\nG : Type u_1\ninst\u271d : Group G\nn : \u2115\nhn : n > 1\nh : \u2200 (a b : G), (a * b) ^ n = a ^ n * b ^ n\na b : G\nh1 : (a * b) ^ n = a ^ n * b ^ n\n\u22a2 (a * b * a\u207b\u00b9 * b\u207b\u00b9) ^ (n * (n - 1)) = 1\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  a ^ n * b ^ n\nG : Type u_1\ninst\u271d : Group G\nn : \u2115\nhn : n > 1\nh : \u2200 (a b : G), (a * b) ^ n = a ^ n * b ^ n\na b : G\nh1 : (a * b) ^ n = a ^ n * b ^ n\n\u22a2 (a * b * a\u207b\u00b9 * b\u207b\u00b9) ^ (n * (n - 1)) = 1\nPlease revise the proof.",

Our goal is to show that \\( G \\) must be a cyclic group of prime order.\n\nFirst, let's consider the order of \\( G \\), denoted by \\( |G| \\). Since \\( G \\) is a group, its order is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1. If \\( |G| = 1 \\), then \\( G \\) is the trivial group containing only the identity element. However, the trivial group does have a proper subgroup\u2014the subgroup consisting solely of the identity element itself. But our assumption is that \\( G \\) has no proper subgroups, so \\( |G| \\) cannot be 1. Therefore, \\( |G| \\) must be at least 2.\n\nNow, suppose \\( |G| \\) is not a prime number. If \\( |G| = mn \\) for some integers \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) where \\( 1 < m, n < |G| \\), then by Lagrange's Theorem, \\( G \\) would have a subgroup of order \\( m \\) and another of order \\( n \\). This contradicts our assumption that \\( G \\) has no proper subgroups. Therefore, the order of \\( G \\) must be a prime number, say \\( p \\).\n\nGiven that \\( |G| = p \\) and \\( p \\) is prime, we can apply the theorem from our context: any group of prime order is cyclic. To see why, take any element \\( a \\) in \\( G \\) that is not the identity element. Since the order of \\( G \\) is prime, the only possible orders for elements are 1 and \\( p \\). The identity element has order 1, so \\( a \\) must have order \\( p \\). This means that \\( a \\) generates the entire group \\( G \\), making \\( G \\) cyclic.\n\nIn conclusion, if a group \\( G \\) has no proper subgroups, its order must be a prime number, and \\( G \\) is cyclic of that prime order.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown constant 'IsCyclic.of_prime_card'\nunknown constant 'Fintype.exists_prime_card_eq'\nrcases tactic failed: x\u271d : ?m.481 is not an inductive datatype\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown constant 'IsCyclic.of_prime_card'\nunknown constant 'IsCyclic.of_prime_card'\nrcases tactic failed: x\u271d : ?m.500 is not an inductive datatype\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown constant 'IsCyclic.of_prime_card'\nunknown constant 'IsCyclic.card_prime_of_prime'\nrcases tactic failed: x\u271d : ?m.500 is not an inductive datatype\nPlease revise the proof.",

Since \\( \\langle a \\rangle \\) is a subgroup of \\( G \\) and all subgroups of \\( G \\) are normal by assumption, \\( \\langle a \\rangle \\) is a normal subgroup.

Let \\( H \\) be a subgroup of \\( G \\) with order \\( p^n \\). We aim to show that \\( H \\) is a characteristic subgroup of \\( G \\), meaning that any automorphism of \\( G \\) maps \\( H \\) to itself.\n\nFirst, observe that in any finite abelian group, the structure of the group can be decomposed into a direct product of its Sylow subgroups. Specifically, since \\( p \\) does not divide \\( m \\), the Sylow \\( p \\)-subgroup of \\( G \\) has order \\( p^n \\), and the Sylow \\( m \\)-subgroup has order \\( m \\). Because \\( G \\) is abelian, these Sylow subgroups are unique and thus normal. This uniqueness is crucial because it implies that there is only one subgroup of \\( G \\) with order \\( p^n \\), which is \\( H \\).\n\nNow, consider any automorphism \\( \\phi \\) of \\( G \\). Since automorphisms preserve the order of elements and the group structure, \\( \\phi \\) must map Sylow \\( p \\)-subgroups to Sylow \\( p \\)-subgroups. However, because the Sylow \\( p \\)-subgroup is unique in \\( G \\), \\( \\phi \\) cannot send \\( H \\) to a different subgroup of the same order\u2014it must map \\( H \\) to itself. This is because there are no other subgroups of \\( G \\) with order \\( p^n \\) to which \\( H \\) could be mapped.\n\nTherefore, \\( H \\) is preserved under all automorphisms of \\( G \\), making it a characteristic subgroup. In other words, \\( H \\) is uniquely determined by its properties within \\( G \\), and no automorphism can alter it without changing the group\u2019s structure. This uniqueness and preservation under automorphisms satisfy the definition of a characteristic subgroup.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  Fintype \u21a5K\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to rewrite using equation theorems for 'IsPGroup'\nfailed to rewrite using equation theorems for 'IsPGroup'\nunknown constant 'Sylow.eq_of_card_eq'\ninvalid field notation, type is not of the form (C ...) where C is a constant\n  Subgroup.Characteristic\nhas type\n  Subgroup ?m.6251 \u2192 Prop\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: invalid field notation, type is not of the form (C ...) where C is a constant\n  Subgroup.Characteristic\nhas type\n  Subgroup ?m.816 \u2192 Prop\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  Fintype (G \u29f8 \u03c6.ker)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  card ?m.10026 = card ?m.10027\nG : Type u_1\ninst\u271d\u00b2 : CommGroup G\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : Fintype G\np m n : \u2115\nhp : p.Prime\nhp1 : \u00acp \u2223 m\nhG : card G = p ^ n * m\nH : Subgroup G\ninst\u271d : Fintype \u21a5H\nhH : card \u21a5H = p ^ n\n\u03c6 : G \u2192* G\n\u22a2 sorryAx \u2115 true = card G\nfailed to synthesize\n  Fintype (G \u29f8 \u03c6.ker)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  Fintype \u21a5\u03c6.ker\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nunknown constant 'Fintype.card_quotient_ker_eq_card_quotient_mk'\nfailed to synthesize\n  Fintype \u21a5\u03c6.ker\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  Fintype \u21a5\u03c6.ker\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nunknown constant 'Nat.prime_of_prime'\nunknown constant 'Nat.prime_of_prime'\nunknown constant 'Subgroup.Characteristic_of_ker_le'\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "# Informal Proof:\n\nTo prove that every group of order\u202f9 is abelian, let's consider the structure of such a group.\n\nFirst, observe that 9 is a prime power, specifically \\(9 = 3^2\\). In group theory, groups whose order is a power of a prime number often have specific structural properties. One key property for groups of prime-squared order is that they are abelian.\n\nLet's delve into why this is the case:\n\n1. **Center of the Group**: For any finite group \\(G\\), the center \\(Z(G)\\) (which consists of all elements that commute with every other element in \\(G\\)) is always a non-trivial subgroup when the order of \\(G\\) is \\(p^2\\), where \\(p\\) is a prime. In our case, since \\(G\\) has order \\(9 = 3^2\\), the center \\(Z(G)\\) must have order either \\(3\\) or \\(9\\).\n\n2. **Possibility of the Center being the Whole Group**: If \\(Z(G)\\) has order \\(9\\), then \\(Z(G) = G\\), which means every element commutes with every other element in \\(G\\). This directly implies that \\(G\\) is abelian.\n\n3. **If the Center has Order 3**: Suppose \\(Z(G)\\) has order \\(3\\). Then, the quotient group \\(G/Z(G)\\) would have order \\(9 / 3 = 3\\), which is a prime order. Groups of prime order are cyclic and, importantly, abelian. However, having a non-trivial center often leads to the entire group being abelian, especially in small groups like those of order \\(9\\).\n\n4. **Conclusion from Structure**: Whether the center \\(Z(G)\\) is the entire group or a subgroup of order \\(3\\), the group \\(G\\) exhibits properties that enforce commutativity among its elements. Specifically, if the center is smaller, the quotient group being cyclic helps in establishing that the original group must still be abelian to maintain consistency in its structure.\n\nTherefore, in both scenarios, the group \\(G\\) of order \\(9\\) must be abelian. There are no non-abelian groups of order \\(9\\), ensuring that all such groups are commutative.\nPrevious attempt failed with: expected ';' or line break\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: expected ';' or line break\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: expected ';' or line break\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

Our goal is to show that \\( \\varphi(y) = y^{-1} \\) holds for every element \\( y \\) in \\( G \\), and consequently, that \\( G \\) is abelian.\n\nFirst, recall that an automorphism is a bijective map from the group to itself that preserves the group operation. Given that \\( \\varphi \\) is such an automorphism, it inherently respects the structure of \\( G \\).\n\nNow, consider the set of elements in \\( G \\) for which \\( \\varphi(x) = x^{-1} \\). By assumption, this set comprises more than three-fourths of all elements in \\( G \\). Since \\( G \\) is finite, the complement of this set\u2014the elements for which \\( \\varphi(x) \\neq x^{-1} \\)\u2014must, therefore, consist of fewer than one-fourth of the group's elements.\n\nNext, observe that applying \\( \\varphi \\) twice to any element \\( x \\) yields:\n\\[\n\\varphi(\\varphi(x)) = \\varphi(x^{-1}) = (\\varphi(x))^{-1}\n\\]\nIf \\( \\varphi(x) = x^{-1} \\), then:\n\\[\n\\varphi(\\varphi(x)) = \\varphi(x^{-1}) = (x^{-1})^{-1} = x\n\\]\nThis shows that \\( \\varphi \\) is an involution on the subset of elements where \\( \\varphi(x) = x^{-1} \\).\n\nNow, suppose for contradiction that there exists at least one element \\( y \\in G \\) such that \\( \\varphi(y) \\neq y^{-1} \\). Since \\( \\varphi \\) is a bijection, there must also be an element \\( z \\in G \\) for which \\( \\varphi(z) = y \\). Applying \\( \\varphi \\) to both sides gives \\( \\varphi(\\varphi(z)) = \\varphi(y) \\). From our earlier observation, if \\( z \\) is in the majority set where \\( \\varphi(z) = z^{-1} \\), then \\( \\varphi(\\varphi(z)) = z \\), leading to \\( z = \\varphi(y) \\). But since \\( \\varphi(y) \\neq y^{-1} \\), this creates a contradiction unless our assumption is false.\n\nTherefore, no such \\( y \\) can exist where \\( \\varphi(y) \\neq y^{-1} \\). This means \\( \\varphi(y) = y^{-1} \\) must hold for every element \\( y \\) in \\( G \\).\n\nFinally, consider how \\( \\varphi \\) interacts with the group operation.

Therefore, \\( G \\) is abelian.\n\nIn summary, under the given conditions, the automorphism \\( \\varphi \\) must invert every element of \\( G \\), and this inversion property ensures that all

We need to show that this set is a normal subgroup of \\( G' \\).\n\n3. **Normality Condition**:\n   - For \\( \\varphi(N) \\) to be normal in \\( G' \\), it must satisfy the condition that for any element \\( g' \\) in \\( G' \\) and any element \\( n' \\) in \\( \\varphi(N) \\), the conjugate \\( g' n' g'^{-1} \\) also belongs to \\( \\varphi(N) \\).\n\n4. **Leveraging Surjectivity of \\( \\varphi \\)**:\n   - Since \\( \\varphi \\) is onto, for any \\( g' \\) in \\( G' \\), there exists some \\( g \\) in \\( G \\) such that \\( \\varphi(g) = g' \\).\n   - Similarly, for any \\( n' \\) in \\( \\varphi(N) \\), there exists some \\( n \\) in \\( N \\) with \\( \\varphi(n) = n' \\).\n\n5. **Conjugation in \\( G' \\)**:\n   - Consider the conjugate \\( g' n' g'^{-1} \\).

Our goal is to show that \\( G \\) and \\( H \\) are isomorphic, meaning they have the same group structure.\n\nFirst, recall that by the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow \\( p \\)-subgroups in a group of order \\( pq \\) must divide \\( q \\) and be congruent to 1 modulo \\( p \\). Given that \\( q \\) is a prime smaller than \\( p \\), the only number satisfying these conditions is 1. This means both \\( G \\) and \\( H \\) have a unique Sylow \\( p \\)-subgroup, say \\( P_G \\) in \\( G \\) and \\( P_H \\) in \\( H \\). Similarly, there must be one Sylow \\( q \\)-subgroup in each, denoted \\( Q_G \\) and \\( Q_H \\) respectively.\n\nSince there is only one Sylow \\( p \\)-subgroup in each group, these subgroups must be normal. This is because in a group, a Sylow subgroup that is unique must be invariant under conjugation by any element of the group, making it a normal subgroup.\n\nNow, both \\( G \\) and \\( H \\) can be viewed as extensions of their Sylow \\( p \\)-subgroups by their Sylow \\( q \\)-subgroups. Specifically, each group is a semidirect product of \\( P \\) and \\( Q \\), where \\( Q \\) acts on \\( P \\) via automorphisms. The crucial point here is that the number of possible distinct actions (and hence distinct group structures) is determined by the homomorphism from \\( Q \\) to the automorphism group of \\( P \\).\n\nGiven that \\( q \\) divides \\( p - 1 \\), there exists a nontrivial homomorphism from \\( Q \\) to the automorphism group of \\( P \\), enabling the construction of a nonabelian semidirect product. Importantly, the condition that \\( q \\) divides \\( p - 1 \\) ensures that this action is unique up to isomorphism. This uniqueness implies that the way \\( Q \\) interacts with \\( P \\) is the same in both \\( G \\) and \\( H \\).\n\nSince both \\( G \\) and \\( H \\) are built from their Sylow subgroups in the same way, the resulting group structures must be identical. Therefore, there exists an isomorphism between \\( G \\) and \\( H \\), proving that any two nonabelian groups of order \\( pq \\) under the given conditions are indeed isomorphic.\nPrevious attempt failed with: \nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: \nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: \nPlease revise the proof.",

We aim to show that the intersection of \\( A \\) and the cyclic subgroup generated by \\( b \\), denoted \\( (b) \\), contains only the identity element, formally \\( A \\cap (b) = \\{e\\} \\).\n\nFirst, observe that \\( (b) \\) is the set \\(\\{e, b, b^2, \\ldots, b^{p-1}\\}\\), forming a cyclic subgroup of \\( G \\) with exactly \\( p \\) distinct elements because \\( b \\) has order \\( p \\). \n\nThe intersection \\( A \\cap (b) \\) consists of all elements that are both in \\( A \\) and in \\( (b) \\). Since \\( A \\) is a subgroup of \\( G \\), any element in \\( A \\cap (b) \\) must satisfy the subgroup properties within both \\( A \\) and \\( (b) \\).\n\nBecause \\( (b) \\) is cyclic of prime order \\( p \\), its only subgroups are the trivial subgroup \\( \\{e\\} \\) and \\( (b) \\) itself.

Our goal is to show that for any automorphism \\( \\varphi \\) of \\( G \\), the image of \\( P \\) under \\( \\varphi \\) is still \\( P \\) itself, that is, \\( \\varphi(P) = P \\).\n\nFirst, recall that a \\( p \\)-Sylow subgroup of a group \\( G \\) is a maximal subgroup of \\( G \\) whose order is a power of the prime \\( p \\). The Sylow theorems tell us several important properties about these subgroups. One key property is that all \\( p \\)-Sylow subgroups of \\( G \\) are conjugate to each other, meaning they are all structurally similar but possibly located in different parts of the group.\n\nHowever, in our case, \\( P \\) is not just any \\( p \\)-Sylow subgroup; it is a **normal** \\( p \\)-Sylow subgroup. Normality here means that \\( P \\) is invariant under conjugation by any element of \\( G \\). In other words, for every \\( g \\) in \\( G \\), the conjugate \\( gPg^{-1} = P \\). This invariance implies that \\( P \\) is the **unique** \\( p \\)-Sylow subgroup of \\( G \\). If there were another \\( p \\)-Sylow subgroup, it would have to be a conjugate of \\( P \\), but since \\( P \\) is normal, it must be equal to all its conjugates, leaving no room for distinct \\( p \\)-Sylow subgroups.\n\nNow, consider an automorphism \\( \\varphi \\) of \\( G \\). An automorphism is a bijective map from \\( G \\) to itself that preserves the group structure. Automorphisms inherently preserve the order of elements and the structure of subgroups. Specifically, \\( \\varphi \\) will map \\( p \\)-Sylow subgroups to \\( p \\)-Sylow subgroups because it preserves the order of elements and the maximality condition defining Sylow subgroups.\n\nSince \\( P \\) is the **unique** \\( p \\)-Sylow subgroup of \\( G \\), the image \\( \\varphi(P) \\) must also be a \\( p \\)-Sylow subgroup of \\( G \\). But the only \\( p \\)-Sylow subgroup available is \\( P \\) itself. Therefore, \\( \\varphi(P) \\) cannot be anything other than \\( P \\).\n\nIn conclusion, because \\( P \\) is the unique normal \\( p \\)-Sylow subgroup of \\( G \\), any automorphism \\( \\varphi \\) of \\( G \\) must map \\( P \\) to itself.

This means that the set of elements that \u03c3 moves and the set that \u03c4 moves are entirely separate; there is no overlap in the elements affected by \u03c3 and \u03c4.\n\nGiven that \u03c3 and \u03c4 do not disturb any common elements, an important property we can invoke is that \u03c3 and \u03c4 commute. In other words, applying \u03c3 followed by \u03c4 is the same as applying \u03c4 followed by \u03c3. This is derived from the fact that their actions are on distinct parts of the set, so the order in which you apply them doesn't matter.\n\nNow, suppose that the composition of \u03c3 and \u03c4 equals the identity permutation \\( e \\), which does nothing to any element in the set. Symbolically, this is written as:\n\\[\n\\sigma \\tau = e\n\\]\nSince \u03c3 and \u03c4 commute, we can also write:\n\\[\n\\tau \\sigma = e\n\\]\nFrom the equation \\( \\sigma \\tau = e \\), we can deduce that \u03c4 must be the inverse of \u03c3. That is:\n\\[\n\\tau = \\sigma^{-1}\n\\]\nHowever, remember that \u03c3 and \u03c4 disturb disjoint sets of elements. The inverse of a permutation has the same set of elements it moves as the original permutation. Therefore, \u03c3 and \\( \\sigma^{-1} \\) have overlapping supports\u2014the elements they move\u2014which contradicts our initial assumption that \u03c3 and \u03c4 disturb no common elements.\n\nThe only way to resolve this contradiction is if \u03c3 and \u03c4 do not disturb any elements at all. In other words, both \u03c3 and \u03c4 must be the identity permutation \\( e \\), which leaves every element fixed.

Calculating, there are exactly 6 such invertible matrices.\n\nOn the other hand, \\( S_3 \\), the symmetric group on three letters, consists of all possible permutations of three elements. It has exactly 6 elements: the identity permutation, three transpositions (swapping two elements), and two 3-cycles (rotating all three elements).\n\n**2. Matching Orders and Structures:**\n\nBoth \\( T \\) and \\( S_3 \\) have the same order, which is 6. Additionally, both groups are non-abelian, meaning that the order in which you perform operations matters. The non-abelian nature of both groups suggests a deeper structural similarity beyond just having the same number of elements.\n\n**3. Establishing a Correspondence Between Elements:**\n\nTo construct an isomorphism, we aim to pair each element of \\( T \\) with a unique element of \\( S_3 \\) in a way that preserves the group operation (matrix multiplication in \\( T \\) corresponds to permutation composition in \\( S_3 \\)). Here's how we can align them:\n\n- **Identity Elements:** The identity matrix in \\( T \\), which leaves vectors unchanged, corresponds to the identity permutation in \\( S_3 \\).\n  \n- **Transpositions and Reflections:** The matrices in \\( T \\) that swap two basis vectors (akin to transpositions) can be paired with the three transpositions in \\( S_3 \\). These matrices perform operations similar to reflections in the dihedral group \\( D_3 \\), which is known to be isomorphic to \\( S_3 \\).\n\n- **3-Cycles and Rotations:** The remaining two matrices in \\( T \\) that cyclically permute the basis vectors resemble the 3-cycles in \\( S_3 \\). These operations are analogous to the rotations in \\( D_3 \\).\n\n**4. Preserving the Group Operation:**\n\nBy aligning the elements as described, the multiplication of matrices in \\( T \\) mirrors the composition of permutations in \\( S_3 \\). For instance, multiplying two reflection-like matrices in \\( T \\) results in a rotation-like matrix, just as composing two transpositions in \\( S_3 \\) results in a 3-cycle. This one-to-one correspondence ensures that the group operations are preserved under the mapping.\n\n**5. Conclusion:**\n\nSince there exists a bijective correspondence between the elements of \\( T \\) and \\( S_3 \\) that preserves the group operations, we conclude that \\( T \\) is isomorphic to \\( S_3 \\). This means that, in essence, these two groups have identical algebraic structures despite being defined in different mathematical contexts.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unexpected identifier; expected '}'\nfailed to synthesize\n  Mul S3\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unexpected token ','; expected '}'\nfailed to synthesize\n  Mul S3\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nPlease revise the proof.",

We want to show that exactly half of the numbers from \\( 1 \\) to \\( p-1 \\) are quadratic residues modulo \\( p \\), and the other half are quadratic nonresidues.\n\n**Understanding Quadratic Residues:**\nA number \\( a \\) is called a *quadratic residue* modulo \\( p \\) if there exists some integer \\( x \\) such that \\( x^2 \\equiv a \\pmod{p} \\). If no such \\( x \\) exists, then \\( a \\) is a *quadratic nonresidue* modulo \\( p \\). Our goal is to count how many residues and nonresidues there are among the numbers \\( 1, 2, \\ldots, p-1 \\).\n\n**Squaring the Numbers:**\nFirst, consider the squares of all numbers from \\( 1 \\) to \\( p-1 \\) modulo \\( p \\). That is, compute \\( 1^2, 2^2, 3^2, \\ldots, (p-1)^2 \\) each reduced modulo \\( p \\).\n\n**Symmetry in Squares:**\nNotice that squaring is symmetric around \\( \\frac{p}{2} \\). Specifically, for any number \\( r \\) between \\( 1 \\) and \\( \\frac{p-1}{2} \\), its negative counterpart modulo \\( p \\) is \\( p - r \\). When we square both \\( r \\) and \\( p - r \\), we get:\n\\[\nr^2 \\equiv (p - r)^2 \\pmod{p}\n\\]\nThis means each square \\( r^2 \\) is equal to \\( (p - r)^2 \\) modulo \\( p \\), forming pairs of identical residues.\n\n**Counting Unique Residues:**\nSince there are \\( p - 1 \\) numbers from \\( 1 \\) to \\( p - 1 \\), and each pair \\( r \\) and \\( p - r \\) yields the same square, the total number of distinct quadratic residues is \\( \\frac{p - 1}{2} \\).\n\n**Ensuring Distinctness:**\nIt's crucial to verify that these \\( \\frac{p - 1}{2} \\) squared numbers are all different modulo \\( p \\). Suppose, for contradiction, that two different numbers \\( r \\) and \\( s \\) within \\( 1 \\) to \\( \\frac{p - 1}{2} \\) have the same square modulo \\( p \\):\n\\[\nr^2 \\equiv s^2 \\pmod{p}\n\\]\nThis implies:\n\\[\np \\text{ divides } (r^2 - s^2) = (r + s)(r - s)\n\\]\nSince \\( p \\) is prime, it must divide one of the factors. However, \\( r + s \\) is at least \\( 2 \\) and at most \\( p - 1 \\), so \\( p \\) cannot divide \\( r + s \\). Therefore, \\( p \\) must divide \\( r - s \\). But \\( r \\) and \\( s \\) are both between \\( 1 \\) and \\( \\frac{p - 1}{2} \\), making \\( r - s \\) smaller than \\( p \\) in absolute value. The only possibility is that \\( r - s = 0 \\), meaning \\( r = s \\). This contradiction shows that all the \\( \\frac{p - 1}{2} \\) quadratic residues are indeed distinct.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nSince there are exactly \\( \\frac{p - 1}{2} \\) distinct quadratic residues and there are \\( p - 1 \\) numbers in total, the remaining \\( \\frac{p - 1}{2} \\) numbers must be quadratic nonresidues.

Isomorphism of the Fields \\( F[x]/(p(x)) \\) and \\( F[x]/(q(x)) \\):\n\nThe quotient \\( F[x]/(f(x)) \\) where \\( f(x) \\) is an irreducible polynomial over \\( F \\), forms a field extension of \\( F \\). Specifically, since both \\( p(x) \\) and \\( q(x) \\) are irreducible of degree 3, the resulting fields \\( F[x]/(p(x)) \\) and \\( F[x]/(q(x)) \\) are both extensions of \\( \\mathbb{Z}_7 \\) of degree 3.\n\n**a. Properties of Finite Fields:**\n\nA fundamental property of finite fields is that for each prime power \\( q = p^n \\), there exists, up to isomorphism, exactly one finite field of order \\( q \\). Since both \\( F[x]/(p(x)) \\) and \\( F[x]/(q(x)) \\) are extensions of \\( \\mathbb{Z}_7 \\) of degree 3, they each have:\n\\[\n7^3 = 343 \\quad \\text{elements}.\n\\]\n\n**b. Conclusion on Isomorphism:**\n\nGiven that there is only one field of order 343 up to isomorphism, it follows that \\( F[x]/(p(x)) \\) and \\( F[x]/(q(x)) \\) must be isomorphic to each other. This means there exists a bijective field homomorphism between them that preserves both addition and multiplication.\n\n**Alternative Reasoning:**\n\nAdditionally, since both \\( p(x) \\) and \\( q(x) \\) are irreducible and of the same degree over \\( \\mathbb{Z}_7 \\), any two such quotient fields are generated by roots of these polynomials and hence share the same algebraic structure. This structural similarity ensures that the fields are indeed isomorphic.\n\n### Final Conclusion:\n\nBoth polynomials \\( p(x) = x^3 - 2 \\) and \\( q(x) = x^3 + 2 \\) are irreducible in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_7[x] \\).

This theorem provides a method to identify all possible rational roots of a polynomial, which is a crucial first step in determining whether the polynomial can be factored into lower-degree polynomials with rational coefficients.\n\n**Step 1: Apply the Rational Root Theorem**\n\nThe Rational Root Theorem states that any possible rational root \\( \\frac{p}{q} \\) of the polynomial \\( f(x) \\), where \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) are integers with no common factors other than 1 (i.e., the fraction is in lowest terms), must satisfy:\n- \\( p \\) divides the constant term of the polynomial.\n- \\( q \\) divides the leading coefficient of the polynomial.\n\nFor \\( f(x) = x^3 + 3x + 2 \\):\n- The constant term is **2**.\n- The leading coefficient is **1**.\n\nTherefore, the possible values for \\( p \\) are the divisors of 2: \\( \\pm1, \\pm2 \\).\nSince the leading coefficient is 1, the possible values for \\( q \\) are \\( \\pm1 \\).\n\nThis means the **only possible rational roots** are \\( \\pm1 \\) and \\( \\pm2 \\).\n\n**Step 2: Test the Possible Rational Roots**\n\nWe substitute each potential root into the polynomial to see if it yields zero.\n\n1. **Testing \\( x = 1 \\):**\n   \\[\n   f(1) = (1)^3 + 3(1) + 2 = 1 + 3 + 2 = 6 \\neq 0\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Testing \\( x = -1 \\):**\n   \\[\n   f(-1) = (-1)^3 + 3(-1) + 2 = -1 - 3 + 2 = -2 \\neq 0\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Testing \\( x = 2 \\):**\n   \\[\n   f(2) = (2)^3 + 3(2) + 2 = 8 + 6 + 2 = 16 \\neq 0\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Testing \\( x = -2 \\):**\n   \\[\n   f(-2) = (-2)^3 + 3(-2) + 2 = -8 - 6 + 2 = -12 \\neq 0\n   \\]\n\n**Step 3: Conclude Irreducibility**\n\nSince none of the possible rational roots satisfy \\( f(x) = 0 \\), the polynomial \\( f(x) \\) does not have any linear factors with rational coefficients.

Therefore, \\( \\binom{p^n}{k} \\) is divisible by \\( p \\), meaning \\( \\binom{p^n}{k} \\equiv 0 \\) in the field \\( F \\) (because \\( p \\cdot 1_F = 0_F \\)).\n\n**Simplifying the Expansion:**\nGiven that all middle coefficients are zero in \\( F \\), the binomial expansion simplifies to:\n\\[\n(a + b)^{p^n} = \\binom{p^n}{0} a^{p^n} b^{0} + \\sum_{k=1}^{p^n - 1} \\binom{p^n}{k} a^{p^n - k} b^{k} + \\binom{p^n}{p^n} a^{0} b^{p^n}\n\\]\n\\[\n= a^{p^n} + 0 + b^{p^n}\n\\]\n\\[\n= a^{p^n} + b^{p^n}\n\\]\nHence, we have:\n\\[\n(a + b)^{m} = a^{m} + b^{m}\n\\]\nwhere \\( m = p^n \\).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy expanding \\((a + b)^m\\) using the Binomial Theorem and leveraging the property of the field's characteristic \\( p \\), we observe that all intermediate terms in the expansion vanish. This leaves us with \\((a + b)^m = a^m + b^m\\), as required. Therefore, the equation holds for all \\( a, b \\in F \\) and for any positive integer \\( n \\) with \\( m = p^n \\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  ?a ^ (?n + 1)\ncase succ\np m : \u2115\nF : Type u_1\ninst\u271d : Field F\nhp : p.Prime\nhF : CharP F p\na b : F\nn : \u2115\nih : m = p ^ n \u2192 (a + b) ^ p ^ n = a ^ p ^ n + b ^ p ^ n\nhm : m = p ^ (n + 1)\n\u22a2 (a + b) ^ (p ^ n * p) = a ^ (p ^ n * p) + b ^ (p ^ n * p)\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  ?a ^ (?n + 1)\ncase succ\np m : \u2115\nF : Type u_1\ninst\u271d : Field F\nhp : p.Prime\nhF : CharP F p\na b : F\nn : \u2115\nih : m = p ^ n \u2192 (a + b) ^ m = a ^ m + b ^ m\nhm : m = p ^ (n + 1)\n\u22a2 (a + b) ^ (p ^ n * p) = a ^ (p ^ n * p) + b ^ (p ^ n * p)\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  ?a ^ (?n + 1)\ncase succ\np m : \u2115\nF : Type u_1\ninst\u271d : Field F\nhp : p.Prime\nhF : CharP F p\na b : F\nn : \u2115\nih : m = p ^ n \u2192 (a + b) ^ m = a ^ m + b ^ m\nhm : m = p ^ (n + 1)\n\u22a2 (a + b) ^ (p ^ n * p) = a ^ (p ^ n * p) + b ^ (p ^ n * p)\nPlease revise the proof.",

We want to determine whether this polynomial has any repeated roots in the field \\( F \\). A key tool for this analysis is the concept of the derivative of a polynomial. In general, if a polynomial and its derivative share a common root, that root is a repeated (or multiple) root.\n\nLet's compute the derivative of \\( f(x) \\):\n\\[\nf'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(x^{p^n}) - \\frac{d}{dx}(x) = p^n x^{p^n - 1} - 1.\n\\]\nHowever, since the field \\( F \\) has characteristic \\( p \\), any coefficient that is a multiple of \\( p \\) is equivalent to zero in \\( F \\).

However, since \\( f'(x) = -1 \\) does not equal zero for any \\( x \\) in \\( F \\), there can be no such repeated roots.\n\nTherefore, every root of \\( f(x) = x^{p^n} - x \\) in the field \\( F \\) must be simple, meaning all roots are distinct.

This function measures how \"far apart\" these two points are within the metric space \\( M \\).\n\n2. **Defining the Distance Between Sets:**\n   \n   When dealing with entire sets rather than individual points, we define the distance between \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) as:\n   \\[\n   d(A, B) = \\inf \\{ d(a, b) \\mid a \\in A, \\, b \\in B \\}\n   \\]\n   This represents the greatest lower bound of all possible distances between points in \\( A \\) and points in \\( B \\).\n\n3. **Properties of \\( A \\) and \\( B \\):**\n   \n   Given that both \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are **compact** and **disjoint**, several important properties come into play:\n   - **Compactness** in a metric space ensures that every sequence within \\( A \\) or \\( B \\) has a subsequence that converges to a point within the same set.

This continuity is crucial because it allows us to apply the Extreme Value Theorem.\n\n5. **Applying the Extreme Value Theorem:**\n   \n   The Extreme Value Theorem tells us that a continuous function on a compact set attains its minimum and maximum values. Since \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are compact, their Cartesian product \\( A \\times B \\) is also compact.

Therefore, the intersection must contain at least one point. In other words:\n\\[\n\\bigcap_{n=1}^\\infty V_n \\neq \\emptyset\n\\]\nThis concludes that in a compact space, the intersection of any nested sequence of non-empty closed subsets is indeed non-empty.\nPrevious attempt failed with: type mismatch\n  hs\nhas type\n  \u2200 (i : \u2115), s i \u2283 s (i + 1) : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u2200 (i : \u2115), IsCompact (s i) : Prop\ntype mismatch\n  hs\nhas type\n  \u2200 (i : \u2115), s i \u2283 s (i + 1) : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u2200 (i : \u2115), (s i).Nonempty : Prop\nunknown identifier 'isCompact_iInter'\ntype mismatch\n  h\nhas type\n  S = \u2205 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u2200 x \u2208 s 0, \u2203 i, x \u2209 s i : Prop\nfunction expected at\n  h2 0\nterm has type\n  (s 0).Nonempty\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

For any \\( t \\) near \\( x_0 \\), the inequality becomes\n\\[\n|f(t) - f(x_0)| \\leq |t - x_0|^2.\n\\]\nAs \\( t \\) approaches \\( x_0 \\), the right-hand side \\( |t - x_0|^2 \\) approaches zero much faster than \\( |t - x_0| \\). This rapid decrease implies that \\( f(t) \\) gets exceedingly close to \\( f(x_0) \\) as \\( t \\) approaches \\( x_0 \\). In other words, there's virtually no change in the value of \\( f \\) around \\( x_0 \\).\n\nSince \\( x_0 \\) was an arbitrary point in \\( \\mathbb{R} \\), this behavior must hold true for every point in the real line. If \\( f \\) were not constant, there would exist at least two points where \\( f \\) takes different values. However, between these two points, we could choose points sufficiently close to each other where the inequality \\( |f(t) - f(x)| \\leq |t - x|^2 \\) would be violated because the left-hand side would be a positive constant (the difference in function values) while the right-hand side could be made arbitrarily small.\n\nTherefore, the only way to satisfy the given condition for all points in \\( \\mathbb{R} \\) is for \\( f \\) to assign the same value to every input.

In other words, \\( Z(G) = \\{ z \\in G \\mid zg = gz \\text{ for all } g \\in G \\} \\).\n\n2. **Direct Product of Groups:** The direct product \\( G \\times H \\) is the set of ordered pairs \\( (g, h) \\) where \\( g \\in G \\) and \\( h \\in H \\), equipped with group operation defined component-wise: \\( (g_1, h_1) \\cdot (g_2, h_2) = (g_1g_2, h_1h_2) \\).\n\n**Proof Steps:**\n\n1. **Elements of the Center of \\( G \\times H \\):** Consider an arbitrary element \\( (z, w) \\) in \\( G \\times H \\). We want to determine when \\( (z, w) \\) belongs to the center of \\( G \\times H \\), denoted \\( Z(G \\times H) \\).\n\n2. **Commuting with All Elements:**\n   - For \\( (z, w) \\) to be in \\( Z(G \\times H) \\), it must commute with every element \\( (x, y) \\) in \\( G \\times H \\).\n   - Compute the product in both orders:\n     - \\( (x, y) \\cdot (z, w) = (xz, yw) \\)\n     - \\( (z, w) \\cdot (x, y) = (zx, wy) \\)\n   - For these to be equal for all \\( (x, y) \\), we must have:\n     - \\( xz = zx \\) in \\( G \\), and\n     - \\( yw = wy \\) in \\( H \\).\n\n3. **Implications for \\( z \\) and \\( w \\):**\n   - The equation \\( xz = zx \\) for all \\( x \\in G \\) implies that \\( z \\) is in the center of \\( G \\), i.e., \\( z \\in Z(G) \\).\n   - Similarly, \\( yw = wy \\) for all \\( y \\in H \\) implies that \\( w \\) is in the center of \\( H \\), i.e., \\( w \\in Z(H) \\).\n\n4. **Conclusion for the Direct Product:**\n   - Therefore, any element \\( (z, w) \\) in \\( Z(G \\times H) \\) must satisfy \\( z \\in Z(G) \\) and \\( w \\in Z(H) \\).\n   - This means \\( Z(G \\times H) \\subseteq Z(G) \\times Z(H) \\).\n\n5. **Conversely, Elements in \\( Z(G) \\times Z(H) \\):**\n   - Take any element \\( (z, w) \\) in \\( Z(G) \\times Z(H) \\). By definition, \\( z \\) commutes with every element in \\( G \\) and \\( w \\) commutes with every element in \\( H \\).\n   - Therefore, for any \\( (x, y) \\in G \\times H \\):\n     - \\( (x, y) \\cdot (z, w) = (xz, yw) = (zx, wy) = (z, w) \\cdot (x, y) \\).\n   - This shows that \\( (z, w) \\) commutes with all elements in \\( G \\times H \\), hence \\( (z, w) \\in Z(G \\times H) \\).\n   - Therefore, \\( Z(G) \\times Z(H) \\subseteq Z(G \\times H) \\).\n\n6. **Final Conclusion:**\n   - Since we've established both \\( Z(G \\times H) \\subseteq Z(G) \\times Z(H) \\) and \\( Z(G) \\times Z(H) \\subseteq Z(G \\times H) \\), it follows that:\n     \\[\n     Z(G \\times H) = Z(G) \\times Z(H)\n     \\]\n   - Thus, the center of the direct product of two groups is precisely the direct product of their centers.\nPrevious attempt failed with: function expected at\n  (\u2191z).2\nterm has type\n  H\nfunction expected at\n  (\u2191z).2\nterm has type\n  H\napplication type mismatch\n  \u27e8(\u2191p.1, \u2191p.2), fun g h => ?m.1865 g h\u27e9\nargument\n  fun g h => ?m.1865 g h\nhas type\n  (g : ?m.1855) \u2192 (h : ?m.1863 g) \u2192 ?m.1864 g h : Sort (imax ?u.1854 ?u.1857 ?u.1860)\nbut is expected to have type\n  (\u2191p.1, \u2191p.2) \u2208 center (G \u00d7 H) : Prop\ninvalid constructor \u27e8...\u27e9, expected type must be an inductive type \n  ?m.1864 g h\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  \u27e8(\u2191z).1, (\u2191z).2\u27e9\nargument\n  (\u2191z).2\nhas type\n  H : Type u_2\nbut is expected to have type\n  (\u2191z).1 \u2208 center G : Prop\napplication type mismatch\n  Subtype.mk \u22ef\nargument\n  z.property.comm\nhas type\n  \u2200 (a : G \u00d7 H), \u2191z * a = a * \u2191z : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  H : Type u_2\ninvalid constructor \u27e8...\u27e9, insufficient number of arguments, constructs 'IsMulCentral.mk' has #4 explicit fields, but only #2 provided\nunsolved goals\ncase a.a\nG : Type u_1\nH : Type u_2\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : Group G\ninst\u271d : Group H\nz : \u21a5(center (G \u00d7 H))\n\u22a2 sorryAx H true = (\u2191z).2\nunsolved goals\ncase a.a\nG : Type u_1\nH : Type u_2\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : Group G\ninst\u271d : Group H\np : \u21a5(center G) \u00d7 \u21a5(center H)\n\u22a2 sorryAx H true = \u2191p.2\nunsolved goals\ncase a.a\nG : Type u_1\nH : Type u_2\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : Group G\ninst\u271d : Group H\nz1 z2 : \u21a5(center (G \u00d7 H))\n\u22a2 sorryAx H true = 1\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  \u27e8(\u2191z).1, (\u2191z).2\u27e9\nargument\n  (\u2191z).2\nhas type\n  H : Type u_2\nbut is expected to have type\n  (\u2191z).1 \u2208 center G : Prop\napplication type mismatch\n  Subtype.mk \u22ef\nargument\n  z.property.comm\nhas type\n  \u2200 (a : G \u00d7 H), \u2191z * a = a * \u2191z : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  H : Type u_2\ninvalid constructor \u27e8...\u27e9, insufficient number of arguments, constructs 'IsMulCentral.mk' has #4 explicit fields, but only #2 provided\nunsolved goals\ncase a.a\nG : Type u_1\nH : Type u_2\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : Group G\ninst\u271d : Group H\nz : \u21a5(center (G \u00d7 H))\n\u22a2 sorryAx H true = (\u2191z).2\nunsolved goals\ncase a.a\nG : Type u_1\nH : Type u_2\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : Group G\ninst\u271d : Group H\np : \u21a5(center G) \u00d7 \u21a5(center H)\n\u22a2 sorryAx H true = \u2191p.2\nunsolved goals\ncase a.a\nG : Type u_1\nH : Type u_2\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : Group G\ninst\u271d : Group H\nz1 z2 : \u21a5(center (G \u00d7 H))\n\u22a2 sorryAx H true = 1\nPlease revise the proof.",

A field homomorphism is a function between two fields that preserves both addition and multiplication operations. Specifically, if \\( \\phi: F \\rightarrow K \\) is a homomorphism between fields \\( F \\) and \\( K \\), then for all elements \\( a, b \\) in \\( F \\):\n\n1. \\( \\phi(a + b) = \\phi(a) + \\phi(b) \\)\n2. \\( \\phi(a \\cdot b) = \\phi(a) \\cdot \\phi(b) \\)\n3. \\( \\phi(1_F) = 1_K \\) (where \\( 1_F \\) and \\( 1_K \\) are the multiplicative identities in \\( F \\) and \\( K \\), respectively)\n\nNow, to establish that \\( \\phi \\) is injective (one-to-one), we need to show that if \\( \\phi(a) = \\phi(b) \\), then \\( a = b \\). Alternatively, we can demonstrate that the only element that maps to zero in \\( K \\) is zero in \\( F \\).\n\nConsider the kernel of \\( \\phi \\), which is the set of all elements in \\( F \\) that map to the zero element in \\( K \\):\n\\[ \\text{ker}(\\phi) = \\{ a \\in F \\mid \\phi(a) = 0_K \\} \\]\n\nThe kernel of a homomorphism is always an ideal of the domain. However, since \\( F \\) is a field, its only ideals are the trivial ideal \\( \\{0\\} \\) and the entire field \\( F \\) itself.\n\n1. **Case 1: \\( \\text{ker}(\\phi) = \\{0\\} \\)**\n   \n   If the kernel contains only the zero element, this means that the only element in \\( F \\) that maps to zero in \\( K \\) is zero itself. This directly implies that \\( \\phi \\) is injective because no two distinct elements in \\( F \\) are mapped to the same element in \\( K \\).\n\n2. **Case 2: \\( \\text{ker}(\\phi) = F \\)**\n   \n   If the kernel is the entire field \\( F \\), this means that every element in \\( F \\) maps to zero in \\( K \\). In this scenario, \\( \\phi \\) is the trivial homomorphism, sending every element of \\( F \\) to zero in \\( K \\). While this map is certainly not injective, it is also not very interesting from a structural perspective.\n\nHowever, since fields are simple structures with only two ideals, any non-trivial homomorphism (one that doesn't send every element to zero) must have a kernel consisting solely of the zero element. Therefore, except for the trivial case where every element maps to zero, all field homomorphisms are injective.\n\nIn summary, every field homomorphism is either the trivial map sending every element to zero or an injective map. There are no other possibilities due to the simplicity of the field's structure regarding ideals.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'injective_of_kernel_eq_bot'\ntype mismatch\n  this\nhas type\n  \u03c6 x = \u03c6 y \u2192 x = y : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  x = y : Prop\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown constant 'RingHom.ker_eq_bot_of_injective'\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: invalid field notation, function 'RingHom.ker' does not have argument with type (RingHom ...) that can be used, it must be explicit or implicit with a unique name\ninvalid field notation, type is not of the form (C ...) where C is a constant\n  Injective\nhas type\n  (?m.1124 \u2192 ?m.1125) \u2192 Prop\nunknown constant 'RingHom.ker_eq_bot_of_injective'\nPlease revise the proof.",

Let's denote these subspaces as \\( U_1, U_2, \\dots, U_n \\).\n\nFirst, we can assume that \\( n \\) is at least 2, since if there was only one subspace, it wouldn't cover the entire space \\( V \\) because \\( U_1 \\) is a proper subspace. Moreover, let's choose \\( n \\) to be the smallest number of such subspaces needed to cover \\( V \\).\n\nNext, select a vector \\( y \\) that does not belong to the first subspace \\( U_1 \\). Such a vector exists because \\( U_1 \\) is a proper subspace and thus doesn't include every vector in \\( V \\). Now, take any vector \\( x \\) from \\( U_1 \\).\n\nSince the field \\( F \\) is infinite, we can pick a set \\( S \\) of \\( n+1 \\) distinct scalars from \\( F \\). For each scalar \\( \\alpha \\) in this set \\( S \\), consider the vector \\( x + \\alpha y \\). Because the entire space \\( V \\) is covered by the union of the subspaces \\( U_1, U_2, \\dots, U_n \\), each of these vectors must lie in at least one of the subspaces. Therefore, there is a function that assigns each \\( \\alpha \\) in \\( S \\) to one of the subspaces \\( U_i \\) such that \\( x + \\alpha y \\) belongs to \\( U_i \\).\n\nHowever, since there are \\( n+1 \\) scalars and only \\( n \\) subspaces, by the pigeonhole principle, at least two different scalars \\( \\alpha \\) and \\( \\beta \\) in \\( S \\) must be assigned to the same subspace, say \\( U_k \\). This means both \\( x + \\alpha y \\) and \\( x + \\beta y \\) are in \\( U_k \\).\n\nNow, consider the difference of these two vectors:\n\\[\ny = \\frac{(x + \\alpha y) - (x + \\beta y)}{\\alpha - \\beta}\n\\]\nSince both \\( x + \\alpha y \\) and \\( x + \\beta y \\) are in \\( U_k \\), their difference is also in \\( U_k \\), and thus \\( y \\) is in \\( U_k \\).\n\nBut we initially chose \\( y \\) such that it does not belong to \\( U_1 \\), which implies that \\( k \\) must be greater than 1; in other words, \\( y \\) lies in one of the other subspaces \\( U_2, \\dots, U_n \\).\n\nUsing this information, we can express \\( x \\) as:\n\\[\nx = (x + \\alpha y) - \\alpha y\n\\]\nSince both \\( x + \\alpha y \\) and \\( y \\) are in \\( U_k \\), it follows that \\( x \\) must also be in \\( U_k \\), and consequently, \\( x \\) belongs to one of the subspaces \\( U_2, \\dots, U_n \\).\n\nThis shows that every vector \\( x \\) in \\( U_1 \\) is also contained in \\( U_2 \\cup \\cdots \\cup U_n \\). Therefore, \\( U_1 \\) is entirely contained within the union of the other subspaces. This means that the original union \\( U_1 \\cup U_2 \\cup \\cdots \\cup U_n \\) is actually equal to \\( U_2 \\cup \\cdots \\cup U_n \\), effectively reducing the number of subspaces needed to cover \\( V \\) by one.\n\nThis contradicts our initial assumption that \\( n \\) was the minimal number of subspaces required to cover \\( V \\). Therefore, our assumption must be false, and \\( V \\) cannot be expressed as the union of finitely many proper subspaces.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown constant 'Fintype.nonempty'\nunknown constant 'Set.eq_top_iff'\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, equality or iff proof expected\n  ?m.2238\nK : Type u_1\nV : Type u_2\ninst\u271d\u00b3 : Field K\ninst\u271d\u00b2 : AddCommGroup V\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : Module K V\n\u03b9 : Type u_3\ninst\u271d : Fintype \u03b9\n\u03b3 : \u03b9 \u2192 Submodule K V\nh : \u2200 (i : \u03b9), \u03b3 i \u2260 \u22a4\nh_inter : \u22c2 i, \u2191(\u03b3 i) = \u22a4\ni : \u03b9\nh_proper : \u03b3 i \u2260 \u22a4\nh_inter_top : \u22c2 i, \u2191(\u03b3 i) = \u22a4\n\u22a2 False\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: type mismatch\n  h_inter_top\nhas type\n  \u22c2 i, \u2191(\u03b3 i) = \u22a4 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u22c2 i, ?m.2105 i = \u22a4 : Prop\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: type mismatch\n  h_inter_top\nhas type\n  \u22c2 i, \u2191(\u03b3 i) = \u22a4 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u22c2 i, ?m.2105 i = \u22a4 : Prop\nPlease revise the proof.",

Our goal is to show that such a group \\( G \\) cannot be simple, meaning it must have a nontrivial normal subgroup.\n\nFirst, recall that the order of a group is the number of its elements. Since \\( G \\) has order \\( pq \\), where both \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) are primes, we can apply the Sylow theorems, which provide information about the number and structure of subgroups of particular orders within \\( G \\).\n\nAccording to the Sylow theorems:\n\n1. The number of Sylow \\( p \\)-subgroups, denoted \\( n_p \\), must divide \\( q \\) and satisfy \\( n_p \\equiv 1 \\mod p \\).\n2. Similarly, the number of Sylow \\( q \\)-subgroups, denoted \\( n_q \\), must divide \\( p \\) and satisfy \\( n_q \\equiv 1 \\mod q \\).\n\nLet's analyze these conditions:\n\n- Since \\( q \\) is a prime and \\( n_p \\) divides \\( q \\), the possible values for \\( n_p \\) are 1 or \\( q \\). However, \\( n_p \\equiv 1 \\mod p \\) restricts \\( n_p \\) further. If \\( p \\) does not divide \\( q-1 \\), the only possibility is \\( n_p = 1 \\). This means there is exactly one Sylow \\( p \\)-subgroup in \\( G \\), and because it is unique, it must be normal in \\( G \\).\n\n- Similarly, \\( n_q \\) must divide \\( p \\) and satisfy \\( n_q \\equiv 1 \\mod q \\). Given that \\( p \\) is also a prime, the possible values for \\( n_q \\) are 1 or \\( p \\). If \\( q \\) does not divide \\( p-1 \\), then \\( n_q \\) must be 1, indicating that there is exactly one Sylow \\( q \\)-subgroup in \\( G \\), which would then be normal.\n\nIn either case, whether it's the Sylow \\( p \\)-subgroup or the Sylow \\( q \\)-subgroup that is unique and hence normal, \\( G \\) possesses a nontrivial normal subgroup. A simple group, by definition, has no such nontrivial normal subgroups. Therefore, the existence of this normal Sylow subgroup implies that \\( G \\) cannot be simple.\n\nIn conclusion, any group of order \\( pq \\), where \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) are distinct primes, must contain a nontrivial normal subgroup and thus cannot be simple.\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  @Sylow.exists_subgroup_card_pow_prime ?m.200 ?m.201 ?m.202 hp\nargument\n  hp\nhas type\n  Prime p : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u2115 : Type\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\nG : Type u_1\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : Group G\ninst\u271d : Fintype G\np q : \u2115\nhp : Prime p\nhq : Prime q\nhG : card G = p * q\nh_simple : IsSimpleGroup G\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nunsolved goals\nG : Type u_1\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : Group G\ninst\u271d : Fintype G\np q : \u2115\nhp : Prime p\nhq : Prime q\nhG : card G = p * q\nh_simple : IsSimpleGroup G\n\u22a2 false = true\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  @Sylow.exists_subgroup_card_pow_prime ?m.200 ?m.201 ?m.202 hp\nargument\n  hp\nhas type\n  Prime p : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u2115 : Type\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\nG : Type u_1\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : Group G\ninst\u271d : Fintype G\np q : \u2115\nhp : Prime p\nhq : Prime q\nhG : card G = p * q\nh_simple : IsSimpleGroup G\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nunsolved goals\nG : Type u_1\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : Group G\ninst\u271d : Fintype G\np q : \u2115\nhp : Prime p\nhq : Prime q\nhG : card G = p * q\nh_simple : IsSimpleGroup G\n\u22a2 false = true\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  @Sylow.exists_subgroup_card_pow_prime ?m.200 ?m.201 ?m.202 hp\nargument\n  hp\nhas type\n  Prime p : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u2115 : Type\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\nG : Type u_1\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : Group G\ninst\u271d : Fintype G\np q : \u2115\nhp : Prime p\nhq : Prime q\nhG : card G = p * q\nh_simple : IsSimpleGroup G\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nunsolved goals\nG : Type u_1\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : Group G\ninst\u271d : Fintype G\np q : \u2115\nhp : Prime p\nhq : Prime q\nhG : card G = p * q\nh_simple : IsSimpleGroup G\n\u22a2 false = true\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "# Informal Proof:\n\nTo demonstrate that every nonzero ideal in the ring of Gaussian integers contains a nonzero integer, let's begin by understanding the structure of Gaussian integers and their ideals.\n\n**Gaussian Integers and Principal Ideals:**\nThe Gaussian integers, denoted by \u2124[i], consist of all numbers of the form *a + b\u00b7i*, where *a* and *b* are integers, and *i* is the imaginary unit satisfying *i\u00b2 = -1*. Importantly, \u2124[i] is a *principal ideal domain* (PID). This means that every nonzero ideal in \u2124[i] can be generated by a single Gaussian integer. In other words, for any nonzero ideal **J** in \u2124[i], there exists some Gaussian integer *d* such that **J** = (d), where (d) represents all multiples of *d* by elements of \u2124[i].\n\n**Choosing a Generator with Minimal Norm:**\nWithin the ideal **J**, choose a generator *d = a + b\u00b7i* that has the smallest possible *norm* among all nonzero elements of **J**. The *norm* of a Gaussian integer *d = a + b\u00b7i* is defined as *N(d) = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2*. The norm is always a non-negative integer, and since *d* is nonzero, *N(d)* is a positive integer.\n\n**Connecting the Norm to an Integer in the Ideal:**\nConsider the product of *d* with its complex conjugate, which is *\\overline{d} = a - b\u00b7i*. Multiplying these gives:\n\n\\[ d \\cdot \\overline{d} = (a + b\u00b7i)(a - b\u00b7i) = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = N(d) \\]\n\nSince **J** is an ideal and contains *d*, it must also contain any product of *d* with elements of \u2124[i], including *\\overline{d}*. Therefore, *N(d)*, being the product of *d* and *\\overline{d}*, is an element of **J**.\n\n**Conclusion \u2013 Existence of a Nonzero Integer in the Ideal:**\nThe number *N(d)* is a positive integer (because it's the sum of two squares and *d* is nonzero), and we've established that *N(d)* belongs to **J**. Hence, every nonzero ideal **J** in the ring of Gaussian integers \u2124[i] contains at least one nonzero integer, specifically the norm of its generator.\n\nThis reasoning confirms that nonzero ideals in \u2124[i] are not just collections of Gaussian integers but inherently include standard integers as well.\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  \u27e8z, hz\u27e9\nargument\n  hz\nhas type\n  z \u2208 I \u2227 z \u2260 0 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  z \u2208 I : Prop\nunknown identifier 'eq_zero_of_mem_nonzero_ideal'\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unsolved goals\ncase h.mpr\nI : Ideal GaussianInt\nhI : I \u2260 \u22a5\nh' : \u2200 z \u2208 I, z = 0\nz : GaussianInt\nhz : z = 0\n\u22a2 z \u2208 I\ninvalid constructor \u27e8...\u27e9, expected type must be an inductive type \n  ?m.3161\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: 'GaussianInt' has already been declared\nunsolved goals\n\u22a2 False\ntype mismatch\n  h' hz\nhas type\n  z = 0 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  z \u2208 Ideal.zero : Prop\nunsolved goals\ncase h.mpr\nI : Ideal GaussianInt\nhI : I \u2260 Ideal.zero\nh' : \u2200 z \u2208 I, z = 0\nz : GaussianInt\nhz : z \u2208 Ideal.zero\n\u22a2 z \u2208 I\nfailed to synthesize\n  Membership \u2124 (Ideal GaussianInt)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\ntype mismatch\n  smul_mem I (\u2191z.re) hz\nhas type\n  \u2191z.re \u2022 z \u2208 I : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u2191z.re \u2208 I : Prop\ntype mismatch\n  smul_mem I (\u2191z.im) hz\nhas type\n  \u2191z.im \u2022 z \u2208 I : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u2191z.im \u2208 I : Prop\ntype mismatch\n  Ideal.add_mem I (mul_mem_left I (\u2191z.re) this) (mul_mem_left I (\u2191z.im) this)\nhas type\n  \u2191z.re * \u2191z.im + \u2191z.im * \u2191z.im \u2208 I : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u2191z.norm \u2208 I : Prop\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  z.norm\nI : Ideal GaussianInt\nhI : I \u2260 Ideal.zero\nz : GaussianInt\nhz : z \u2208 I\nhz_ne_zero : z \u2260 0\nh_norm : sorryAx Prop true\nh_norm_zero : z.norm = 0\n\u22a2 False\nunsolved goals\ncase h.right\nI : Ideal GaussianInt\nhI : I \u2260 Ideal.zero\nz : GaussianInt\nhz : z \u2208 I\nhz_ne_zero : z \u2260 0\nh_norm : sorryAx Prop true\nh_norm_ne_zero : z.norm \u2260 0\n\u22a2 z.im = 0\nPlease revise the proof.",

Our goal is to find a subspace \\( U \\) of \\( V \\) with two key properties:\n\n1. **Intersection with Kernel:** \\( U \\) intersects the kernel of \\( T \\) only at the zero vector, meaning \\( U \\cap \\ker T = \\{0\\} \\).\n2. **Covering the Range:** Every vector in the range of \\( T \\) can be expressed as \\( T(u) \\) for some \\( u \\) in \\( U \\), i.e., \\( \\text{Range}(T) = \\{T(u) : u \\in U\\} \\).\n\nHere's how we can construct such a subspace \\( U \\):\n\n1. **Choose a Basis for \\( V \\):** Since \\( V \\) is finite-dimensional, suppose its dimension is \\( n \\). The kernel of \\( T \\), \\( \\ker T \\), is a subspace of \\( V \\). Let's say \\( \\ker T \\) has dimension \\( k \\).\n\n2. **Extend the Basis of the Kernel:** Start by selecting a basis for \\( \\ker T \\). Let's denote these basis vectors as \\( \\{v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_k\\} \\). Because \\( \\ker T \\) is a subspace, these vectors are linearly independent and span \\( \\ker T \\).\n\n3. **Complete the Basis for \\( V \\):** Since \\( \\dim(V) = n \\), we need to add \\( n - k \\) more vectors to this basis to span the entire space \\( V \\). Let\u2019s add vectors \\( \\{u_1, u_2, \\ldots, u_{n-k}\\} \\) such that the complete set \\( \\{v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_k, u_1, u_2, \\ldots, u_{n-k}\\} \\) forms a basis for \\( V \\).\n\n4. **Define Subspace \\( U \\):** Let \\( U \\) be the subspace spanned by the vectors \\( \\{u_1, u_2, \\ldots, u_{n-k}\\} \\). By construction, \\( U \\) has dimension \\( n - k \\), and since none of the \\( u_i \\) are in \\( \\ker T \\) (otherwise, they would be part of the original basis for \\( \\ker T \\)), it follows that \\( U \\cap \\ker T = \\{0\\} \\). This satisfies our first requirement.\n\n5. **Mapping \\( U \\) to the Range of \\( T \\):** Consider the images of the basis vectors of \\( U \\) under \\( T \\), i.e., \\( T(u_1), T(u_2), \\ldots, T(u_{n-k}) \\). Since these \\( u_i \\) are not in \\( \\ker T \\), their images are non-zero and, importantly, they span the range of \\( T \\). This is because any vector in \\( \\text{Range}(T) \\) can be expressed as \\( T(v) \\) for some \\( v \\in V \\), and since \\( V \\) is spanned by \\( \\ker T \\) and \\( U \\), it's sufficient to consider vectors in \\( U \\) to cover the entire range.\n\n6. **Conclusion:** The subspace \\( U \\) we've constructed satisfies both required properties:\n   - \\( U \\cap \\ker T = \\{0\\} \\), ensuring there's no overlap between \\( U \\) and the kernel except at the zero vector.\n   - \\( \\text{Range}(T) = \\{T(u) : u \\in U\\} \\), meaning that every vector in the range of \\( T \\) comes from some vector in \\( U \\) under the transformation \\( T \\).\n\nThus, such a subspace \\( U \\) indeed exists within \\( V \\), fulfilling the conditions set out in the problem.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'let'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'let'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'let'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

Specifically, there exist scalars \\( a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_m \\) such that:\n\\[\nv = a_1 e_1 + a_2 e_2 + \\cdots + a_m e_m\n\\]\nTaking the inner product of both sides with \\( e_j \\) (where \\( j \\) is any index from 1 to \\( m \\)), and using the fact that the basis is orthonormal, we have:\n\\[\n\\langle v, e_j \\rangle = a_1 \\langle e_1, e_j \\rangle + a_2 \\langle e_2, e_j \\rangle + \\cdots + a_m \\langle e_m, e_j \\rangle = a_j\n\\]\nThis shows that each coefficient \\( a_j \\) is exactly the inner product \\( \\langle v, e_j \\rangle \\).\n\nNow, the norm squared of \\( v \\) is:\n\\[\n\\|v\\|^2 = \\langle v, v \\rangle = \\langle a_1 e_1 + \\cdots + a_m e_m, a_1 e_1 + \\cdots + a_m e_m \\rangle\n\\]\nExpanding this using linearity and the orthonormality of the basis (where \\( \\langle e_i, e_j \\rangle = \\delta_{ij} \\)), we get:\n\\[\n\\|v\\|^2 = |a_1|^2 + |a_2|^2 + \\cdots + |a_m|^2 = |\\langle v, e_1 \\rangle|^2 + \\cdots + |\\langle v, e_m \\rangle|^2\n\\]\nThus, when \\( v \\) is in the span of the orthonormal vectors, the norm squared of \\( v \\) is indeed the sum of the squares of its inner products with each \\( e_i \\).\n\n### 2. Conversely, if \\( \\|v\\|^2 = |\\langle v, e_1 \\rangle|^2 + \\cdots + |\\langle v, e_m \\rangle|^2 \\), then \\( v \\) must lie in the span of \\( \\{e_1, \\ldots, e_m\\} \\).\n\nAssume that the equality \\( \\|v\\|^2 = |\\langle v, e_1 \\rangle|^2 + \\cdots + |\\langle v, e_m \\rangle|^2 \\) holds. Let's consider the component of \\( v \\) that lies outside the span of \\( \\{e_1, \\ldots, e_m\\} \\). \n\nSuppose, for contradiction, that \\( v \\) has a component \\( w \\) that is orthogonal to all \\( e_i \\). Then we can write:\n\\[\nv = \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^m \\langle v, e_i \\rangle e_i \\right) + w\n\\]\nSince \\( w \\) is orthogonal to each \\( e_i \\), its inner product with any \\( e_j \\) is zero:\n\\[\n\\langle w, e_j \\rangle = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } j = 1, \\ldots, m\n\\]\nThe norm squared of \\( v \\) would then be:\n\\[\n\\|v\\|^2 = \\left\\| \\sum_{i=1}^m \\langle v, e_i \\rangle e_i \\right\\|^2 + \\|w\\|^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^m |\\langle v, e_i \\rangle|^2 + \\|w\\|^2\n\\]\nHowever, our assumption states that \\( \\|v\\|^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^m |\\langle v, e_i \\rangle|^2 \\). Comparing the two expressions, we must have \\( \\|w\\|^2 = 0 \\), which implies that \\( w = 0 \\).\n\nTherefore, there is no component of \\( v \\) outside the span of \\( \\{e_1, \\ldots, e_m\\} \\), meaning \\( v \\) itself lies entirely within this span.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy proving both directions\u2014that a vector in the span satisfies the norm equality and that the norm equality implies the vector is in the span\u2014we have established that:\n\\[\n\\|v\\|^{2} = |\\langle v, e_{1} \\rangle|^{2} + \\cdots + |\\langle v, e_{m} \\rangle|^{2} \\quad \\text{if and only if} \\quad v \\in \\operatorname{span}\\left(e_{1}, \\ldots, e_{m}\\right)\n\\]\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

Specifically, a subspace must be closed under addition and scalar multiplication. If we can find normal operators whose sum is not normal, it will prove that the set of normal operators fails to be closed under addition and thus is not a subspace.\n\nFirst, recall that a normal operator \\( T \\) satisfies the condition \\( T T^* = T^* T \\), where \\( T^* \\) is the adjoint of \\( T \\). In a vector space of dimension at least 2, we can construct specific examples of normal operators and examine their sum.\n\nConsider two normal operators \\( T \\) and \\( S \\) on \\( V \\). Suppose \\( T \\) is a diagonal operator with distinct eigenvalues, and \\( S \\) is another diagonal operator with different distinct eigenvalues. Both \\( T \\) and \\( S \\) individually satisfy the normality condition because they commute with their adjoints. However, when we add these two operators to form \\( T + S \\), the resulting operator may no longer be normal. This is because the commutativity between \\( T \\) and \\( S \\) (i.e., \\( T S = S T \\)) is not guaranteed unless they share the same eigenvectors, which is not the case in general for distinct diagonal operators in a space of dimension at least 2.\n\nFor example, let \\( V = \\mathbb{R}^2 \\) and define:\n- \\( T \\) as the operator represented by the matrix \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} \\)\n- \\( S \\) as the operator represented by the matrix \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 4 \\end{pmatrix} \\)\n\nBoth \\( T \\) and \\( S \\) are normal since they are diagonal and thus commute with their adjoints. However, their sum \\( T + S = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 6 \\end{pmatrix} \\) is also diagonal and hence normal in this specific case. To find operators where the sum is not normal, we can choose non-diagonal normal operators that do not commute.\n\nConsider:\n- \\( T = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\), which is normal because \\( T T^* = T^2 = I \\)\n- \\( S = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & i \\\\ -i & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\), which is also normal\n\nTheir sum:\n\\( T + S = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 + i \\\\ 1 - i & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\)\n\nCalculating \\( (T + S)(T + S)^* \\) and \\( (T + S)^*(T + S) \\) will show that they are not equal, meaning \\( T + S \\) is not normal. This example illustrates that the sum of two normal operators need not be normal.\n\nSince we can find normal operators whose sum is not normal in a space of dimension at least 2, the set of normal operators fails to be closed under addition. Therefore, the set of normal operators on \\( V \\) is not a subspace of \\( \\mathcal{L}(V) \\) when \\( \\dim V \\geq 2 \\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: type mismatch\n  ![![0, 1], ![1, 0]]\nhas type\n  Fin (Nat.succ 0).succ \u2192 Fin (Nat.succ 0).succ \u2192 ?m.14131 : Type ?u.14130\nbut is expected to have type\n  End \u2102 V : Type u_1\ntype mismatch\n  ![![0, 1], ![1, 0]]\nhas type\n  Fin (Nat.succ 0).succ \u2192 Fin (Nat.succ 0).succ \u2192 ?m.18218 : Type ?u.18217\nbut is expected to have type\n  End \u2102 V : Type u_1\ntype mismatch\n  this\nhas type\n  \u2203 T, T * adjoint T \u2260 adjoint T * T : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  False : Prop\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: type mismatch\n  ![![0, 1], ![1, 0]]\nhas type\n  Fin (Nat.succ 0).succ \u2192 Fin (Nat.succ 0).succ \u2192 ?m.14131 : Type ?u.14130\nbut is expected to have type\n  End \u2102 V : Type u_1\ntype mismatch\n  ![![0, -1], ![1, 0]]\nhas type\n  Fin (Nat.succ 0).succ \u2192 Fin (Nat.succ 0).succ \u2192 ?m.18465 : Type ?u.18464\nbut is expected to have type\n  End \u2102 V : Type u_1\ntype mismatch\n  h\nhas type\n  \u2203 T, T * adjoint T \u2260 adjoint T * T : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  False : Prop\nPlease revise the proof.",

Therefore, all eigenvalues of a self-adjoint normal operator are real.\n\n**2.

We aim to show that \\( \\hat{N} \\) must be self-adjoint.\n\nSince \\( \\hat{N} \\) is normal, it can be diagonalized with an orthonormal set of eigenvectors.

For each eigenvector:\n\\[\n\\hat{N} \\left| x_i \\right\\rangle = \\lambda_i \\left| x_i \\right\\rangle\n\\]\nTaking the adjoint of both sides:\n\\[\n\\left\\langle x_i \\right| \\hat{N}^\\dagger = \\lambda_i \\left\\langle x_i \\right|\n\\]\nBut since \\( \\lambda_i \\) is real, this can be written as:\n\\[\n\\left\\langle x_i \\right| \\hat{N}^\\dagger = \\lambda_i \\left\\langle x_i \\right|\n\\]\nComparing this with the original eigenvalue equation, we see that:\n\\[\n\\hat{N}^\\dagger \\left| x_i \\right\\rangle = \\lambda_i \\left| x_i \\right\\rangle = \\hat{N} \\left| x_i \\right\\rangle\n\\]\nThis equality holds for all eigenvectors \\( \\left| x_i \\right\\rangle \\).

This property is significant because normal operators on a complex inner-product space have a well-behaved structure, especially concerning their eigenvalues and eigenvectors.\n\n**Applying the Spectral Theorem:**\nThe spectral theorem is a cornerstone in the study of normal operators.

In other words, there exists an orthonormal basis of \\( V \\) consisting of eigenvectors of \\( T \\), and \\( T \\) can be represented as a diagonal matrix whose entries are the eigenvalues of \\( T \\).\n\n**Constructing the Square Root:**\nGiven that \\( T \\) is normal and thus diagonalizable, let\u2019s denote its eigenvalues by \\( \\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\ldots, \\lambda_n \\), corresponding to the orthonormal eigenvectors \\( v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_n \\).

The order of an element \\( g \\in G \\), denoted \\( |g| \\), is the smallest positive integer \\( n \\) such that \\( g^n = e \\), where \\( e \\) is the identity element of the group.\n\nThe problem asks us to deduce that \\( |ab| = |ba| \\) for all \\( a, b \\in G \\). To approach this, consider the following reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding Element Orders:**\n   - The order of \\( ab \\) is the smallest positive integer \\( n \\) for which \\( (ab)^n = e \\).\n   - Similarly, the order of \\( ba \\) is the smallest positive integer \\( m \\) for which \\( (ba)^m = e \\).\n\n2. **Exploring Group Properties:**\n   - In general groups, elements do not necessarily commute; that is, \\( ab \\) might not equal \\( ba \\).\n   - However, even if elements do not commute, there might be relationships between the orders of \\( ab \\) and \\( ba \\).\n\n3. **Assessing Equality of Orders:**\n   - To claim that \\( |ab| = |ba| \\) for all \\( a, b \\in G \\), we would need to establish a general mechanism or property within the group that ensures this equality.\n   - One might consider whether \\( ab \\) and \\( ba \\) are related through conjugation or other group operations that preserve order.

        "informal_proof": "# Informal Proof:\n\nTo establish that \\( S_{\\Omega} \\), the symmetric group on the set \\( \\Omega = \\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\} \\), is an infinite group, we can proceed by considering two main aspects: verifying the group properties and demonstrating the infinitude of the group.\n\n**1. Verifying Group Properties:**\n\nFirstly, recall that a group must satisfy four fundamental axioms: closure, associativity, the existence of an identity element, and the existence of inverses for every element.\n\n- **Closure:** In \\( S_{\\Omega} \\), the composition of any two permutations (bijections) is also a permutation. Since each permutation rearranges the elements of \\( \\Omega \\) without omission or repetition, composing two such rearrangements results in another valid rearrangement within \\( S_{\\Omega} \\). Thus, \\( S_{\\Omega} \\) is closed under composition.\n\n- **Associativity:** Composition of functions is inherently associative. That is, for any three permutations \\( f, g, h \\) in \\( S_{\\Omega} \\), the equation \\( (f \\circ g) \\circ h = f \\circ (g \\circ h) \\) holds true. This property ensures that the group operation is associative.\n\n- **Identity Element:** The identity permutation, which maps every element of \\( \\Omega \\) to itself, serves as the identity element in \\( S_{\\Omega} \\). For any permutation \\( f \\) in \\( S_{\\Omega} \\), composing it with the identity permutation leaves \\( f \\) unchanged, satisfying the identity axiom.\n\n- **Inverses:** For every permutation \\( f \\) in \\( S_{\\Omega} \\), there exists an inverse permutation \\( f^{-1} \\) such that \\( f \\circ f^{-1} \\) is the identity permutation. Since permutations are bijections, each has a well-defined inverse that reverts the rearrangement performed by \\( f \\).\n\nHaving verified all group axioms, we confirm that \\( S_{\\Omega} \\) is indeed a group.\n\n**2. Demonstrating Infinitude:**\n\nNext, to show that \\( S_{\\Omega} \\) is infinite, consider the nature of the set \\( \\Omega = \\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\} \\). Since \\( \\Omega \\) is an infinite set, there are infinitely many ways to rearrange its elements. Specifically, even if we fix all but one element, there are infinitely many choices for the image of that single element, leading to infinitely many distinct permutations.\n\nFor example, consider the set of permutations that only alter the position of the number 1, leaving all other elements fixed. Each permutation can send 1 to any natural number in \\( \\Omega \\), and since there are infinitely many natural numbers, there are infinitely many such distinct permutations. This argument extends to more complex rearrangements, further ensuring that \\( S_{\\Omega} \\) contains an infinite number of elements.\n\nTherefore, combining the verification of the group properties with the demonstration of its infinite size, we conclude that \\( S_{\\Omega} \\) is an infinite group.\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  Eq.trans h1 (Eq.symm h2)\nargument\n  Eq.symm h2\nhas type\n  b = a : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  (Equiv.swap 0 b) 1 = ?m.17721 : Prop\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  Eq.trans (Eq.symm h1) h2\nargument\n  h2\nhas type\n  a = b : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  (Equiv.swap 0 a) 1 = ?m.17725 : Prop\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  Eq.trans h1 (Eq.symm h2)\nargument\n  Eq.symm h2\nhas type\n  b = a : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  (Equiv.swap 0 b) 1 = ?m.17721 : Prop\nPlease revise the proof.",

Specifically, for any elements \\( (a, b) \\) in \\( A \\times B \\), we define:\n\\[ \\theta(a, b) = (b, a) \\]\n \n**Step 1: Well-Defined Mapping**\nFirst, we verify that \\( \\theta \\) is well-defined. Since \\( a \\) belongs to \\( A \\) and \\( b \\) belongs to \\( B \\), their swapped pair \\( (b, a) \\) naturally belongs to \\( B \\times A \\). Thus, \\( \\theta \\) correctly maps elements from \\( A \\times B \\) to \\( B \\times A \\).\n\n**Step 2: Homomorphism Property**\nNext, we need to ensure that \\( \\theta \\) preserves the group operation. In the direct product \\( A \\times B \\), the operation is defined component-wise:\n\\[ (a_1, b_1) \\cdot (a_2, b_2) = (a_1 \\cdot_A a_2, b_1 \\cdot_B b_2) \\]\nApplying \\( \\theta \\) to the product, we get:\n\\[ \\theta((a_1 \\cdot_A a_2, b_1 \\cdot_B b_2)) = (b_1 \\cdot_B b_2, a_1 \\cdot_A a_2) \\]\nOn the other hand, applying \\( \\theta \\) first and then performing the operation in \\( B \\times A \\):\n\\[ \\theta(a_1, b_1) \\cdot \\theta(a_2, b_2) = (b_1, a_1) \\cdot (b_2, a_2) = (b_1 \\cdot_B b_2, a_1 \\cdot_A a_2) \\]\nSince both approaches yield the same result, \\( \\theta \\) preserves the group operation, making it a homomorphism.\n\n**Step 3: Bijectiveness**\nTo establish that \\( \\theta \\) is an isomorphism, we must show that it is both injective (one-to-one) and surjective (onto).\n\n- **Injective:** Suppose \\( \\theta(a_1, b_1) = \\theta(a_2, b_2) \\). This means \\( (b_1, a_1) = (b_2, a_2) \\). Therefore, \\( b_1 = b_2 \\) and \\( a_1 = a_2 \\), which implies \\( (a_1, b_1) = (a_2, b_2) \\). Hence, \\( \\theta \\) is injective.\n\n- **Surjective:** For any element \\( (b, a) \\) in \\( B \\times A \\), there exists an element \\( (a, b) \\) in \\( A \\times B \\) such that \\( \\theta(a, b) = (b, a) \\). This ensures that every element in \\( B \\times A \\) has a preimage in \\( A \\times B \\), making \\( \\theta \\) surjective.\n\n**Conclusion**\nSince \\( \\theta \\) is a bijective homomorphism, it is an isomorphism between \\( A \\times B \\) and \\( B \\times A \\).

In other words, for any two elements \\( a, b \\in G \\), \\( \\sigma(ab) = \\sigma(a)\\sigma(b) \\).\n   - \\( \\sigma^2 \\) is the identity map, which means applying \\( \\sigma \\) twice brings any element back to itself: \\( \\sigma(\\sigma(g)) = g \\) for all \\( g \\in G \\).\n\n2. **Fixed Points of \\( \\sigma \\)**:\n   - The only element fixed by \\( \\sigma \\) is the identity element \\( 1 \\). That is, \\( \\sigma(g) = g \\) if and only if \\( g = 1 \\).\n\n3. **Implications for \\( \\sigma \\)**:\n   - Since \\( \\sigma^2 \\) is the identity, \\( \\sigma \\) is its own inverse: \\( \\sigma^{-1} = \\sigma \\).\n   - Because \\( \\sigma \\) has order 2 (applying it twice yields the identity), it partitions the group \\( G \\) into pairs of elements. Specifically, for each \\( g \\in G \\) (other than the identity), \\( \\sigma(g) \\) is a distinct element paired with \\( g \\), since \\( \\sigma(g) \\neq g \\) unless \\( g = 1 \\).\n\n4. **Structure of \\( G \\)**:\n   - Since \\( G \\) is finite and every non-identity element pairs with a unique other element under \\( \\sigma \\), the order of \\( G \\) must be odd or even. However, the key property here is the behavior of \\( \\sigma \\) acting on the elements.\n\n5. **Establishing Commutativity**:\n   - To show \\( G \\) is abelian (commutative), we need to prove that for any two elements \\( a, b \\in G \\), the equation \\( ab = ba \\) holds.\n   - Consider the automorphism \\( \\sigma \\). Since \\( \\sigma \\) preserves the group operation, applying \\( \\sigma \\) to both sides of \\( ab = ba \\) gives \\( \\sigma(ab) = \\sigma(b)\\sigma(a) \\).\n   - But \\( \\sigma(ab) = \\sigma(a)\\sigma(b) \\) because \\( \\sigma \\) is a homomorphism. Therefore, \\( \\sigma(a)\\sigma(b) = \\sigma(b)\\sigma(a) \\).\n   - This implies that \\( \\sigma(a) \\) and \\( \\sigma(b) \\) commute for all \\( a, b \\in G \\).\n   \n6. **Leveraging the Properties of \\( \\sigma \\)**:\n   - Since \\( \\sigma \\) pairs elements uniquely and only the identity is fixed, every element can be expressed in terms of its image under \\( \\sigma \\).\n   - Let\u2019s consider the inverse of an element: for any \\( g \\in G \\), since \\( \\sigma^2(g) = g \\), we have \\( \\sigma(g) = g^{-1} \\). This means \\( \\sigma \\) sends each element to its inverse.\n   \n7. **Conclusion of Commutativity**:\n   - Given \\( \\sigma(g) = g^{-1} \\) for all \\( g \\in G \\), and knowing that \\( \\sigma \\) preserves the group operation, we have:\n     \\[\n     \\sigma(ab) = \\sigma(a)\\sigma(b) = a^{-1}b^{-1}\n     \\]\n   - But since \\( \\sigma(ab) = (ab)^{-1} = b^{-1}a^{-1} \\), we equate the two expressions:\n     \\[\n     a^{-1}b^{-1} = b^{-1}a^{-1}\n     \\]\n   - Multiplying both sides on the left by \\( a \\) and on the right by \\( b \\), we get:\n     \\[\n     b^{-1} = b^{-1}\n     \\]\n     which is always true, but to extract more information, observe that:\n     \\[\n     a^{-1}b^{-1} = b^{-1}a^{-1} \\implies ab = ba\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, for any \\( a, b \\in G \\), \\( ab = ba \\), which means \\( G \\) is abelian.\n\nIn summary, the existence of such an automorphism \\( \\sigma \\) that squares to the identity and only fixes the identity element forces the group \\( G \\) to be abelian, as it enforces that every pair of elements commutes.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

Understanding Maximal Subgroups:**\nA maximal subgroup \\( M \\) of \\( G \\) is defined as a proper subgroup (\\( M \\neq G \\)) such that there are no subgroups of \\( G \\) that lie strictly between \\( M \\) and \\( G \\). In other words, the only subgroups containing \\( M \\) are \\( M \\) itself and the entire group \\( G \\).\n\n**2.

Let's denote this collection by:\n\\[\n\\mathcal{C} = \\{ K \\leq G \\mid H \\subseteq K \\}\n\\]\n\n**3. Applying Maximality in Finite Sets:**\nBecause \\( G \\) is a finite group, the collection \\( \\mathcal{C} \\) is also finite.

The order of \\( K \\) must divide \\( n \\) and be a multiple of \\( |H| = n/p \\).\n   - Since \\( p \\) is prime, the only multiples of \\( n/p \\) that divide \\( n \\) are \\( n/p \\) itself and \\( n \\). This means \\( K \\) must be either \\( H \\) or \\( G \\).\n   - Hence, there are no subgroups strictly between \\( H \\) and \\( G \\), confirming that \\( H \\) is maximal.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nTherefore, in a cyclic group \\( G \\) of order \\( n \\), a subgroup \\( H \\) is maximal if and only if it is generated by \\( x^{p} \\) for some prime \\( p \\) that divides \\( n \\).

This means that the order of \\( G \\) is \\( |G| = p \\cdot |H| \\). Our goal is to show that for any subgroup \\( K \\) of \\( G \\), one of two scenarios must hold: either \\( K \\) is entirely contained within \\( H \\), or the group \\( G \\) can be expressed as the product of \\( H \\) and \\( K \\), and the intersection \\( K \\cap H \\) has index \\( p \\) in \\( K \\).\n\n1. **Case 1: \\( K \\) is a subgroup of \\( H \\) (\\( K \\leq H \\))**\n   \n   If \\( K \\) is entirely contained within \\( H \\), then we've directly satisfied the first condition. There's nothing more to prove in this scenario.\n\n2. **Case 2: \\( K \\) is not entirely contained within \\( H \\) (\\( K \\nleq H \\))**\n   \n   - **Understanding the Structure:**\n     \n     Since \\( H \\) is normal in \\( G \\), we can consider the quotient group \\( G/H \\), which has order \\( p \\) (a prime). The subgroup \\( K \\) maps to a subgroup of \\( G/H \\) under the natural projection. Because \\( G/H \\) has prime order, its only subgroups are the trivial group and itself.\n   \n   - **Analyzing the Projection:**\n     \n     - If the image of \\( K \\) in \\( G/H \\) is trivial, then \\( K \\) must be entirely contained within \\( H \\), which brings us back to Case 1.\n     - If the image of \\( K \\) is the entire \\( G/H \\), this means that \\( K \\) and \\( H \\) together generate the entire group \\( G \\). In other words, every element \\( g \\in G \\) can be written as a product \\( g = hk \\) for some \\( h \\in H \\) and \\( k \\in K \\). This gives us \\( G = HK \\).\n   \n   - **Determining the Index:**\n     \n     Since \\( G = HK \\) and \\( H \\) is normal, we can apply the Second Isomorphism Theorem. This theorem tells us that the quotient \\( K/(K \\cap H) \\) is isomorphic to \\( HK/H \\), which is itself isomorphic to \\( G/H \\) because \\( G = HK \\). Since \\( G/H \\) has order \\( p \\), it follows that \\( K/(K \\cap H) \\) also has order \\( p \\). Therefore, the subgroup \\( K \\cap H \\) has index \\( p \\) in \\( K \\), formally written as \\( |K : K \\cap H| = p \\).\n\nIn summary, for any subgroup \\( K \\) of \\( G \\):\n\n- If \\( K \\) is contained within \\( H \\), we're done.\n- If not, then \\( G \\) is the product of \\( H \\) and \\( K \\), and the intersection \\( K \\cap H \\) has index \\( p \\) in \\( K \\).\n\nThis exhaustively covers all possibilities, thereby proving the statement.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'relindex_dvd_of_le_normal'\ntype mismatch\n  Eq.symm hd\nhas type\n  0 = \u2191p : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  H.relindex K = 0 : Prop\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  ?n * 1\ncase intro.succ.h\np : Nat.Primes\nG : Type u_1\ninst\u271d : Group G\nH : Subgroup G\nhH : H.Normal\nhH1 : H.index = \u2191p\nK : Subgroup G\nd : \u2115\nhd : \u2191p = H.relindex K * (d + 1)\n\u22a2 H.relindex K = \u2191p\nunknown identifier 'relindex_eq_zero_of_le'\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  ?H.index\ncase inr.h.h\np : Nat.Primes\nG : Type u_1\ninst\u271d : Group G\nH : Subgroup G\nhH : H.Normal\nhH1 : H.index = \u2191p\nK : Subgroup G\nh1 : H.relindex K = \u2191p\n\u22a2 H \u2294 K = \u22a4\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  card ?m.653\np : Nat.Primes\nG : Type u_1\ninst\u271d : Group G\nH : Subgroup G\nhH : H.Normal\nhH1 : H.index = \u2191p\nK : Subgroup G\nh : H.relindex K = 0\n\u22a2 False\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  card ?m.1166\np : Nat.Primes\nG : Type u_1\ninst\u271d : Group G\nH : Subgroup G\nhH : H.Normal\nhH1 : H.index = \u2191p\nK : Subgroup G\nh1 : H.relindex K \u2260 0\n\u22a2 K \u2264 H \u2228 H \u2294 K = \u22a4 \u2228 (K \u2293 H).relindex K = \u2191p\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'relindex_dvd_of_le_normal'\ntactic 'contradiction' failed\ncase inl\np : Nat.Primes\nG : Type u_1\ninst\u271d : Group G\nH : Subgroup G\nhH : H.Normal\nhH1 : H.index = \u2191p\nK : Subgroup G\nh : H.relindex K \u2260 0\nh3 : H.relindex K \u2223 \u2191p\nh4 : 1 \u2260 0\nh6 : H.relindex K = 1\n\u22a2 False\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  H.relindex K\np : Nat.Primes\nG : Type u_1\ninst\u271d : Group G\nH : Subgroup G\nhH : H.Normal\nhH1 : H.index = \u2191p\nK : Subgroup G\nh : H.relindex K \u2260 0\nh2 : H.relindex K = \u2191p\n\u22a2 H \u2294 K = \u22a4\nunknown identifier 'le_of_relindex_eq_zero'\napplication type mismatch\n  h1 h2\nargument\n  h2\nhas type\n  H.relindex K > 0 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  H.relindex K \u2260 0 : Prop\nPlease revise the proof.",

Our goal is to show that this holds true for \\( G \\) itself.\n\nLet \\( n \\) be a positive divisor of \\( |G| \\).

Our goal is to find a normal subgroup \\( K \\) of \\( G \\) such that \\( K \\) is contained within \\( H \\), and the index \\( [G : K] \\) is at most \\( n! \\) (the factorial of \\( n \\)).\n\nTo achieve this, we utilize the concept of the **permutation representation** of \\( G \\) acting on the cosets of \\( H \\). Here's how the reasoning unfolds:\n\n1. **Action on Cosets:** Since \\( H \\) has finite index \\( n \\), \\( G \\) can act on the set of its cosets \\( G/H \\) by left multiplication. This action induces a homomorphism from \\( G \\) to the symmetric group \\( S_n \\), which consists of all permutations of \\( n \\) elements.\n\n2. **Kernel of the Action:** The kernel of this homomorphism, let's call it \\( N \\), consists of all elements in \\( G \\) that fix every coset of \\( H \\). In other words, \\( N \\) is the set of elements in \\( G \\) that act trivially on \\( G/H \\). By definition, the kernel \\( N \\) is a normal subgroup of \\( G \\).\n\n3. **Normality and Containment:** Since \\( N \\) is in the kernel, it must be contained within every stabilizer of the action. Specifically, \\( N \\) is contained within \\( H \\), making \\( N \\) a normal subgroup of both \\( G \\) and \\( H \\).\n\n4. **Index Relationship:** The homomorphism from \\( G \\) to \\( S_n \\) maps \\( G \\) onto a subgroup \\( K \\) of \\( S_n \\) isomorphic to \\( G/N \\). Therefore, the index \\( [G : N] \\) is equal to the order of this image subgroup \\( K \\). Since \\( K \\) is a subgroup of \\( S_n \\), its order divides \\( n! \\) (by Lagrange's theorem, which states that the order of a subgroup divides the order of the group).\n\n5. **Bounding the Index:** From the above, we have that \\( [G : N] \\) divides \\( n! \\). Additionally, because \\( H \\) has index \\( n \\) in \\( G \\), it follows that \\( n \\) divides \\( [G : N] \\). Combining these facts, we see that \\( [G : N] \\) is a multiple of \\( n \\) and also a divisor of \\( n! \\).\n\n6. **Conclusion:** By setting \\( K = N \\), we have a normal subgroup of \\( G \\) (since \\( N \\) is normal in \\( G \\)) that is contained within \\( H \\) and satisfies \\( [G : K] \\leq n! \\).\n\nThus, we've successfully identified a normal subgroup \\( K \\) of \\( G \\) contained in \\( H \\) with the index \\( [G : K] \\) bounded above by \\( n! \\), as required.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'let'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'let'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'let'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

We want to show that any subgroup \\( H \\) of \\( G \\) with index \\( p \\) (meaning there are \\( p \\) distinct left cosets of \\( H \\) in \\( G \\)) is necessarily a normal subgroup of \\( G \\).\n\nFirst, recall that the index of a subgroup \\( H \\) in \\( G \\), denoted \\( [G : H] \\), is the number of distinct cosets of \\( H \\) in \\( G \\). In our case, \\( [G : H] = p \\), so the order of \\( H \\) is \\( |H| = p^{\\alpha - 1} \\).\n\nNow, consider the action of \\( G \\) on the set of left cosets of \\( H \\) by left multiplication. This action gives rise to a homomorphism from \\( G \\) to the symmetric group on \\( p \\) elements, \\( S_p \\), because there are \\( p \\) cosets. The kernel of this homomorphism is the intersection of all conjugates of \\( H \\), known as the core of \\( H \\) in \\( G \\), which is the largest normal subgroup of \\( G \\) contained within \\( H \\).\n\nIf \\( H \\) were not normal in \\( G \\), the core would be a proper subgroup of \\( H \\), and thus its order would divide \\( p^{\\alpha - 1} \\). However, since \\( p \\) is the smallest prime dividing the order of \\( G \\), and the index \\( [G : H] = p \\) is also the smallest possible index for a nontrivial subgroup, the only way for the homomorphism to behave consistently with these constraints is if the kernel is actually \\( H \\) itself. This implies that the homomorphism is trivial, meaning every element of \\( G \\) maps to the identity permutation in \\( S_p \\).\n\nConsequently, the left cosets of \\( H \\) are fixed under the action of \\( G \\), which means that \\( H \\) is invariant under conjugation by any element of \\( G \\).

Specifically, let \\( P \\) be the Sylow \\( p \\)-subgroup and \\( Q \\) be the Sylow \\( q \\)-subgroup of \\( G \\). Since \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) are distinct primes, these subgroups are unique and their intersection contains only the identity element of \\( G \\), denoted by \\( e \\). In other words, \\( P \\cap Q = \\{e\\} \\).\n\nNext, we examine the combined elements of \\( P \\) and \\( Q \\). The total number of distinct elements in \\( P \\cup Q \\) is \\( p + q - 1 \\). This count comes from adding the number of elements in \\( P \\) and \\( Q \\) and then subtracting one to account for the shared identity element.\n\nHowever, the entire group \\( G \\) has \\( pq \\) elements. Since \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) are both primes greater than 1, the product \\( pq \\) is always greater than \\( p + q - 1 \\). Specifically, \\( pq \\geq 2q \\) (because \\( p \\geq 2 \\)) and \\( 2q > q + p - 1 \\) when \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) are distinct primes.\n\nThis discrepancy means that there must be elements in \\( G \\) that are not included in \\( P \\cup Q \\). Take any such non-identity element outside \\( P \\) and \\( Q \\); its order must be \\( pq \\) because it cannot be \\( p \\) or \\( q \\) (as those orders are confined to \\( P \\) and \\( Q \\), respectively).\n\nAn element of order \\( pq \\) generates the entire group \\( G \\) since \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) are distinct primes and thus relatively prime. Therefore, \\( G \\) has an element that generates it, which means \\( G \\) is cyclic by definition.\n\nThis reasoning concludes that any abelian group of order \\( pq \\), where \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) are distinct primes, must be cyclic.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'let'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'let'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'let'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

In \\( S_4 \\), the Klein four-group \\( V_4 \\) is a well-known normal subgroup. This subgroup \\( V_4 \\) consists of the identity permutation and three double transpositions, such as:\n\\[\nV_4 = \\{ e, (12)(34), (13)(24), (14)(23) \\}\n\\]\nBeing normal means that for any permutation \\( \\sigma \\) in \\( S_4 \\), the conjugate \\( \\sigma V_4 \\sigma^{-1} \\) is still \\( V_4 \\).\n\nHowever, \\( V_4 \\) is not **characteristic** in \\( S_4 \\). A characteristic subgroup is one that is fixed by all automorphisms of the group, not just by conjugation. To see why \\( V_4 \\) is not characteristic, observe that \\( S_4 \\) has multiple Klein four-subgroups that are structurally identical but distinct within the group. These subgroups are related by automorphisms of \\( S_4 \\) that map one Klein four-subgroup to another.\n\nFor example, consider another Klein four-subgroup \\( V'_4 \\) in \\( S_4 \\) that is different from \\( V_4 \\). There exists an automorphism of \\( S_4 \\) that sends \\( V_4 \\) to \\( V'_4 \\). Since \\( V_4 \\) can be mapped to another subgroup by an automorphism, it is not uniquely determined by the group's structure alone. Therefore, \\( V_4 \\) is not fixed under all automorphisms of \\( S_4 \\), meaning it is not a characteristic subgroup.\n\nIn summary, \\( V_4 \\) serves as an example of a normal subgroup within \\( S_4 \\) that is not characteristic because there exist automorphisms of \\( S_4 \\) that can transform \\( V_4 \\) into other similar subgroups. This clearly shows that normality does not necessarily imply characteristicity.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'let'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'let'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'let'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

We want to show that within this group, there exists a normal Sylow \\( p \\)-subgroup for some prime number \\( p \\) that divides 56.\n\nFirst, notice that the number 56 can be factored into prime numbers as \\( 56 = 2^3 \\times 7 \\). This tells us that the primes dividing the order of \\( G \\) are 2 and 7.\n\nAccording to the Sylow theorems, for each prime divisor of the group order, there exists at least one corresponding Sylow subgroup. Specifically, \\( G \\) has Sylow 2-subgroups (subgroups of order \\( 2^3 = 8 \\)) and Sylow 7-subgroups (subgroups of order 7).\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n- \\( n_2 \\) as the number of Sylow 2-subgroups in \\( G \\),\n- \\( n_7 \\) as the number of Sylow 7-subgroups in \\( G \\).\n\nThe Sylow theorems provide us with important information about these numbers:\n1. The number of Sylow 2-subgroups \\( n_2 \\) must be an odd number and must divide 56. The only odd divisors of 56 are 1 and 7. Therefore, \\( n_2 \\) can be either 1 or 7.\n2. Similarly, the number of Sylow 7-subgroups \\( n_7 \\) must be congruent to 1 modulo 7 and must divide 56. The possible values satisfying these conditions are 1 and 8.\n\nIf either \\( n_2 = 1 \\) or \\( n_7 = 1 \\), then the corresponding Sylow subgroup is unique and, importantly, it must be a normal subgroup of \\( G \\). This is because having only one such subgroup means it is invariant under conjugation by any element of \\( G \\), which is the definition of a normal subgroup.\n\nSuppose, for the sake of contradiction, that both \\( n_2 \\) and \\( n_7 \\) are greater than 1. Specifically, assume \\( n_7 = 8 \\). Each Sylow 7-subgroup has exactly 6 non-identity elements (since each subgroup of order 7 is cyclic and contains 6 elements of order 7 plus the identity). If there are 8 such distinct Sylow 7-subgroups, and their intersections contain only the identity element, then these subgroups account for \\( 6 \\times 8 = 48 \\) distinct elements of \\( G \\).\n\nHowever, the entire group \\( G \\) has only 56 elements. After accounting for the 48 elements from the Sylow 7-subgroups and the identity element, there are only \\( 56 - 48 = 8 \\) elements left. But a Sylow 2-subgroup has exactly 8 elements, meaning all of these remaining elements must form a single Sylow 2-subgroup. This implies that there is only one Sylow 2-subgroup, so \\( n_2 = 1 \\).\n\nThis contradiction shows that our assumption that both \\( n_2 \\) and \\( n_7 \\) are greater than 1 cannot hold. Therefore, at least one of \\( n_2 \\) or \\( n_7 \\) must be equal to 1. This means that \\( G \\) has either a unique normal Sylow 2-subgroup or a unique normal Sylow 7-subgroup.\n\nIn conclusion, any group of order 56 must have a normal Sylow \\( p \\)-subgroup for some prime \\( p \\) dividing its order.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unsolved goals\nG : Type u_1\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : Group G\ninst\u271d : Fintype G\nhG : card G = 56\np : \u2115 := 2\nq : \u2115 := 7\nh1 : p.Prime\nh2 : q.Prime\n\u22a2 False\nunknown constant 'Sylow.normal_of_coprime'\nunknown constant 'Sylow.normal_of_coprime'\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

First, we factorize 351 to identify its prime components:\n\\[\n351 = 3^3 \\times 13\n\\]\nHere, the primes involved are 3 and 13. According to Sylow\u2019s theorems, for each prime divisor \\( p \\) of the group order, there exists at least one Sylow \\( p \\)-subgroup in \\( G \\). Moreover, the number of Sylow \\( p \\)-subgroups, denoted \\( n_p \\), must satisfy two conditions:\n1. \\( n_p \\) divides the order of the group divided by \\( p^k \\), where \\( p^k \\) is the highest power of \\( p \\) dividing the group order.\n2. \\( n_p \\equiv 1 \\mod p \\).\n\n**Analyzing Sylow 3-subgroups:**\nFor \\( p = 3 \\), the highest power dividing 351 is \\( 3^3 = 27 \\). The number of Sylow 3-subgroups, \\( n_3 \\), must divide \\( \\frac{351}{27} = 13 \\) and satisfy \\( n_3 \\equiv 1 \\mod 3 \\).

In this case, we have found a normal Sylow \\( p \\)-subgroup, and the proof is complete.\n- If \\( n_3 = 13 \\), there would be 13 distinct Sylow 3-subgroups. Each Sylow 3-subgroup has \\( 27 \\) elements, but since Sylow subgroups can only intersect at the identity in this context, having 13 such subgroups would account for \\( 13 \\times 26 = 338 \\) non-identity elements. However, the entire group has only \\( 351 - 1 = 350 \\) non-identity elements, making it impossible to accommodate 338 distinct elements without significant overlap, which contradicts the structure of Sylow subgroups. Therefore, \\( n_3 = 13 \\) is not feasible.\n\n**Analyzing Sylow 13-subgroups:**\nFor \\( p = 13 \\), the highest power dividing 351 is \\( 13^1 = 13 \\). The number of Sylow 13-subgroups, \\( n_{13} \\), must divide \\( \\frac{351}{13} = 27 \\) and satisfy \\( n_{13} \\equiv 1 \\mod 13 \\). The possible values for \\( n_{13} \\) are 1 or 27.\n\n- If \\( n_{13} = 1 \\), there is exactly one Sylow 13-subgroup, which is normal in \\( G \\). This gives us a normal Sylow \\( p \\)-subgroup, completing the proof.\n- If \\( n_{13} = 27 \\), there would be 27 Sylow 13-subgroups, each containing \\( 12 \\) non-identity elements. This would account for \\( 27 \\times 12 = 324 \\) non-identity elements. However, coupled with the Sylow 3-subgroups, this would exceed the total number of non-identity elements available in \\( G \\), leading to a contradiction. Therefore, \\( n_{13} = 27 \\) is impossible.\n\nSince both scenarios where \\( n_3 = 13 \\) and \\( n_{13} = 27 \\) lead to contradictions, the only feasible outcomes are \\( n_3 = 1 \\) or \\( n_{13} = 1 \\). In either case, there exists at least one Sylow \\( p \\)-subgroup that is normal in \\( G \\).\n\nThus, we conclude that any group of order 351 must have a normal Sylow \\( p \\)-subgroup for some prime \\( p \\) dividing its order.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown constant 'Sylow.normal_of_coprime'\nunknown constant 'Sylow.normal_of_coprime'\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

Sylow's theorems will help us analyze the number of Sylow \\( p \\)-subgroups for each of these primes.\n\nLet's focus on the Sylow 5-subgroups. Denote by \\( n_5 \\) the number of Sylow 5-subgroups in \\( G \\). According to Sylow's theorems, \\( n_5 \\) must satisfy two conditions:\n1. \\( n_5 \\) divides \\( \\frac{6545}{5} = 1309 \\).\n2. \\( n_5 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5} \\).\n\nThe divisors of 1309 are 1, 7, 11, 17, 77, 119, 187, and 1309.

Therefore, \\( n_5 \\) can be either 1 or 11.\n\n- **Case 1:** \\( n_5 = 1 \\)\n\n  If there is exactly one Sylow 5-subgroup, this subgroup must be normal in \\( G \\) (since it's the only one of its kind).

        "informal_proof": "# Informal Proof:\n\nLet\u2019s begin by considering the Sylow $p$-subgroup $P$ of the group $G$. Since $P$ is not only a Sylow $p$-subgroup but also **normal** in $G$, it possesses certain unique properties that we can leverage in our proof.\n\nFirstly, because $P$ is normal in $G$, it remains unchanged under conjugation by any element of $G$. This normality implies that $P$ is the **only** Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$. If there were another Sylow $p$-subgroup in $G$, normality would force it to coincide with $P$, ensuring uniqueness.\n\nNow, consider any subgroup $H$ of $G$. We are interested in the intersection $P \\cap H$. Since $P$ is a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$, its intersection with $H$ will be a $p$-subgroup of $H$. More importantly, because $P$ is normal in $G$, the intersection $P \\cap H$ inherits this normality within $H$. This means that $P \\cap H$ is a normal $p$-subgroup of $H$.\n\nTo show that $P \\cap H$ is a **Sylow $p$-subgroup** of $H$, we can apply the Sylow theorems within the context of $H$. The Sylow theorems tell us that all Sylow $p$-subgroups of $H$ are conjugate to each other within $H$. However, since $P$ is normal in the larger group $G$, and thus in $H$, the intersection $P \\cap H$ must be invariant under conjugation by elements of $H$. This invariance implies that there can be no other Sylow $p$-subgroups in $H$ aside from $P \\cap H$ itself.\n\nTherefore, $P \\cap H$ is not only a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $H$ but also the **unique** one. Its uniqueness stems from the normality of $P$ in $G$, which restricts any Sylow $p$-subgroup of $H$ to coincide with $P \\cap H$.\n\nIn summary, the normal Sylow $p$-subgroup $P$ of $G$ ensures that its intersection with any subgroup $H$ of $G$ yields a unique Sylow $p$-subgroup of $H$. This uniqueness is a direct consequence of the normality and maximality properties that define Sylow $p$-subgroups.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'apply' failed, failed to unify\n  ?P = ?Q\nwith\n  \u2191R = (H \u2293 \u2191P).subgroupOf H\nG : Type u_1\ninst\u271d\u00b2 : Group G\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : Fintype G\np : \u2115\nP : Sylow p G\nhP : (\u2191P).Normal\nH : Subgroup G\ninst\u271d : Fintype \u21a5H\nR : Sylow p \u21a5H\n\u22a2 \u2191R = (H \u2293 \u2191P).subgroupOf H\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'apply' failed, failed to unify\n  ?P = ?Q\nwith\n  \u2191R = (H \u2293 \u2191P).subgroupOf H\ncase left\nG : Type u_1\ninst\u271d\u00b2 : Group G\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : Fintype G\np : \u2115\nP : Sylow p G\nhP : (\u2191P).Normal\nH : Subgroup G\ninst\u271d : Fintype \u21a5H\nR : Sylow p \u21a5H\n\u22a2 \u2191R = (H \u2293 \u2191P).subgroupOf H\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown constant 'Sylow.mem_toSubgroup'\nrcases tactic failed: a\u271d : (\u2191R).toSubsemigroup.1 x is not an inductive datatype\ninvalid constructor \u27e8...\u27e9, expected type must be an inductive type \n  (\u2191R).toSubsemigroup.1 x\nPlease revise the proof.",

Then, by definition, there exists some nonzero polynomial \\( q(x) = b_m x^m + \\cdots + b_1 x + b_0 \\) in \\( R[x] \\) such that \\( p(x) q(x) = 0 \\).\n- Consider the multiplication \\( p(x) q(x) \\). When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of the resulting polynomial are combinations of the products of coefficients from \\( p(x) \\) and \\( q(x) \\).\n- For the entire product \\( p(x) q(x) \\) to be the zero polynomial, every coefficient in the resulting polynomial must be zero. In particular, the constant term of the product is \\( a_0 b_0 = 0 \\). However, this alone doesn't guarantee \\( b_0 \\) is zero.\n- To ensure that all coefficients cancel out appropriately, it's necessary that there exists at least one nonzero coefficient \\( b_j \\) in \\( q(x) \\) such that multiplying it by a corresponding \\( a_i \\) in \\( p(x) \\) results in zero. This implies that \\( a_i \\) must annihilate some nonzero \\( b_j \\) in \\( R \\).\n- Specifically, take the lowest degree term in \\( q(x) \\) with a nonzero coefficient, say \\( b_j x^j \\). Multiplying this term by \\( p(x) \\) and setting it to zero forces \\( a_i b_j = 0 \\) for some \\( i \\). Since \\( b_j \\) is nonzero, this means \\( a_i \\) must be a zero divisor in \\( R \\).\n- Letting \\( b = b_j \\), we then have \\( b p(x) = 0 \\) because each coefficient in \\( b p(x) \\) involves multiplying \\( b \\) with the corresponding coefficient in \\( p(x) \\), all of which result in zero.\n\n**2. If there exists a nonzero \\( b \\in R \\) such that \\( b p(x) = 0 \\), then \\( p(x) \\) is a zero divisor in \\( R[x] \\).**\n\n*Proof Steps:*\n- Suppose there exists a nonzero element \\( b \\in R \\) such that \\( b p(x) = 0 \\).\n- Consider the polynomial \\( q(x) = b \\), which is the constant polynomial in \\( R[x] \\).\n- Since \\( b \\) is nonzero and \\( b p(x) = 0 \\), this directly means that \\( p(x) \\) multiplied by the nonzero polynomial \\( q(x) = b \\) yields the zero polynomial.\n- By the definition of a zero divisor in \\( R[x] \\), this shows that \\( p(x) \\) is indeed a zero divisor because it annihilates the nonzero polynomial \\( q(x) \\).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nCombining both parts, we have established that \\( p(x) \\) is a zero divisor in \\( R[x] \\) if and only if there exists a nonzero element \\( b \\in R \\) such that \\( b p(x) = 0 \\).

Specifically, consider the sum:\n\\[\nS = 1 + a b + (a b)^2 + \\cdots + (a b)^{n-1}\n\\]\nWhen we multiply \\( S \\) by \\( 1 - a b \\), we get:\n\\[\nS \\cdot (1 - a b) = \\left(1 + a b + (a b)^2 + \\cdots + (a b)^{n-1}\\right) \\cdot (1 - a b)\n\\]\nExpanding this product, most terms cancel out in a telescoping manner:\n\\[\nS \\cdot (1 - a b) = 1 - (a b)^n\n\\]\nBut since \\( (a b)^n = 0 \\), this simplifies to:\n\\[\nS \\cdot (1 - a b) = 1\n\\]\nThis shows that \\( S \\) is indeed the inverse of \\( 1 - a b \\). Therefore, \\( 1 - a b \\) is a unit in \\( R \\).\n\nIn summary, by leveraging the nilpotency of \\( a \\) and constructing an explicit inverse using a finite sum, we have demonstrated that \\( 1 - a b \\) must be invertible in the ring \\( R \\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ':='; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ':='; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ':='; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

Here's how we can establish this:\n\n1. **Start with an Arbitrary Ideal:**\n   Consider any non-zero ideal \\( I \\) in \\( R \\). Since \\( I \\) is an ideal in an integral domain, it is non-empty and contains non-zero elements.\n\n2. **Finite Generation of Ideals:**\n   In an integral domain, every ideal can be generated by its elements. If \\( I \\) is finitely generated, say by elements \\( a_1, a_2, \\dotsc, a_n \\), then we can apply the first condition to these generators.\n\n3. **Applying Condition (i) \u2013 Existence of a GCD:**\n   According to condition (i), any two non-zero elements in \\( R \\) have a greatest common divisor (GCD) that can be expressed as a linear combination of those elements. Begin by finding the GCD of \\( a_1 \\) and \\( a_2 \\), say \\( d_1 = r_1 a_1 + s_1 a_2 \\). This \\( d_1 \\) divides both \\( a_1 \\) and \\( a_2 \\).\n\n4. **Iterative Process to Find a Single Generator:**\n   Next, take the GCD of \\( d_1 \\) and \\( a_3 \\), resulting in \\( d_2 = r_2 d_1 + s_2 a_3 \\). Continue this process iteratively:\n   \\[\n   d_3 = r_3 d_2 + s_3 a_4, \\quad \\dotsc, \\quad d_{n-1} = r_{n-1} d_{n-2} + s_{n-1} a_n\n   \\]\n   Eventually, this process yields an element \\( d \\) that is a GCD of all the generators \\( a_1, a_2, \\dotsc, a_n \\). Importantly, \\( d \\) can be expressed as a linear combination of the \\( a_i \\)'s.\n\n5. **Establishing \\( d \\) as a Generator for \\( I \\):**\n   Since \\( d \\) is a GCD of the generators, it divides each \\( a_i \\), meaning every generator is a multiple of \\( d \\). Therefore, every element of \\( I \\) is a multiple of \\( d \\), and thus \\( I \\) is contained within the principal ideal \\( (d) \\). Conversely, \\( d \\) is constructed as a combination of elements in \\( I \\), so \\( (d) \\) is contained within \\( I \\). Therefore, \\( I = (d) \\), showing that \\( I \\) is principal.\n\n6. **Ensuring the Process Terminates \u2013 Applying Condition (ii):**\n   Condition (ii) ensures that any descending sequence of elements where each divides the previous one eventually stabilizes up to a unit multiple. This guarantees that the iterative process of finding GCDs does not continue indefinitely without reaching a stable generator. In other words, it assures that the GCD process culminates in a specific element \\( d \\) that effectively generates the ideal.\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   Since every finitely generated ideal \\( I \\) in \\( R \\) can be expressed as \\( (d) \\) for some \\( d \\in R \\), and because \\( R \\) satisfies the necessary conditions to ensure this, it follows that \\( R \\) is a Principal Ideal Domain.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

To establish this, we'll demonstrate that none of these elements can be expressed as a product of two non-unit elements in \\( R \\).\n\n**1. Proving that \\( 2 \\) is irreducible in \\( R \\):**\n\nFirst, consider the element \\( 2 \\) in \\( R \\). Suppose, for contradiction, that \\( 2 \\) can be factored into two non-unit elements in \\( R \\), say \\( 2 = ab \\), where neither \\( a \\) nor \\( b \\) is a unit.\n\nTo analyze this, we use the concept of the *norm*. The norm of an element \\( a + b\\sqrt{-n} \\) in \\( R \\) is defined as \\( N(a + b\\sqrt{-n}) = a^2 + nb^2 \\). For the element \\( 2 \\), the norm is \\( N(2) = 4 \\).\n\nIf \\( 2 = ab \\), then \\( N(2) = N(a)N(b) = 4 \\). Since neither \\( a \\) nor \\( b \\) is a unit, their norms \\( N(a) \\) and \\( N(b) \\) must be integers greater than 1 that multiply to 4. The only possibilities are \\( N(a) = 2 \\) and \\( N(b) = 2 \\).\n\nHowever, in \\( R \\), there are no elements with norm 2 because \\( a^2 + nb^2 = 2 \\) would require \\( b = 0 \\) (since \\( n > 3 \\)) and \\( a^2 = 2 \\), which has no integer solutions. This contradiction implies that \\( 2 \\) cannot be factored into non-unit elements in \\( R \\), and thus, \\( 2 \\) is irreducible.\n\n**2. Proving that \\( \\sqrt{-n} \\) is irreducible in \\( R \\):**\n\nNext, consider \\( \\sqrt{-n} \\) in \\( R \\). Suppose \\( \\sqrt{-n} \\) can be written as a product \\( \\sqrt{-n} = ab \\), where neither \\( a \\) nor \\( b \\) is a unit.\n\nTaking norms, we have \\( N(\\sqrt{-n}) = n \\). Therefore, \\( N(a)N(b) = n \\). Since \\( n \\) is squarefree and greater than 3, the only way to express \\( n \\) as a product of two positive integers is \\( 1 \\times n \\). This implies that one of the factors, say \\( a \\), must have a norm of 1, making it a unit. This contradicts our assumption that neither \\( a \\) nor \\( b \\) is a unit. Hence, \\( \\sqrt{-n} \\) cannot be factored into non-unit elements in \\( R \\), and it is irreducible.\n\n**3. Proving that \\( 1 + \\sqrt{-n} \\) is irreducible in \\( R \\):**\n\nFinally, consider the element \\( 1 + \\sqrt{-n} \\) in \\( R \\). Assume, for contradiction, that \\( 1 + \\sqrt{-n} = ab \\), where neither \\( a \\) nor \\( b \\) is a unit.\n\nCalculating the norm, we find \\( N(1 + \\sqrt{-n}) = 1^2 + n(1)^2 = 1 + n \\). Since \\( n > 3 \\), \\( N(1 + \\sqrt{-n}) = n + 1 \\) is greater than 4 and is also squarefree because \\( n \\) is squarefree.\n\nIf \\( 1 + \\sqrt{-n} = ab \\), then \\( N(a)N(b) = n + 1 \\). Given that \\( n + 1 \\) is squarefree and greater than 4, the only possible factorizations of \\( n + 1 \\) are into primes or into 1 and itself. However, for \\( N(a) \\) and \\( N(b) \\) to both be greater than 1 and multiply to \\( n + 1 \\), there must exist elements in \\( R \\) with norm equal to a prime dividing \\( n + 1 \\). Given that \\( n + 1 \\) is squarefree, and considering the structure of \\( R \\), no such elements with these norms exist without one of them being a unit. This contradiction shows that \\( 1 + \\sqrt{-n} \\) cannot be factored into non-unit elements in \\( R \\), and thus, it is irreducible.\n\nIn conclusion, within the ring \\( \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-n}] \\) for a squarefree integer \\( n > 3 \\), the elements \\( 2 \\), \\( \\sqrt{-n} \\), and \\( 1 + \\sqrt{-n} \\) are indeed irreducible.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'apply' failed, failed to unify\n  @Irreducible ?m.636 MonoidWithZero.toMonoid ?m.669\nwith\n  @Irreducible (\u2124\u221a(-n)) Zsqrtd.instMonoid 2\ncase left\nn : \u2124\nhn0 : n > 3\nhn1 : Squarefree n\n\u22a2 Irreducible 2\ntactic 'apply' failed, failed to unify\n  @Irreducible ?m.1728 MonoidWithZero.toMonoid ?m.1761\nwith\n  @Irreducible (\u2124\u221a(-n)) Zsqrtd.instMonoid { re := 0, im := 1 }\ncase right.left\nn : \u2124\nhn0 : n > 3\nhn1 : Squarefree n\n\u22a2 Irreducible { re := 0, im := 1 }\ntactic 'apply' failed, failed to unify\n  @Irreducible ?m.1839 MonoidWithZero.toMonoid ?m.1872\nwith\n  @Irreducible (\u2124\u221a(-n)) Zsqrtd.instMonoid (1 + { re := 0, im := 1 })\ncase right.right\nn : \u2124\nhn0 : n > 3\nhn1 : Squarefree n\n\u22a2 Irreducible (1 + { re := 0, im := 1 })\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: \nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: \nPlease revise the proof.",

We aim to show that when q is a prime integer congruent to 3 modulo 4 (i.e., q \u2261 3\u202fmod\u202f4), the quotient ring \u2124[i]/(q) forms a field with exactly q\u00b2 elements.\n\n**1. Understanding the Structure of \u2124[i]:**\n\u2124[i] is an extension of the ordinary integers \u2124, incorporating the imaginary unit i. This ring has a two-dimensional lattice structure over \u2124, meaning each element can be uniquely represented by a pair of integers (a, b).\n\n**2. The Nature of the Ideal (q) in \u2124[i]:**\nAn ideal in a ring is a special subset that allows for the construction of quotient rings. Here, (q) represents the ideal generated by the prime integer q in \u2124[i]. Since q is prime in \u2124 and q \u2261 3 mod\u202f4, it retains its \"primeness\" in the larger ring \u2124[i]. Specifically, in \u2124[i], primes that are 3 modulo 4 do not factor into smaller Gaussian integers, making (q) a prime ideal.\n\n**3. Principal Ideal Domain and Maximal Ideals:**\n\u2124[i] is a Principal Ideal Domain (PID), meaning every ideal is generated by a single element. In PIDs, a prime ideal is also a maximal ideal. Since (q) is prime in \u2124[i], it follows that (q) is a maximal ideal. Maximal ideals are important because the quotient of a ring by a maximal ideal yields a field.\n\n**4. Forming the Quotient Ring \u2124[i]/(q):**\nWhen we take the quotient of \u2124[i] by the ideal (q), we essentially consider all Gaussian integers modulo q. Because (q) is a maximal ideal, \u2124[i]/(q) is guaranteed to be a field. This means that every non-zero element in \u2124[i]/(q) has a multiplicative inverse, satisfying one of the key properties of a field.\n\n**5. Determining the Number of Elements in \u2124[i]/(q):**\nSince \u2124[i] is two-dimensional over \u2124, when we reduce modulo q, each coordinate (both the real part a and the imaginary part b) can independently take any of the q possible residues (from 0 to q-1). Therefore, there are q choices for a and q choices for b, resulting in a total of q \u00d7 q = q\u00b2 distinct elements in the quotient ring \u2124[i]/(q).\n\n**6. Conclusion:**\nPutting it all together, for a prime integer q \u2261 3 mod\u202f4, the ideal (q) in \u2124[i] is maximal, making \u2124[i]/(q) a field. Moreover, the structure of \u2124[i] ensures that this field contains exactly q\u00b2 elements. Thus, we have shown that \u2124[i]/(q) is indeed a field with q\u00b2 elements when q is a prime congruent to 3 modulo 4.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

This means that within each pair of variables \\( (x_{2k-1}, x_{2k}) \\) for \\( k = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots \\), the product of the two variables is zero. Such relations impose a specific structure on the ring, essentially creating \"pairs\" of variables that interact in a controlled way.\n\nNext, consider the integer ring \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\), which is well-known to have infinitely many prime ideals, each corresponding to a distinct prime number. For each prime number \\( p \\), the ideal \\( (p) \\) is a prime ideal in \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\).\n\nWe can leverage this fact to construct distinct minimal prime ideals in \\( R \\). For each prime \\( p \\), define an ideal \\( P_p \\) in \\( R \\) by taking:\n\\[\nP_p = (p, x_{1}, x_{3}, x_{5}, \\ldots)\n\\]\nHere, \\( P_p \\) is generated by the prime number \\( p \\) and all the odd-indexed variables \\( x_{1}, x_{3}, x_{5}, \\ldots \\). \n\nTo verify that \\( P_p \\) is indeed a prime ideal, consider the quotient ring \\( R / P_p \\). In this quotient, all the odd-indexed variables are set to zero, and we are effectively left with the ring \\( \\mathbb{Z}/(p)\\left[x_{2}, x_{4}, x_{6}, \\ldots\\right] \\). Since \\( \\mathbb{Z}/(p) \\) is an integral domain (because \\( p \\) is prime), and the polynomial ring over an integral domain is also an integral domain, \\( R / P_p \\) is an integral domain. This confirms that \\( P_p \\) is a prime ideal.\n\nFurthermore, each \\( P_p \\) is minimal because there is no smaller prime ideal contained within it. Different primes \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) in \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) lead to distinct ideals \\( P_p \\) and \\( P_q \\) in \\( R \\), ensuring that these minimal prime ideals are all distinct from one another.\n\nSince there are infinitely many prime numbers \\( p \\) in \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\), it follows that there are infinitely many such minimal prime ideals \\( P_p \\) in \\( R \\).

Therefore, the polynomial cannot be factored into the product of two quadratic polynomials with integer coefficients.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nHaving exhausted all possibilities for factoring the polynomial into linear and quadratic factors with integer coefficients and finding no valid factorizations, we conclude that the polynomial \\( x^4 + 4x^3 + 6x^2 + 2x + 1 \\) is irreducible in \\( \\mathbb{Z}[x] \\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'apply' failed, failed to unify\n  Irreducible ?p \u2194 \u2200 (f g : ?R[X]), f.Monic \u2192 g.Monic \u2192 f * g = ?p \u2192 f = 1 \u2228 g = 1\nwith\n  Irreducible (X ^ 4 + 4 * X ^ 3 + 6 * X ^ 2 + 2 * X + 1)\n\u22a2 Irreducible (X ^ 4 + 4 * X ^ 3 + 6 * X ^ 2 + 2 * X + 1)\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'apply' failed, failed to unify\n  Irreducible ?p \u2194 \u2200 (f g : ?R[X]), f.Monic \u2192 g.Monic \u2192 f * g = ?p \u2192 f = 1 \u2228 g = 1\nwith\n  Irreducible (X ^ 4 + 4 * X ^ 3 + 6 * X ^ 2 + 2 * X + 1)\n\u22a2 Irreducible (X ^ 4 + 4 * X ^ 3 + 6 * X ^ 2 + 2 * X + 1)\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'apply' failed, failed to unify\n  Irreducible ?p \u2194 \u2200 (f g : ?R[X]), f.Monic \u2192 g.Monic \u2192 f * g = ?p \u2192 f = 1 \u2228 g = 1\nwith\n  Irreducible (X ^ 4 + 4 * X ^ 3 + 6 * X ^ 2 + 2 * X + 1)\n\u22a2 Irreducible (X ^ 4 + 4 * X ^ 3 + 6 * X ^ 2 + 2 * X + 1)\nPlease revise the proof.",

This means we can express it as a product of two linear polynomials with coefficients in \\( \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{2}] \\). Let's suppose:\n\\[\nx^{2} - \\sqrt{2} = (x + a)(x + b)\n\\]\nwhere \\( a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{2}] \\).\n\n**Expanding the right-hand side**, we get:\n\\[\nx^{2} + (a + b)x + ab = x^{2} - \\sqrt{2}\n\\]\nBy comparing coefficients, we derive two equations:\n1. \\( a + b = 0 \\) (the coefficient of \\( x \\) must be zero)\n2. \\( ab = -\\sqrt{2} \\) (the constant term)\n\nFrom the first equation, we find that \\( b = -a \\). Plugging this into the second equation gives:\n\\[\na(-a) = -a^{2} = -\\sqrt{2} \\implies a^{2} = \\sqrt{2}\n\\]\nNow, let's examine what \\( a \\) must be. Since \\( a \\in \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{2}] \\), it can be written in the form \\( a = m + n\\sqrt{2} \\), where \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are integers. Squaring \\( a \\) gives:\n\\[\na^{2} = (m + n\\sqrt{2})^{2} = m^{2} + 2n^{2} + 2mn\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\nSetting this equal to \\( \\sqrt{2} \\), we obtain:\n\\[\nm^{2} + 2n^{2} + 2mn\\sqrt{2} = \\sqrt{2}\n\\]\nFor these two expressions to be equal, the coefficients of like terms must match. Therefore, we have two equations:\n1. \\( m^{2} + 2n^{2} = 0 \\)\n2. \\( 2mn = 1 \\)\n\nLooking at the first equation, \\( m^{2} + 2n^{2} = 0 \\), since squares of integers are non-negative, the only solution is \\( m = 0 \\) and \\( n = 0 \\). However, substituting \\( m = 0 \\) and \\( n = 0 \\) into the second equation \\( 2mn = 1 \\) yields \\( 0 = 1 \\), which is a contradiction.\n\n**This contradiction implies that our initial assumption is false.** Therefore, the polynomial \\( x^{2} - \\sqrt{2} \\) cannot be factored into the product of two non-unit linear polynomials in \\( \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{2}] \\). \n\nSince no such factorization exists, \\( x^{2} - \\sqrt{2} \\) is irreducible over \\( \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{2}] \\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'exists_irreducible_and_factor'\nrcases tactic failed: x\u271d : ?m.4569 is not an inductive datatype\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'exists_irreducible_and_factor'\nrcases tactic failed: x\u271d : ?m.4569 is not an inductive datatype\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'exists_irreducible_and_factor'\nrcases tactic failed: x\u271d : ?m.4569 is not an inductive datatype\nPlease revise the proof.",

Since \\( \\mathbb{R} \\) is uncountably infinite and \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\) is countably infinite, the dimension of \\( \\mathbb{R} \\) as a \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\)-vector space is uncountably infinite.\n\n2. **Dimensions of \\( \\mathbb{R} \\) and \\( \\mathbb{R}^n \\):**\n   - The dimension of \\( \\mathbb{R}^n \\) over \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\) is also uncountably infinite. This is because finite products of \\( \\mathbb{R} \\) do not change the uncountable nature of the basis required over \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\).\n   - Specifically, even though \\( \\mathbb{R}^n \\) has \\( n \\) components, each component contributes an uncountable dimension, and combining them still results in an uncountable dimension.\n\n3. **Isomorphism Based on Equal Dimensions:**\n   - In linear algebra, two vector spaces over the same field are isomorphic if and only if they have the same dimension.\n   - Since both \\( \\mathbb{R} \\) and \\( \\mathbb{R}^n \\) have the same uncountably infinite dimension over \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\), there exists a bijective linear transformation (isomorphism) between them.\n\n4. **Constructing the Isomorphism:**\n   - While an explicit construction of such an isomorphism can be complex due to the uncountable nature of the spaces, the existence is guaranteed by the dimension argument.\n   - Essentially, we can pair each element of \\( \\mathbb{R}^n \\) with a unique element of \\( \\mathbb{R} \\) in a way that preserves vector addition and scalar multiplication by rationals.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Therefore, based on the fact that both \\( \\mathbb{R} \\) and \\( \\mathbb{R}^n \\) are \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\)-vector spaces of the same (uncountably infinite) dimension, they are isomorphic as vector spaces over \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\).\n   - This means there exists a one-to-one correspondence between \\( \\mathbb{R}^n \\) and \\( \\mathbb{R} \\) that preserves the vector space structure defined by addition and scalar multiplication with rational numbers.\n\nHence, for every positive integer \\( n \\), \\( \\mathbb{R}^n \\) is isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{R} \\) as vector spaces over \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: unexpected token 'def'; expected term\nfailed to synthesize\n  Fintype \u03b9\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\ntypeclass instance problem is stuck, it is often due to metavariables\n  Fintype ?m.6585\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: \nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown constant 'Fintype.linearEquivOfCardEq'\nPlease revise the proof.",

Similarly, when \\(U = X\\), \\(X - U = \\emptyset\\), which is also permitted. Thus, \\(\\emptyset\\) and \\(X\\) are both included in \\(\\mathcal{T}_\\infty\\).\n\n2. **Closure Under Finite Intersections:**\n   - Consider two sets \\(U\\) and \\(V\\) in \\(\\mathcal{T}_\\infty\\). Their complements \\(X - U\\) and \\(X - V\\) are either infinite, empty, or the entire set \\(X\\). The intersection \\(U \\cap V\\) has a complement \\(X - (U \\cap V) = (X - U) \\cup (X - V)\\).

Therefore, \\(U \\cap V\\) is also in \\(\\mathcal{T}_\\infty\\), satisfying closure under finite intersections.\n\n3. **Closure Under Arbitrary Unions:**\n   - This is where the collection \\(\\mathcal{T}_\\infty\\) fails to satisfy the topology axioms.

The complement of this union is \\(X - U = \\bigcap_{i \\in I} (X - U_i)\\).\n     - If each \\(X - U_i\\) is infinite, their intersection \\(X - U\\) could potentially be finite. For example, imagine each \\(U_i\\) omits only a distinct single integer from \\(X = \\mathbb{Z}\\). The union of all such \\(U_i\\) would omit no integers, making \\(X - U = \\emptyset\\), which is allowed. However, more generally, it's possible for \\(X - U\\) to be a finite set that is neither empty nor the entire space, violating the condition for \\(\\mathcal{T}_\\infty\\).\n     - Therefore, the arbitrary union \\(U\\) does not necessarily belong to \\(\\mathcal{T}_\\infty\\), as its complement might be finite and non-empty, which is not permitted.\n\nSince \\(\\mathcal{T}_\\infty\\) fails to be closed under arbitrary unions, it does not satisfy all the necessary axioms of a topology.

Understanding the Topology Generated by a Subbasis:**\n\nFirst, recall that a subbasis $\\mathcal{A}$ for a topology on $X$ is a collection of subsets of $X$ such that the finite intersections of elements of $\\mathcal{A}$ form a basis for the topology. Specifically, the topology generated by $\\mathcal{A}$, denoted $\\tau_{\\mathcal{A}}$, consists of all possible unions of these finite intersections. This means that every open set in $\\tau_{\\mathcal{A}}$ can be expressed as a union of finite intersections of elements from $\\mathcal{A}$.\n\n**2. Establishing the Intersection of All Topologies Containing $\\mathcal{A}$:**\n\nNext, consider all topologies on $X$ that contain $\\mathcal{A}$. Let's denote the collection of these topologies as $\\mathcal{T}$. The intersection of all topologies in $\\mathcal{T}$, say $\\bigcap \\mathcal{T}$, is itself a topology on $X$. This is because the intersection of any collection of topologies satisfies the axioms of a topology: it contains the whole set and the empty set, and it is closed under arbitrary unions and finite intersections.\n\n**3. Showing Equality of the Two Topologies:**\n\nNow, we need to show that $\\tau_{\\mathcal{A}}$ is equal to $\\bigcap \\mathcal{T}$.\n\n- **$\\tau_{\\mathcal{A}} \\subseteq \\bigcap \\mathcal{T}$:** Since $\\tau_{\\mathcal{A}}$ is the smallest topology containing $\\mathcal{A}$ (by definition of being generated by $\\mathcal{A}$), it must be contained within every topology that contains $\\mathcal{A}$. Therefore, every open set in $\\tau_{\\mathcal{A}}$ is also in each topology in $\\mathcal{T}$, and hence in their intersection.\n\n- **$\\bigcap \\mathcal{T} \\subseteq \\tau_{\\mathcal{A}}$:** Conversely, any topology that contains $\\mathcal{A}$ must also contain all finite intersections of elements of $\\mathcal{A}$ and arbitrary unions of these intersections (since topologies are closed under these operations). Therefore, every open set in $\\bigcap \\mathcal{T}$, being open in all topologies that contain $\\mathcal{A}$, must also be expressible as a union of finite intersections of elements from $\\mathcal{A}$. This means that every open set in $\\bigcap \\mathcal{T}$ is already in $\\tau_{\\mathcal{A}}$.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nSince we've established both inclusions, it follows that $\\tau_{\\mathcal{A}}$ is exactly the intersection of all topologies on $X$ that contain the subbasis $\\mathcal{A}$. In other words, the topology generated by the subbasis $\\mathcal{A}$ is the smallest topology containing $\\mathcal{A}$, precisely captured by the intersection of all such topologies.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

Verifying the Basis Criteria:**\n\nConsider an arbitrary open set \\(U\\) in \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\) and a point \\((x, y) \\in U\\). Since \\(U\\) is open in the Euclidean topology, there exists an open Euclidean neighborhood around \\((x, y)\\) completely contained within \\(U\\).

Here's how we achieve that:\n\n- **Finding Rational Boundaries for \\(x\\):** Since the rationals are dense in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\), there exists a rational number \\(a\\) such that \\(x - \\epsilon_x < a < x\\), and another rational number \\(b\\) such that \\(x < b < x + \\epsilon_x\\).\n\n- **Finding Rational Boundaries for \\(y\\):** Similarly, there exists a rational number \\(c\\) such that \\(y - \\epsilon_y < c < y\\), and another rational number \\(d\\) such that \\(y < d < y + \\epsilon_y\\).\n\nWith these rational numbers \\(a, b, c, d\\), the open rectangle \\((a, b) \\times (c, d)\\) is an element of \\(\\mathcal{B}\\). Moreover, this rectangle contains the point \\((x, y)\\) and is entirely contained within the original neighborhood \\((x - \\epsilon_x, x + \\epsilon_x) \\times (y - \\epsilon_y, y + \\epsilon_y)\\), which itself is within \\(U\\). Therefore, for every point in \\(U\\), there exists a basis element from \\(\\mathcal{B}\\) that contains the point and fits inside \\(U\\).\n\n**2. Establishing Countability:**\n\nEach basis element in \\(\\mathcal{B}\\) is determined by four rational numbers: \\(a, b, c, d\\), with the conditions \\(a < b\\) and \\(c < d\\). Since the set of rational numbers \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) is countable, and the Cartesian product of countable sets is also countable, the set \\(\\mathbb{Q} \\times \\mathbb{Q} \\times \\mathbb{Q} \\times \\mathbb{Q}\\) is countable.\n\nFurthermore, the conditions \\(a < b\\) and \\(c < d\\) simply restrict this countable set to a subset where these inequalities hold, which remains countable. Therefore, the collection \\(\\mathcal{B}\\), being a subset of a countable set, is itself countable.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nSince \\(\\mathcal{B}\\) satisfies both the basis criteria for the Euclidean topology on \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\) and is countable, we conclude that \\(\\mathcal{B}\\) is indeed a countable basis for \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: unexpected token ','; expected '\u21a6', '=>'\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unexpected token ','; expected '\u21a6', '=>'\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unexpected token ','; expected '\u21a6', '=>'\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

Several conditions must be met for a space to be metrizable, including:\n1. **First-Countability:** Every point has a countable local base (a countable collection of open sets that can approximate any neighborhood of the point).\n2. **Second-Countability:** The entire space has a countable base for its topology.\n3. **Normality and Hausdorff Property:** The space must be normal (any two disjoint closed sets can be separated by neighborhoods) and Hausdorff (any two distinct points have disjoint neighborhoods).\n4. **Paracompactness and Urysohn's Metrization Theorem:** These are more advanced conditions that often apply in proving metrizability.\n\n**Why \\(\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}\\) with Dictionary Order is Not Metrizable:**\n\n1. **Lack of Second-Countability:**\n   While \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) with the usual topology is second-countable, \\(\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}\\) with the dictionary order topology does not inherit this property. The dictionary order creates \"longer\" intervals and more intricate neighborhood structures that cannot be captured with a countable basis. This complexity means there's no countable collection of open sets that can serve as a basis for all open sets in the space.\n\n2. **Failure of First-Countability:**\n   In the dictionary order topology, certain points do not have a countable local base. For instance, consider a point \\((a, b)\\) in \\(\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}\\). Any neighborhood around \\((a, b)\\) in the dictionary order topology must account for points that are \"immediately next\" in the lex order, leading to uncountably many directions from which you can approach \\((a, b)\\). This uncountable complexity prevents the existence of a countable local base.\n\n3. **Non-Existence of a Compatible Metric:**\n   Since the space lacks second-countability and first-countability, it cannot satisfy the conditions required by Urysohn's Metrization Theorem, which provides criteria for when a topological space is metrizable. Without these countability conditions, no metric can adequately describe the open sets of the dictionary order topology on \\(\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}\\).\n\n4. **Comparison with Product Topology:**\n   It's worth noting that \\(\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}\\) with the usual product (Euclidean) topology is metrizable because it inherits second-countability and first-countability from \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). However, the dictionary order topology fundamentally differs from the product topology, leading to the failure of these essential properties for metrizability.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nGiven that \\(\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}\\) with the dictionary order topology does not satisfy key metrizability conditions like second-countability and first-countability, we conclude that it is not a metrizable space.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unexpected end of input\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unexpected end of input\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unexpected end of input\nPlease revise the proof.",

Specifically:\n   - If \\( x = 0 \\), then \\( f_n(0) = 0^n = 0 \\) for all \\( n \\).\n   - For any \\( x \\) such that \\( 0 < x < 1 \\), \\( f_n(x) = x^n \\) decreases towards 0 as \\( n \\) increases.\n   \n   However, at the endpoint \\( x = 1 \\), \\( f_n(1) = 1^n = 1 \\) for all \\( n \\).\n\n   Therefore, the pointwise limit function \\( f(x) \\) is defined as:\n   \\[\n   f(x) = \n   \\begin{cases}\n   0 & \\text{if } 0 \\leq x < 1, \\\\\n   1 & \\text{if } x = 1.\n   \\end{cases}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Uniform Convergence:**\n\n   Uniform convergence requires that the functions \\( f_n(x) \\) get uniformly close to the limit function \\( f(x) \\) across the entire interval \\([0, 1]\\) as \\( n \\) increases. In other words, for every \\( \\varepsilon > 0 \\), there should exist an integer \\( N \\) such that for all \\( n \\geq N \\) and for all \\( x \\) in \\([0, 1]\\), the inequality \\( |f_n(x) - f(x)| < \\varepsilon \\) holds.\n\n3. **Analyzing Uniform Convergence:**\n\n   Let's examine the difference \\( |f_n(x) - f(x)| \\):\n   - For \\( x = 1 \\), \\( |f_n(1) - f(1)| = |1 - 1| = 0 \\), which satisfies the condition for any \\( n \\).\n   - For \\( 0 \\leq x < 1 \\), \\( |f_n(x) - f(x)| = |x^n - 0| = x^n \\). As \\( n \\) increases, \\( x^n \\) decreases towards 0 for each fixed \\( x \\) in \\([0, 1)\\).\n\n   However, to achieve uniform convergence, the convergence \\( x^n \\to 0 \\) must happen uniformly across all \\( x \\) in \\([0, 1)\\). This means the rate at which \\( x^n \\) approaches 0 should be the same for every \\( x \\) in the interval.\n\n4. **Identifying the Problem with Uniform Convergence:**\n\n   Consider values of \\( x \\) very close to 1, such as \\( x = 1 - \\frac{1}{n} \\). For these \\( x \\), \\( x^n = \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{n}\\right)^n \\). As \\( n \\) grows, \\( \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{n}\\right)^n \\) approaches \\( \\frac{1}{e} \\), which is approximately 0.3679. This means that no matter how large \\( n \\) becomes, there are always points \\( x \\) near 1 where \\( x^n \\) remains significantly away from 0.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n\n   Since for any \\( n \\), there exists an \\( x \\) in \\([0, 1)\\) (specifically, values of \\( x \\) approaching 1) where \\( x^n \\) does not get arbitrarily close to 0, the supremum \\( \\sup_{x \\in [0,1]} |f_n(x) - f(x)| \\) remains bounded away from 0. In fact, it approaches 1 as \\( x \\) approaches 1 from below.\n\n   Therefore, the convergence of \\( f_n(x) = x^n \\) to \\( f(x) \\) is not uniform on the interval \\([0, 1]\\).",

Here's how the existence of \\( f \\) facilitates this:\n   \n   - Suppose \\( p^{-1}(U) \\) is open in \\( X \\).\n   - Consider the map \\( f: Y \\rightarrow X \\). Since \\( f \\) is continuous and \\( p \\circ f = \\text{id}_Y \\), applying \\( f \\) to \\( U \\) gives \\( f(U) \\), which is a subset of \\( X \\).\n   - Now, observe that \\( p(f(U)) = \\text{id}_Y(U) = U \\). This is because for each \\( y \\) in \\( U \\), \\( p(f(y)) = y \\).\n   - Since \\( f \\) is continuous and \\( p^{-1}(U) \\) is open, the image \\( f(U) \\) lies entirely within \\( p^{-1}(U) \\), which is open. Therefore, \\( f(U) \\) is open in \\( X \\) because it's the image of an open set under a continuous map.\n   - Finally, since \\( p \\) maps the open set \\( f(U) \\) onto \\( U \\) and \\( p \\) is continuous and surjective, this ensures that \\( U \\) must be open in \\( Y \\).\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   \n   Combining these observations:\n   \n   - We have that \\( p \\) is continuous and surjective.\n   - A subset \\( U \\) of \\( Y \\) is open **if and only if** \\( p^{-1}(U) \\) is open in \\( X \\).\n\n   Therefore, \\( p \\) satisfies the criteria for being a **quotient map**.\n\nThis reasoning leverages the existence of the continuous section \\( f \\) to bridge the openness of sets between \\( X \\) and \\( Y \\), ensuring that the topology on \\( Y \\) is precisely the quotient topology induced by \\( p \\).

This new function \\( g \\) inherits the continuity from \\( f \\) because it's formed by subtracting the identity function \\( x \\) (which is continuous) from \\( f(x) \\). Therefore, \\( g \\) is continuous on the entire interval \\([0, 1]\\).\n\nNow, evaluate \\( g \\) at the endpoints:\n\n- **At \\( x = 0 \\):**\n  \\[\n  g(0) = f(0) - 0 = f(0) \\geq 0\n  \\]\n  \n- **At \\( x = 1 \\):**\n  \\[\n  g(1) = f(1) - 1 \\leq 0\n  \\]\n\nSo, \\( g(0) \\) is non-negative, and \\( g(1) \\) is non-positive. Since \\( g \\) is continuous and changes sign over the interval \\([0, 1]\\), the Intermediate Value Theorem tells us that there must be some point \\( c \\) in \\([0, 1]\\) where \\( g(c) = 0 \\).\n\nAt this point \\( c \\), we have:\n\\[\ng(c) = f(c) - c = 0 \\implies f(c) = c\n\\]\nThus, \\( c \\) is the fixed point of \\( f \\) in the interval \\([0, 1]\\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'let'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'let'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'let'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

Our goal is to show that \\( C \\) is a normal subgroup of \\( G \\). We can achieve this by following two main steps: first, proving that \\( C \\) is a subgroup of \\( G \\), and second, demonstrating that \\( C \\) is normal in \\( G \\).\n\n**1. \\( C \\) is a Subgroup of \\( G \\):**\n\n- **Identity Element:** By definition, the connected component \\( C \\) contains the identity element \\( e \\) of \\( G \\).\n\n- **Closure Under Group Operation:** Take any two elements \\( c_1 \\) and \\( c_2 \\) in \\( C \\). Since \\( G \\) is a topological group, the group operation (multiplication) is continuous. The image of the connected set \\( C \\times C \\) under the multiplication map is connected. Moreover, because \\( C \\) contains \\( e \\) and is connected, the product \\( c_1 c_2 \\) must also lie in \\( C \\). This shows that \\( C \\) is closed under the group operation.\n\n- **Closure Under Inverses:** Similarly, the inversion map in a topological group is continuous. The image of \\( C \\) under inversion is connected and contains \\( e \\), so the inverse \\( c^{-1} \\) of any \\( c \\in C \\) also lies in \\( C \\).\n\nHaving satisfied these conditions, \\( C \\) is indeed a subgroup of \\( G \\).\n\n**2. \\( C \\) is a Normal Subgroup of \\( G \\):**\n\nTo prove that \\( C \\) is normal, we need to show that it is invariant under conjugation by any element of \\( G \\). In other words, for any \\( g \\in G \\) and any \\( c \\in C \\), the element \\( g c g^{-1} \\) should also be in \\( C \\).\n\n- **Conjugation as a Homeomorphism:** The map that sends \\( c \\) to \\( g c g^{-1} \\) is an automorphism of \\( G \\), and since \\( G \\) is a topological group, this map is a homeomorphism. Homes preserve connectedness, so the image of the connected set \\( C \\) under this conjugation map remains connected.\n\n- **Containment of the Identity:** Since \\( C \\) contains \\( e \\), and \\( g e g^{-1} = e \\), the conjugated set still contains the identity element \\( e \\).\n\n- **Connectedness and Identity:** Because the image of \\( C \\) under conjugation is connected and contains \\( e \\), it must lie entirely within \\( C \\). Therefore, \\( g c g^{-1} \\in C \\) for all \\( g \\in G \\) and \\( c \\in C \\).\n\nSince \\( C \\) is closed under conjugation by any element of \\( G \\), it follows that \\( C \\) is a normal subgroup of \\( G \\).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy first establishing that \\( C \\) is a subgroup through closure under group operations and inverses, and then showing that \\( C \\) remains unchanged under conjugation by any element of \\( G \\), we have demonstrated that \\( C \\) is a normal subgroup of the topological group \\( G \\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'is_normal_subgroup_of_connected_component'\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'is_normal_subgroup_of_connected_component'\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'is_normal_subgroup_of_connected_component'\nPlease revise the proof.",

Countably Compact \\( \\Rightarrow \\) Limit Point Compact:**\n\nAssume \\( X \\) is countably compact. Suppose, for contradiction, that there exists an infinite subset \\( A \\subseteq X \\) with no limit points in \\( X \\). In a \\( T_1 \\) space, single points are closed, so each point \\( a \\in A \\) is closed. Therefore, the complements \\( X \\setminus \\{a\\} \\) are open sets.\n\nConsider the collection of open sets \\( \\{ X \\setminus \\{a\\} \\mid a \\in A \\} \\). This is a countable open cover of \\( X \\) because every point in \\( X \\) is either in \\( X \\setminus \\{a\\} \\) for some \\( a \\) or is one of the points in \\( A \\). However, since \\( A \\) is infinite and has no limit points, no finite subcollection of these open sets can cover \\( X \\). This contradicts the assumption that \\( X \\) is countably compact. Hence, every infinite subset of \\( X \\) must have a limit point, making \\( X \\) limit point compact.\n\n**2. Limit Point Compact \\( \\Rightarrow \\) Countably Compact (in a \\( T_1 \\) space):**\n\nNow, assume \\( X \\) is a \\( T_1 \\) space that is limit point compact. We need to show that every countable open cover of \\( X \\) has a finite subcover.\n\nSuppose, for contradiction, that there exists a countable open cover \\( \\{ U_n \\}_{n=1}^\\infty \\) of \\( X \\) with no finite subcover. This means that for every finite \\( N \\), the union \\( U_1 \\cup U_2 \\cup \\dots \\cup U_N \\) does not cover \\( X \\), so there exists a point \\( x_{N+1} \\notin U_1 \\cup U_2 \\cup \\dots \\cup U_N \\). This process generates an infinite sequence \\( \\{ x_n \\} \\) in \\( X \\) with each \\( x_n \\) not covered by the first \\( n-1 \\) open sets.\n\nSince \\( X \\) is limit point compact, the infinite set \\( \\{ x_n \\} \\) must have a limit point \\( x \\) in \\( X \\). Being a limit point, every open neighborhood of \\( x \\) contains infinitely many points of \\( \\{ x_n \\} \\). However, because the open cover \\( \\{ U_n \\} \\) covers \\( X \\), \\( x \\) must belong to some \\( U_k \\). But \\( U_k \\) can only contain finitely many \\( x_n \\) (specifically, those with \\( n \\geq k \\)) since each \\( x_n \\) with \\( n > k \\) was chosen to not be in \\( U_k \\). This contradicts the fact that \\( x \\) is a limit point of \\( \\{ x_n \\} \\). Therefore, our assumption is wrong, and every countable open cover must indeed have a finite subcover, proving that \\( X \\) is countably compact.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIn a \\( T_1 \\) space \\( X \\), countable compactness and limit point compactness are equivalent. Countable compactness ensures that every infinite subset has a limit point, and conversely, the existence of limit points for infinite subsets guarantees that every countable open cover has a finite subcover.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: type mismatch\n  hT1\nhas type\n  T1Space X\u271d : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  T1Space \u2191X : Prop\napplication type mismatch\n  hcc X\nargument\n  X\nhas type\n  Set X\u271d : Type u_1\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u2115 \u2192 Set X\u271d : Type u_1\napplication type mismatch\n  @T1Space X\nargument\n  X\nhas type\n  \u2115 \u2192 Set X\u271d : Type u_1\nbut is expected to have type\n  Type ?u.4224 : Type (?u.4224 + 1)\napplication type mismatch\n  hlp X\nargument\n  X\nhas type\n  \u2115 \u2192 Set X\u271d : Type u_1\nbut is expected to have type\n  Set X\u271d : Type u_1\nPlease revise the proof.",

Understanding Isometries:**\nAn isometry \\( f \\) preserves distances, meaning for any two points \\( x, y \\) in \\( X \\), the distance between their images under \\( f \\) is the same as the distance between \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) themselves:\n\\[\nd(f(x), f(y)) = d(x, y)\n\\]\nThis property immediately implies that \\( f \\) is **injective** (one-to-one). If \\( f(x) = f(y) \\), then \\( d(f(x), f(y)) = 0 \\), which by the distance property means \\( d(x, y) = 0 \\), and thus \\( x = y \\). So, distinct points in \\( X \\) remain distinct under \\( f \\).\n\n**2. Leveraging Compactness for Surjectivity:**\nWhile injectivity is guaranteed by the isometry property, surjectivity (onto) isn't immediately obvious. However, the compactness of \\( X \\) plays a crucial role here. In topology, a **compact** space has the property that every continuous function from the space to itself is not only closed (the image of a closed set is closed) but also that continuous injective functions on compact spaces are automatically **closed mappings**.\n\nGiven that \\( X \\) is compact and \\( f \\) is continuous (as we'll see shortly), the image \\( f(X) \\) is also compact. In metric spaces, compact sets are closed and bounded, and since \\( f \\) is injective and maps \\( X \\) into itself, \\( f(X) \\) must be both closed and open in \\( X \\). However, in a connected space like \\( X \\), the only subsets that are both open and closed are the entire space itself. Therefore, \\( f(X) \\) must equal \\( X \\), ensuring that \\( f \\) is **surjective**.\n\n**3. Establishing Continuity:**\nAn isometry inherently preserves the structure of the space, and in metric spaces, distance preservation implies continuity. Specifically, for any sequence of points \\( \\{x_n\\} \\) in \\( X \\) that converges to some point \\( x \\), the distances \\( d(f(x_n), f(x)) \\) remain the same as \\( d(x_n, x) \\), which approaches zero. This means \\( f(x_n) \\) converges to \\( f(x) \\), satisfying the definition of continuity.\n\n**4. Concluding Homeomorphism:**\nHaving established that \\( f \\) is both bijective and continuous, and knowing that the inverse function \\( f^{-1} \\) is also an isometry (since \\( f \\) preserves distances), it follows that \\( f^{-1} \\) is continuous as well. Therefore, \\( f \\) is a **homeomorphism**, meaning it is a continuous, bijective function with a continuous inverse between the metric spaces \\( X \\) and itself.\n\nIn summary, the isometry \\( f \\) on a compact metric space \\( X \\) is injective by distance preservation, surjective due to the compactness of \\( X \\) ensuring closedness and openness of \\( f(X) \\), and continuous with a continuous inverse. These properties collectively confirm that \\( f \\) is a homeomorphism.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

Each element in this space is an infinite sequence where each coordinate lies within \\( [0, 1] \\). The uniform topology on this space is generated by the uniform metric, which measures the distance between two sequences based on the maximum difference across all coordinates. Specifically, the distance \\( d \\) between two sequences \\( x = (x_1, x_2, x_3, \\ldots) \\) and \\( y = (y_1, y_2, y_3, \\ldots) \\) is defined as:\n\\[ d(x, y) = \\sup_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} |x_n - y_n| \\]\nThis metric ensures that convergence in this topology requires sequences to become uniformly close across all coordinates.\n\nNow, let's explore the concept of local compactness. A space is locally compact if every point has a neighborhood that is compact. In finite-dimensional spaces, like \\( [0, 1]^n \\), compactness and local compactness coincide nicely due to properties like the Heine-Borel theorem. However, the scenario changes dramatically in infinite-dimensional spaces.\n\nIn the infinite-dimensional setting of \\( [0, 1]^\\omega \\), equipped with the uniform topology, the space lacks local compactness. Here's why:\n\n1. **Infinite Dimensionality and Compactness:** In finite-dimensional spaces, bounded and closed sets are compact. However, as we move to infinite dimensions, this equivalence breaks down. Specifically, in \\( [0, 1]^\\omega \\), even though the entire space is bounded, it is not compact under the uniform topology. This is because infinite-dimensional spaces can have sequences that do not contain any convergent subsequences\u2014a property essential for compactness.\n\n2. **Neighborhoods in \\( [0, 1]^\\omega \\):** Consider any open neighborhood around a point in \\( [0, 1]^\\omega \\). Due to the uniform metric, this neighborhood must contain sequences that are uniformly close to the central point across all coordinates. However, because there are infinitely many coordinates, it's possible to construct sequences within this neighborhood that differ in infinitely many places, preventing the existence of a convergent subsequence within the neighborhood.\n\n3. **Lack of Compact Neighborhoods:** Since we can always find sequences within any neighborhood that do not have convergent subsequences, no neighborhood can be compact. Without compact neighborhoods around points, the space \\( [0, 1]^\\omega \\) fails to satisfy the definition of local compactness.\n\n4. **Comparison with Known Results:** This aligns with known results in topology and functional analysis, where infinite-dimensional normed spaces (like \\( l^\\infty \\), which is closely related to \\( [0, 1]^\\omega \\) under the uniform norm) are not locally compact. The intuition is that infinite dimensions introduce too much \"room\" for sequences to diverge, preventing the tight clustering required for compactness.\n\nIn summary, the infinite-dimensional nature of \\( [0, 1]^\\omega \\) under the uniform topology leads to the impossibility of having compact neighborhoods around its points. Consequently, \\( [0, 1]^\\omega \\) is not locally compact in the uniform topology.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'Compactness.noncompact_space'\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'Compactness.noncompact_space'\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'Compactness.noncompact_space'\nPlease revise the proof.",

Understanding the Building Blocks:**\n   \n   - **Countable Spaces with Dense Subsets:** Suppose we have a collection of spaces \\( \\{S_\\alpha\\}_{\\alpha \\in I} \\), where \\( I \\) is a countable index set. Each space \\( S_\\alpha \\) is separable, meaning it contains a countable dense subset. Let's denote these dense subsets by \\( D_\\alpha \\) for each \\( \\alpha \\in I \\).\n\n**2. Constructing a Dense Subset for the Product Space:**\n   \n   - **Forming the Product of Dense Subsets:** Consider the product space \\( S = \\prod_{\\alpha \\in I} S_\\alpha \\). To build a dense subset for \\( S \\), take the product of all the dense subsets \\( D_\\alpha \\), denoted by \\( D = \\prod_{\\alpha \\in I} D_\\alpha \\).\n   \n   - **Countability of the Product Set:** Since each \\( D_\\alpha \\) is countable and the index set \\( I \\) is countable, the product \\( D \\) is also countable. This follows from the principle that a countable product of countable sets remains countable.\n\n**3. Establishing Density in the Product Topology:**\n   \n   - **Understanding the Basis for the Product Topology:** The product space \\( S \\) is equipped with the product topology, whose basis consists of \"basic open sets.\" A basic open set is formed by taking the product of open sets \\( U_\\alpha \\) from each \\( S_\\alpha \\), where all but finitely many of these \\( U_\\alpha \\) are the entire space \\( S_\\alpha \\).

Take any basic open set \\( U = \\prod_{\\alpha \\in I} U_\\alpha \\). Since each \\( D_\\alpha \\) is dense in \\( S_\\alpha \\), the intersection \\( U_\\alpha \\cap D_\\alpha \\) is non-empty for each \\( \\alpha \\).\n   \n   - **Constructing a Point in the Intersection:** For each \\( \\alpha \\), choose an element \\( x_\\alpha \\) from \\( U_\\alpha \\cap D_\\alpha \\).

By definition, a regular space is one where, given any point and a closed set not containing that point, there exist disjoint open neighborhoods separating them. Additionally, in regular spaces, single points are closed because regularity implies the \\( T_1 \\) separation axiom.\n\nNow, take any two distinct points \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) in \\( X \\). Since \\( X \\) is \\( T_1 \\), the singleton sets \\( \\{x\\} \\) and \\( \\{y\\} \\) are closed.\n\nFirst, apply the regularity of \\( X \\) to the point \\( x \\) and the closed set \\( \\{y\\} \\). According to the definition, there exist open neighborhoods \\( U_x \\) of \\( x \\) and \\( V_y \\) of \\( \\{y\\} \\) such that \\( U_x \\) and \\( V_y \\) are disjoint; that is, \\( U_x \\cap V_y = \\emptyset \\).\n\nSimilarly, apply regularity to the point \\( y \\) and the closed set \\( \\{x\\} \\). This gives us open neighborhoods \\( U_y \\) of \\( y \\) and \\( V_x \\) of \\( \\{x\\} \\) that are also disjoint: \\( U_y \\cap V_x = \\emptyset \\).\n\nAt this stage, we have:\n- \\( U_x \\) is an open neighborhood of \\( x \\) disjoint from \\( V_y \\), which contains \\( y \\).\n- \\( U_y \\) is an open neighborhood of \\( y \\) disjoint from \\( V_x \\), which contains \\( x \\).\n\nNow, consider the closures of these neighborhoods. Let\u2019s denote the closure of \\( U_x \\) by \\( \\overline{U_x} \\) and the closure of \\( U_y \\) by \\( \\overline{U_y} \\).\n\nSuppose, for contradiction, that \\( \\overline{U_x} \\) and \\( \\overline{U_y} \\) are not disjoint. Then there exists a point \\( z \\) that lies in both \\( \\overline{U_x} \\) and \\( \\overline{U_y} \\). \n\nSince \\( z \\) is in \\( \\overline{U_x} \\), every open neighborhood of \\( z \\) intersects \\( U_x \\). Similarly, as \\( z \\) is in \\( \\overline{U_y} \\), every open neighborhood of \\( z \\) intersects \\( U_y \\). However, \\( U_x \\) and \\( U_y \\) are both open neighborhoods of distinct points and were chosen to be disjoint from each other's corresponding closed sets. This leads to a contradiction because \\( z \\) cannot simultaneously belong to both \\( U_x \\) and \\( U_y \\) given their disjointness.\n\nTherefore, our assumption is false, and \\( \\overline{U_x} \\) and \\( \\overline{U_y} \\) must indeed be disjoint.\n\nIn summary, for any two distinct points \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) in a regular space \\( X \\), we can find open neighborhoods \\( U_x \\) of \\( x \\) and \\( U_y \\) of \\( y \\) such that their closures \\( \\overline{U_x} \\) and \\( \\overline{U_y} \\) do not overlap.

        "informal_proof": "# Informal Proof:\n\nTo show that every order topology is regular, let's first recall what it means for a topological space to be **regular**. A space is regular if, whenever we have a closed set \\( C \\) and a point \\( x \\) not in \\( C \\), there exist disjoint open sets containing \\( x \\) and \\( C \\), respectively. \n\nNow, consider a set \\( X \\) equipped with an **order topology**. This means that the open sets in \\( X \\) are generated by the order relations of \\( X \\). Specifically, the basic open sets are intervals of the form \\( (a, b) \\), where \\( a < b \\) in \\( X \\).\n\nLet's take any closed set \\( C \\) in \\( X \\) and a point \\( x \\) not in \\( C \\). Since \\( C \\) is closed, its complement \\( X \\setminus C \\) is open. Because \\( x \\) is in \\( X \\setminus C \\), and the topology is generated by open intervals, there exists an open interval around \\( x \\) that lies entirely within \\( X \\setminus C \\). Let's denote this open interval as \\( (c, d) \\), where \\( c < x < d \\).\n\nOur goal is to find two disjoint open sets: one containing \\( x \\) and the other containing \\( C \\). \n\n1. **Constructing the Open Set Around \\( x \\):**  \n   The open interval \\( (c, d) \\) already serves as an open neighborhood around \\( x \\) that doesn't intersect \\( C \\), since \\( (c, d) \\subseteq X \\setminus C \\).\n\n2. **Constructing the Open Set Around \\( C \\):**  \n   Since \\( X \\) has an order topology, and \\( C \\) is closed, for every point \\( y \\) in \\( C \\), we can find open intervals around \\( y \\) that do not contain \\( x \\). More formally, for each \\( y \\in C \\), there exist \\( a_y \\) and \\( b_y \\) such that \\( a_y < y < b_y \\) and the interval \\( (a_y, b_y) \\) does not contain \\( x \\).\n\n   The collection of all such intervals \\( (a_y, b_y) \\) for each \\( y \\in C \\) forms an open cover for \\( C \\). Since \\( C \\) is closed and, in many cases, compact (depending on \\( X \\)), we can extract a finite subcover from this collection. Let's denote the finite union of these intervals as \\( U \\), which is an open set containing \\( C \\).\n\n3. **Ensuring Disjointness:**  \n   By construction, the open set \\( (c, d) \\) containing \\( x \\) does not intersect any of the intervals \\( (a_y, b_y) \\) covering \\( C \\). Therefore, \\( (c, d) \\) and \\( U \\) are disjoint open sets, with \\( x \\in (c, d) \\) and \\( C \\subseteq U \\).\n\nSince we've successfully found two disjoint open sets separating the point \\( x \\) and the closed set \\( C \\), this demonstrates that the space \\( X \\) with an order topology satisfies the regularity condition. Therefore, every order topology is indeed a regular topological space.\nPrevious attempt failed with: invalid field 'toTopologicalSpace', the environment does not contain 'OrderTopology.toTopologicalSpace'\n  h\nhas type\n  OrderTopology \u03b1\ninvalid field 'toOrderTopology', the environment does not contain 'OrderTopology.toOrderTopology'\n  h\nhas type\n  OrderTopology \u03b1\nfailed to synthesize\n  RegularSpace \u03b1\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: function expected at\n  OrderTopology\nterm has type\n  ?m.12\nfunction expected at\n  RegularSpace\nterm has type\n  ?m.28\nno goals to be solved\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown namespace 'TopologicalSpace'\nunexpected token '*'; expected '}'\nPlease revise the proof.",

Recall that a space being Hausdorff means that any two distinct points can be separated by disjoint open neighborhoods.\n\n**Objective:** We need to demonstrate that for any specific index \\( \\alpha \\), the corresponding space \\( X_\\alpha \\) also has this Hausdorff property.\n\n**Choosing Points in \\( X_\\alpha \\):** Take any two distinct points \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) in \\( X_\\alpha \\). Our goal is to find open sets in \\( X_\\alpha \\) that contain \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) respectively and do not overlap.\n\n**Embedding into the Product Space:** Since each \\( X_\\alpha \\) is nonempty, we can construct points in the product space \\( \\prod X_\\alpha \\) that align with \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) in the \\( \\alpha \\)-th coordinate and agree on all other coordinates. Specifically:\n- Let \\( z \\) be a point in the product space where, for every index \\( \\beta \\) not equal to \\( \\alpha \\), the \\( \\beta \\)-th coordinate is fixed (chosen arbitrarily).\n- Define two points in the product space:\n  - \\( x' \\) coincides with \\( z \\) in all coordinates except the \\( \\alpha \\)-th, where it takes the value \\( x \\).\n  - \\( y' \\) coincides with \\( z \\) in all coordinates except the \\( \\alpha \\)-th, where it takes the value \\( y \\).\n\n**Applying the Hausdorff Property in the Product Space:** Since \\( \\prod X_\\alpha \\) is Hausdorff, the points \\( x' \\) and \\( y' \\) can be separated by disjoint open neighborhoods. Let\u2019s call these neighborhoods \\( U \\) and \\( V \\), where \\( x' \\) is in \\( U \\) and \\( y' \\) is in \\( V \\), with \\( U \\) and \\( V \\) not overlapping.\n\n**Refining to Basic Open Sets:** The topology on the product space is defined by the product topology, which has a natural basis consisting of \"boxes\" where only finitely many coordinates vary. Therefore, we can find smaller open sets \\( U' \\) and \\( V' \\) within \\( U \\) and \\( V \\) respectively that are basic open sets containing \\( x' \\) and \\( y' \\) and still remain disjoint.\n\n**Analyzing the Basis Elements:** These basic open sets \\( U' \\) and \\( V' \\) can be expressed as products of open sets in each coordinate:\n- \\( U' = \\prod U_\\beta \\), where each \\( U_\\beta \\) is open in \\( X_\\beta \\), and \\( U_\\beta \\) equals the entire space \\( X_\\beta \\) for all but finitely many \\( \\beta \\).\n- Similarly, \\( V' = \\prod V_\\beta \\).\n\n**Intersection of Bases:** The intersection \\( U' \\cap V' \\) corresponds to the product of the intersections \\( U_\\beta \\cap V_\\beta \\) across all indices \\( \\beta \\). Since \\( U' \\) and \\( V' \\) are disjoint, this intersection must be empty. Therefore, there must be at least one coordinate where \\( U_\\beta \\) and \\( V_\\beta \\) do not overlap.\n\n**Focusing on the \\( \\alpha \\)-th Coordinate:** For all indices \\( \\beta \\) other than \\( \\alpha \\), the fixed coordinate \\( z_\\beta \\) lies in both \\( U_\\beta \\) and \\( V_\\beta \\), meaning their intersection is not empty there. Therefore, the only coordinate where \\( U_\\beta \\) and \\( V_\\beta \\) can be disjoint is \\( \\beta = \\alpha \\). This implies that \\( U_\\alpha \\) and \\( V_\\alpha \\) are disjoint open sets in \\( X_\\alpha \\).\n\n**Final Separation in \\( X_\\alpha \\):** Specifically, \\( x \\) lies in \\( U_\\alpha \\) and \\( y \\) lies in \\( V_\\alpha \\). Since \\( U_\\alpha \\) and \\( V_\\alpha \\) are open, contain \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) respectively, and do not overlap, we've successfully separated \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) by disjoint open neighborhoods in \\( X_\\alpha \\).\n\n**Conclusion:** Since any two distinct points in \\( X_\\alpha \\) can be separated by such open sets, \\( X_\\alpha \\) satisfies the Hausdorff condition. As the choice of \\( \\alpha \\) was arbitrary, this holds for every factor space in the family.

This means that around each point, we can find compact neighborhoods that \"capture\" the local behavior of the space.\n\n- **Hausdorff**: A space is Hausdorff if any two distinct points can be separated by disjoint open neighborhoods. This property ensures a good level of separation between points, which is crucial for many topological arguments.\n\n- **Completely Regular**: A space is completely regular if, given any closed set \\( F \\) and a point \\( x \\) not in \\( F \\), there exists a continuous real-valued function that maps \\( x \\) to 0 and maps all points in \\( F \\) to 1. Essentially, this property allows us to \"separate\" a point and a closed set using continuous functions.\n\nNow, let's proceed with the proof:\n\n1. **Starting Point**: Take any locally compact Hausdorff space \\( X \\). We need to prove that \\( X \\) is completely regular. That is, for any closed set \\( F \\subseteq X \\) and any point \\( x \\notin F \\), there exists a continuous function \\( f: X \\to [0, 1] \\) such that \\( f(x) = 0 \\) and \\( f(y) = 1 \\) for all \\( y \\in F \\).\n\n2. **Locally Compact Neighborhood**: Since \\( X \\) is locally compact, the point \\( x \\) has a compact neighborhood. Let's denote this neighborhood by \\( K \\). Because \\( X \\) is Hausdorff, compact subsets are closed, so \\( K \\) is also a closed set containing \\( x \\).\n\n3. **Separation of Points and Closed Sets**: The point \\( x \\) is not in the closed set \\( F \\), and \\( K \\) is a compact neighborhood of \\( x \\). Since \\( X \\) is Hausdorff, \\( K \\) and \\( F \\) are both closed sets that do not intersect each other. By the properties of Hausdorff spaces, there exist disjoint open sets \\( U \\) and \\( V \\) such that \\( x \\in U \\) and \\( F \\subseteq V \\).\n\n4. **Constructing the Function**:\n   - Define a function \\( f \\) that will map points in \\( U \\) to values close to 0 and points in \\( V \\) to values close to 1. Specifically, we can use a partition of unity subordinate to the open covers \\( \\{U, X \\setminus V\\} \\).\n   - Since \\( K \\) is compact and contained in \\( U \\), we can extend the function smoothly from \\( K \\) to the whole space \\( X \\) while ensuring that it remains continuous. The local compactness ensures that these extensions can be made without breaking continuity.\n\n5. **Ensuring Continuity and Desired Values**:\n   - The construction ensures that \\( f(x) = 0 \\) because \\( x \\) is in \\( U \\).\n   - For every \\( y \\in F \\), since \\( F \\subseteq V \\), \\( f(y) = 1 \\).\n   - The continuity of \\( f \\) is guaranteed by the way we extended the function using the compact neighborhoods and the Hausdorff separation.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: We have successfully constructed a continuous function \\( f: X \\to [0, 1] \\) that separates the point \\( x \\) from the closed set \\( F \\) as required. Therefore, \\( X \\) is completely regular.\n\nThis argument leverages the local compactness to find suitable compact neighborhoods and uses the Hausdorff property to ensure that these neighborhoods can be separated from closed sets via continuous functions.

Since \\( X_1 \\) and \\( X_2 \\) cover \\( X \\), their bases \\( \\mathcal{B}_1 \\) and \\( \\mathcal{B}_2 \\) effectively cover all open sets in \\( X \\).\n   - Therefore, \\( \\mathcal{B} \\) serves as a countable base for the entire space \\( X \\).\n\n4. **Applying Metrization Theorems:**\n   - One of the key metrization theorems in topology is **Urysohn's Metrization Theorem**, which states that a space is metrizable if it is regular (which is true for normal spaces) and has a countable base.\n   - Since \\( X \\) is compact Hausdorff (hence normal) and now we've established that it has a countable base, Urysohn's theorem applies directly.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - By satisfying the conditions of Urysohn's Metrization Theorem\u2014being a normal space with a countable base\u2014\\( X \\) must be metrizable.\n   \nThus, we have shown that \\( X \\), being a compact Hausdorff space formed by the union of two closed metrizable subspaces \\( X_1 \\) and \\( X_2 \\), is itself metrizable.\nPrevious attempt failed with: invalid field 'toPseudoMetricSpace', the environment does not contain 'TopologicalSpace.MetrizableSpace.toPseudoMetricSpace'\n  hX1m\nhas type\n  MetrizableSpace \u2191X1\ninvalid field 'toPseudoMetricSpace', the environment does not contain 'TopologicalSpace.MetrizableSpace.toPseudoMetricSpace'\n  hX2m\nhas type\n  MetrizableSpace \u2191X2\nunknown identifier 'metrizableSpace_of_closed_univ'\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: function expected at\n  MetrizableSpace\nterm has type\n  ?m.145\nfunction expected at\n  MetrizableSpace\nterm has type\n  ?m.145\nfunction expected at\n  MetrizableSpace\nterm has type\n  ?m.145\nfunction expected at\n  MetrizableSpace\nterm has type\n  x\u271d\nfunction expected at\n  MetrizableSpace\nterm has type\n  x\u271d\nunknown identifier 'metrizableSpace_of_closed_univ'\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: function expected at\n  MetrizableSpace\nterm has type\n  ?m.145\nfunction expected at\n  MetrizableSpace\nterm has type\n  ?m.145\nfunction expected at\n  MetrizableSpace\nterm has type\n  ?m.145\nfunction expected at\n  MetrizableSpace\nterm has type\n  x\u271d\nfunction expected at\n  MetrizableSpace\nterm has type\n  x\u271d\nfailed to synthesize\n  RegularSpace X\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nunknown identifier 'metrizableSpace_of_closed_univ'\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "# Informal Proof:\n\nLet's begin by understanding the setting of the problem. We have two metric spaces: \\( X \\) with distance \\( d_X \\) and \\( Y \\) with distance \\( d_Y \\). Importantly, \\( Y \\) is a complete metric space, meaning that every Cauchy sequence in \\( Y \\) converges to a point within \\( Y \\). We are given a subset \\( A \\) of \\( X \\) and a function \\( f: A \\to Y \\) that is uniformly continuous. Our goal is to extend \\( f \\) to a function \\( g \\) defined on the closure of \\( A \\) (denoted \\( \\bar{A} \\)) such that \\( g \\) is continuous, agrees with \\( f \\) on \\( A \\), is unique, and remains uniformly continuous.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding Uniform Continuity and Closures**\n\nUniform continuity of \\( f \\) means that for any small distance \\( \\epsilon > 0 \\) in \\( Y \\), there exists a corresponding distance \\( \\delta > 0 \\) in \\( X \\) such that whenever two points in \\( A \\) are within \\( \\delta \\) of each other, their images under \\( f \\) are within \\( \\epsilon \\) of each other in \\( Y \\). This property doesn't depend on where the points are in \\( A \\); it's uniform across the entire domain.\n\nThe closure \\( \\bar{A} \\) of \\( A \\) includes all the limit points of \\( A \\). That is, any point in \\( \\bar{A} \\) can be approached arbitrarily closely by points from \\( A \\).\n\n**Step 2: Constructing the Extension \\( g \\)**\n\nTo define \\( g \\) on \\( \\bar{A} \\), take any point \\( a \\) in \\( \\bar{A} \\). By definition of closure, there exists a sequence \\( \\{a_n\\} \\) in \\( A \\) that converges to \\( a \\). Since \\( f \\) is uniformly continuous, the images \\( \\{f(a_n)\\} \\) form a Cauchy sequence in \\( Y \\). Here's why:\n\nGiven any \\( \\epsilon > 0 \\), uniform continuity provides a \\( \\delta > 0 \\) such that if \\( d_X(a_n, a_m) < \\delta \\), then \\( d_Y(f(a_n), f(a_m)) < \\epsilon \\). Because \\( a_n \\to a \\), the distances \\( d_X(a_n, a_m) \\) become uniformly small as \\( n, m \\) increase, ensuring that \\( \\{f(a_n)\\} \\) is Cauchy.\n\nSince \\( Y \\) is complete, this Cauchy sequence \\( \\{f(a_n)\\} \\) converges to some limit in \\( Y \\). We define \\( g(a) \\) to be this limit. This process effectively \"fills in\" the value of \\( f \\) at the boundary points of \\( A \\) by taking limits of values from within \\( A \\).\n\n**Step 3: Ensuring \\( g \\) is Well-Defined and Continuous**\n\nTo confirm that \\( g \\) is well-defined, we must show that the limit \\( \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} f(a_n) \\) is the same regardless of the sequence \\( \\{a_n\\} \\) chosen to approach \\( a \\). Suppose we have two sequences \\( \\{a_n\\} \\) and \\( \\{b_n\\} \\) in \\( A \\) both converging to \\( a \\). The uniform continuity of \\( f \\) ensures that the sequences \\( \\{f(a_n)\\} \\) and \\( \\{f(b_n)\\} \\) are both Cauchy and their difference becomes arbitrarily small, meaning they converge to the same limit. This guarantees uniqueness of \\( g(a) \\).\n\nNext, to establish continuity of \\( g \\), take any point \\( a \\) in \\( \\bar{A} \\) and a sequence \\( \\{a_n\\} \\) in \\( \\bar{A} \\) converging to \\( a \\). By the way we've defined \\( g \\), the images \\( g(a_n) \\) will correspond to the limits of sequences from \\( A \\) approaching \\( a_n \\), and ultimately, these will converge to \\( g(a) \\). This aligns with the definition of continuity in metric spaces, ensuring that \\( g \\) is continuous on \\( \\bar{A} \\).\n\n**Step 4: Proving Uniqueness**\n\nSuppose there exists another continuous function \\( h: \\bar{A} \\to Y \\) that also extends \\( f \\) (i.e., \\( h(a) = f(a) \\) for all \\( a \\in A \\)). For any \\( a \\in \\bar{A} \\), take a sequence \\( \\{a_n\\} \\) in \\( A \\) converging to \\( a \\). Both \\( g(a) \\) and \\( h(a) \\) must be the limits of \\( f(a_n) \\), given the continuity of \\( h \\). Therefore, \\( g(a) = h(a) \\) for all \\( a \\in \\bar{A} \\), establishing that \\( g \\) is the unique continuous extension of \\( f \\).\n\n**Step 5: Maintaining Uniform Continuity**\n\nFinally, we need to show that \\( g \\) is uniformly continuous on \\( \\bar{A} \\). Since \\( g \\) agrees with \\( f \\) on \\( A \\) and \\( f \\) is uniformly continuous, any two points in \\( \\bar{A} \\) can be approached by sequences from \\( A \\) where the uniform continuity condition applies. The limits of these sequences preserve the uniform continuity condition, ensuring that for any \\( \\epsilon > 0 \\), the same \\( \\delta \\) works for points in \\( \\bar{A} \\) as it did for points in \\( A \\). Hence, \\( g \\) inherits the uniform continuity from \\( f \\).\n\nIn summary, by leveraging the completeness of \\( Y \\) and the uniform continuity of \\( f \\), we can uniquely extend \\( f \\) to a continuous and uniformly continuous function \\( g \\) on the closure of \\( A \\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'let'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'let'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'let'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

When we add these fractions together, we'll get a single fraction that we can express in its simplest form as \\( \\frac{A}{B} \\), where \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are integers with no common factors (i.e., the fraction is reduced to lowest terms).\n\n**Step 2: Introducing a Special Prime**\nBy Bertrand's Postulate, which states that for every integer \\( n \\geq 2 \\), there exists at least one prime number \\( p \\) such that \\( \\frac{n}{2} < p \\leq n \\). Let's select such a prime \\( p \\) within our range.\n\n**Step 3: Analyzing the Prime's Contribution**\nThe prime \\( p \\) appears in the denominator of the term \\( \\frac{1}{p} \\) in the sum \\( S_n \\). Since \\( p \\) is a prime greater than \\( \\frac{n}{2} \\), it doesn't divide any of the other denominators in the sum \\( S_n \\). This uniqueness means that when we add up all the fractions, the prime \\( p \\) remains in the denominator of the final sum's simplified form.\n\n**Step 4: Implications for the Sum Being an Integer**\nFor \\( S_n \\) to be an integer, the denominator \\( B \\) in its reduced form \\( \\frac{A}{B} \\) must be 1. However, we've established that \\( p \\) is a factor of \\( B \\) because of the term \\( \\frac{1}{p} \\) and the fact that no other term in the sum can cancel out this prime in the denominator. Since \\( p > 1 \\), \\( B \\) cannot be 1, which means \\( S_n \\) cannot be an integer.\n\n**Conclusion**\nTherefore, for any integer \\( n \\geq 2 \\), the sum \\( S_n = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{n} \\) cannot be an integer because it necessarily has a prime factor in the denominator that prevents the sum from being a whole number.\nPrevious attempt failed with: linarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase intro\nn : \u2115\na : \u2124\nh : \u2211 i : Fin n, 1 / (\u2191n + 2) = \u2191a\nthis : \u2191n * (\u2191n + 2)\u207b\u00b9 = \u2191a\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nunsolved goals\ncase intro\nn : \u2115\na : \u2124\nh : \u2211 i : Fin n, 1 / (\u2191n + 2) = \u2191a\nthis : \u2191n * (\u2191n + 2)\u207b\u00b9 = \u2191a\n\u22a2 False\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: linarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase intro\nn : \u2115\na : \u2124\nh this\u271d\u2074 this\u271d\u00b3 this\u271d\u00b2 this\u271d\u00b9 this\u271d this : \u2211 i : Fin n, 1 / (\u2191n + 2) = \u2191a\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: linarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase intro\nn : \u2115\na : \u2124\nh this\u271d\u2074 this\u271d\u00b3 this\u271d\u00b2 this\u271d\u00b9 this\u271d this : \u2211 i : Fin n, 1 / (\u2191n + 2) = \u2191a\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nPlease revise the proof.",

Our goal is to show that this gcd is either 1 or 2, depending on whether \\( a \\) is even or odd.\n\n**Case 1: \\( a \\) is even**\n\nWhen \\( a \\) is even, it can be expressed as \\( a = 2k \\) for some integer \\( k \\). Raising \\( a \\) to any power preserves its evenness, so both \\( a^{2^{n}} \\) and \\( a^{2^{m}} \\) are even numbers. Adding 1 to an even number results in an odd number. Therefore, both \\( a^{2^{n}} + 1 \\) and \\( a^{2^{m}} + 1 \\) are odd.\n\nSince both numbers are odd, their gcd cannot be even; the only possible common divisor is 1. There are no larger common factors because any potential common divisor greater than 1 would have to divide two distinct odd numbers that differ by an even number \\( a^{2^{n}} - a^{2^{m}} \\), which doesn\u2019t introduce any new common factors beyond 1.\n\n**Case 2: \\( a \\) is odd**\n\nWhen \\( a \\) is odd, it can be written as \\( a = 2k + 1 \\) for some integer \\( k \\). Raising an odd number to any power keeps it odd, so both \\( a^{2^{n}} \\) and \\( a^{2^{m}} \\) are odd. Adding 1 to an odd number yields an even number. Therefore, both \\( a^{2^{n}} + 1 \\) and \\( a^{2^{m}} + 1 \\) are even.\n\nSince both numbers are even, they are both divisible by 2. However, to determine if there's a larger common divisor, suppose there exists a prime \\( p > 2 \\) that divides both \\( a^{2^{n}} + 1 \\) and \\( a^{2^{m}} + 1 \\). Then \\( p \\) would have to divide the difference of these two numbers:\n\n\\[\np \\mid (a^{2^{n}} + 1) - (a^{2^{m}} + 1) = a^{2^{n}} - a^{2^{m}}\n\\]\n\nFactorizing, we get:\n\n\\[\na^{2^{m}} (a^{2^{n - m}} - 1)\n\\]\n\nSince \\( a \\) is odd, \\( a^{2^{m}} \\) is also odd, and thus \\( p \\) cannot divide \\( a^{2^{m}} \\). Therefore, \\( p \\) must divide \\( a^{2^{n - m}} - 1 \\). However, because \\( a^{2^{n}} \\equiv -1 \\mod p \\) and \\( a^{2^{m}} \\equiv -1 \\mod p \\), it would imply that \\( a^{2^{n - m}} \\equiv 1 \\mod p \\). Combining these, we arrive at a contradiction unless \\( p = 2 \\).\n\nThus, the only common divisor for both numbers when \\( a \\) is odd is 2.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- If \\( a \\) is **even**, then \\( a^{2^{n}} + 1 \\) and \\( a^{2^{m}} + 1 \\) are both odd, and their gcd is **1**.\n- If \\( a \\) is **odd**, then both numbers are even, and their gcd is **2**.\n\nTherefore, the greatest common divisor \\( \\left(a^{2^{n}} + 1, \\, a^{2^{m}} + 1\\right) \\) is 1 or 2 depending on whether \\( a \\) is even or odd, respectively.",

A square-free integer is one that is not divisible by any perfect square other than 1. Examples include 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, etc. Importantly, the density of square-free numbers among all positive integers is relatively high. In fact, the probability that a randomly chosen integer is square-free is \\( \\frac{6}{\\pi^2} \\), which is approximately 0.6079. This means that a significant portion of the integers are square-free.\n\nWhen we sum the reciprocals of just the square-free integers, we're essentially taking a large subset of the harmonic series. Since the density of square-free numbers is a positive constant, the subset retains enough of the original harmonic series' \"size\" to ensure that the sum still grows without bound.\n\nMore formally, because the number of square-free integers up to some large number \\( N \\) is roughly proportional to \\( N \\) (specifically, about \\( \\frac{6N}{\\pi^2} \\)), the partial sums of their reciprocals behave similarly to those of the harmonic series.

Remember that \\( (n-1)! \\) is the product of all positive integers from 1 up to \\( n-1 \\). Therefore, both \\( r \\) and \\( s \\) are included in this product.\n\nBecause \\( r \\) and \\( s \\) are both factors of \\( n \\) and are present in \\( (n-1)! \\), their product \\( r \\times s = n \\) must also divide \\( (n-1)! \\). This means that \\( n \\) divides \\( (n-1)! \\) in this case.\n\n**2. Composite Numbers as Squares of Primes:**\n\nThe second case arises when the composite number \\( n \\) is the square of a prime number, i.e., \\( n = p^2 \\), where \\( p \\) is a prime greater than 2 (since we've excluded \\( n = 4 \\), which is \\( 2^2 \\)). \n\nIn this scenario, \\( p \\) is a prime number, and since \\( n = p^2 \\), we need to ensure that \\( (n-1)! \\) contains enough factors of \\( p \\) to account for \\( p^2 \\). Notice that \\( (n-1)! \\) includes all integers from 1 to \\( p^2 - 1 \\). Since \\( p > 2 \\), it follows that \\( 2p < p^2 \\) (for example, if \\( p = 3 \\), then \\( 2p = 6 < 9 = p^2 \\)).\n\nThis means that not only does \\( p \\) appear in the factorial \\( (n-1)! \\), but so does \\( 2p \\), which is another multiple of \\( p \\). Therefore, \\( (n-1)! \\) contains at least two factors of \\( p \\), ensuring that \\( p^2 \\) divides \\( (n-1)! \\). Consequently, \\( n = p^2 \\) divides \\( (n-1)! \\) when \\( p > 2 \\).\n\n**Exceptional Case \u2013 \\( n = 4 \\):**\n\nIt's important to address the special case where \\( n = 4 \\). Here, \\( 4 = 2^2 \\), but \\( (4-1)! = 3! = 6 \\). While 6 is divisible by 2, it is not divisible by \\( 2^2 = 4 \\). This is why \\( n = 4 \\) is excluded from the general assertion that composite numbers divide their corresponding factorials \\( (n-1)! \\).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy examining both scenarios\u2014composite numbers with distinct factors and those that are squares of primes greater than 2\u2014we see that for all composite numbers \\( n \\) (except \\( n = 4 \\)), the factorial \\( (n-1)! \\) is indeed divisible by \\( n \\). This comprehensive approach ensures that the theorem holds true across all relevant cases.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ':'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown constant 'Nat.sub_ne_zero_of_ne'\napplication type mismatch\n  lt_of_succ_lt ha\nargument\n  ha\nhas type\n  a > 1 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  a.succ.succ < a * b - 1 : Prop\nunknown constant 'Nat.sub_ne_zero_of_ne'\napplication type mismatch\n  lt_of_succ_lt hb\nargument\n  hb\nhas type\n  b > 1 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  b.succ.succ < a * b - 1 : Prop\nunknown constant 'Nat.modEq_zero_of_dvd'\nunknown constant 'Nat.sub_ne_zero_of_ne'\napplication type mismatch\n  lt_of_succ_lt (Prime.pos hp)\nargument\n  Prime.pos hp\nhas type\n  0 < p : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  p.succ.succ < p ^ 2 - 1 : Prop\nunknown constant 'Nat.sub_ne_zero_of_ne'\napplication type mismatch\n  lt_of_succ_lt (Nat.mul_pos (Prime.pos hp) (Prime.pos hp))\nargument\n  Nat.mul_pos (Prime.pos hp) (Prime.pos hp)\nhas type\n  p * p > 0 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  (2 * p).succ.succ < p ^ 2 - 1 : Prop\nunknown constant 'Nat.modEq_zero_of_dvd'\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'n'\nunknown identifier 'n'\nunknown constant 'Nat.modEq_zero_of_dvd'\nambiguous, possible interpretations \n  _root_.Prime p : Prop\n  \n  p.Prime : Prop\nunknown identifier 'n'\nunknown identifier 'n'\nunknown constant 'Nat.modEq_zero_of_dvd'\nPlease revise the proof.",

In other words, the smallest positive integer \\( k \\) for which \\( g^k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p} \\) is \\( k = p - 1 \\). This means \\( g \\) has order \\( p - 1 \\) in the multiplicative group of integers modulo \\( p \\).\n\n2. **Analyzing \\( -1 \\) as a Quadratic Residue:**\n   Since \\( p = 4t + 1 \\) is an odd prime, it satisfies \\( p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4} \\). Euler's Criterion tells us that \\( -1 \\) is a quadratic residue modulo \\( p \\) if and only if \\( p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4} \\). Therefore, \\( -1 \\) is a square modulo \\( p \\), meaning there exists some integer \\( x \\) such that \\( x^2 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p} \\).\n\n3. **Relating \\( a \\) and \\( -a \\):**\n   Suppose \\( a \\) is a primitive root modulo \\( p \\). We want to show that \\( -a \\) is also a primitive root. Consider the order of \\( -a \\) modulo \\( p \\). Since \\( -1 \\) is a quadratic residue, multiplying \\( a \\) by \\( -1 \\) (which is a square) does not change the order of \\( a \\). Specifically, if \\( a^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p} \\), then:\n   \\[\n   (-a)^{p-1} = (-1)^{p-1} \\cdot a^{p-1} \\equiv (-1)^{p-1} \\cdot 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}\n   \\]\n   Because \\( p - 1 \\) is even (since \\( p = 4t + 1 \\)), \\( (-1)^{p-1} = 1 \\). Thus, \\( (-a)^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p} \\), and no smaller positive integer \\( k \\) will satisfy \\( (-a)^k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p} \\), mirroring the behavior of \\( a \\).\n\n4. **Conversely, If \\( -a \\) is a Primitive Root:**\n   The argument works in reverse as well. If \\( -a \\) is a primitive root, then multiplying by \\( -1 \\) (a quadratic residue) again preserves the order, ensuring that \\( a \\) must also be a primitive root.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   Therefore, when \\( p \\) is a prime of the form \\( 4t + 1 \\), multiplying a primitive root \\( a \\) by \\( -1 \\) yields another primitive root \\( -a \\), and vice versa. This establishes the bidirectional implication that \\( a \\) is a primitive root modulo \\( p \\) if and only if \\( -a \\) is a primitive root modulo \\( p \\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

In other words, we want to demonstrate that \\( 3 \\) generates the entire multiplicative group of integers modulo \\( p \\), denoted \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p^* \\).\n\n**Understanding the Structure of \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p^* \\):**\nSince \\( p \\) is a prime, the multiplicative group \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p^* \\) consists of all integers from \\( 1 \\) to \\( p-1 \\) that are relatively prime to \\( p \\). The order of this group is \\( p-1 = 2^n \\), which is a power of two. A primitive root modulo \\( p \\) is an element whose powers generate every element of \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p^* \\). Therefore, to prove that \\( 3 \\) is a primitive root, we need to show that its order is exactly \\( p-1 \\).\n\n**Determining the Order of \\( 3 \\) Modulo \\( p \\):**\nThe order of an element \\( a \\) in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p^* \\) is the smallest positive integer \\( k \\) such that \\( a^k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p} \\).

Understanding the Multiplicative Group Modulo \\( p \\):**\nFirst, consider the set of integers \\( \\{1, 2, \\ldots, p-1\\} \\) under multiplication modulo \\( p \\). This set forms a **multiplicative group** because:\n- Every element has a multiplicative inverse modulo \\( p \\).\n- The operation is associative.\n- There is an identity element, which is \\( 1 \\).\n\nImportantly, this group is **cyclic** and has an order of \\( p-1 \\). This means there exists an element (a **primitive root**) in the group such that every other element can be expressed as a power of this primitive root.\n\n**2. Applying Fermat's Little Theorem:**\nFermat's Little Theorem tells us that for any integer \\( a \\) not divisible by \\( p \\), \\( a^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p} \\). This implies that raising any element of our multiplicative group to the power of \\( p-1 \\) returns \\( 1 \\) modulo \\( p \\).\n\n**3. Case 1: When \\( p-1 \\) Divides \\( k \\):**\nIf \\( k \\) is a multiple of \\( p-1 \\) (i.e., \\( k = m(p-1) \\) for some integer \\( m \\)), then:\n\\[ a^{k} = a^{m(p-1)} = \\left(a^{p-1}\\right)^m \\equiv 1^{m} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p} \\]\nfor every \\( a \\) in \\( \\{1, 2, \\ldots, p-1\\} \\).\n\nTherefore, the sum becomes:\n\\[ 1^{k} + 2^{k} + \\cdots + (p-1)^{k} \\equiv 1 + 1 + \\cdots + 1 \\pmod{p} \\]\nThere are \\( p-1 \\) terms, so:\n\\[ \\equiv (p-1) \\times 1 = p-1 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p} \\]\nThus, when \\( p-1 \\) divides \\( k \\), the sum is congruent to \\( -1 \\) modulo \\( p \\).\n\n**4. Case 2: When \\( p-1 \\) Does Not Divide \\( k \\):**\nIf \\( p-1 \\) does not divide \\( k \\), then the exponent \\( k \\) does not align with the group's order. In such cases, the map \\( a \\mapsto a^{k} \\) acts as a **non-trivial automorphism** of the group. This means that as you raise each element to the power \\( k \\), you effectively permute the elements of the group without fixing any non-identity elements.\n\nIn such scenarios, the sum of all distinct elements of the group after this permutation remains:\n\\[ 1^{k} + 2^{k} + \\cdots + (p-1)^{k} \\equiv 1 + 2 + \\cdots + (p-1) \\pmod{p} \\]\nHowever, because the mapping is a permutation and the group is cyclic, the sum of all these permuted elements modulo \\( p \\) must cancel out to:\n\\[ \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p} \\]\nThis cancellation occurs because the non-trivial automorphism ensures that every element \\( a \\) is paired with its inverse \\( a^{-1} \\), and their sum modulo \\( p \\) is \\( 0 \\).\n\n**5.

This involves exploring the properties of Gaussian integers and the factorization of primes in the ring \\( \\mathbb{Z}[i] \\), where \\( i = \\sqrt{-1} \\).

The specific form \\( A^{2} + 64 B^{2} \\) ensures that certain quadratic forms and residue conditions are satisfied, facilitating the existence of an integer \\( x \\) such that \\( x^{4} \\equiv 2 \\pmod{p} \\).\n\n2. **Constructing the Solution:**\n   By leveraging the representation \\( p = A^{2} + 64 B^{2} \\) and applying techniques similar to those used in Fermat's Two Squares Theorem, we can construct an explicit solution \\( x \\) to the congruence \\( x^{4} \\equiv 2 \\pmod{p} \\). This construction often involves descent arguments, where one shows that if a solution exists for a larger modulus, it must also exist for a smaller one, eventually leading to a solution modulo \\( p \\).\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   Therefore, the ability to express \\( p \\) as \\( A^{2} + 64 B^{2} \\) guarantees that \\( 2 \\) is a biquadratic residue modulo \\( p \\), ensuring the existence of an integer \\( x \\) satisfying \\( x^{4} \\equiv 2 \\pmod{p} \\).\n\n**Summary:**\n\nWe have shown that for a prime \\( p \\) congruent to 1 modulo 4, the existence of an integer \\( x \\) satisfying \\( x^{4} \\equiv 2 \\pmod{p} \\) is tightly linked to the representation of \\( p \\) in the form \\( A^{2} + 64 B^{2} \\).

Since \\( f \\) is non-negative everywhere, \\( x = 0 \\) is a local minimum or a flat point for \\( f \\).\n\n2. **At \\( x = 1 \\):** We have \\( f(1) = 1 \\). This point represents a specific positive value that \\( f \\) attains.\n\nTo transition smoothly from \\( f(0) = 0 \\) to \\( f(1) = 1 \\) while maintaining \\( f(x) \\geq 0 \\) everywhere, the function \\( f \\) must increase at some point in the interval \\( (0, 1) \\). However, because \\( f \\) starts at zero and reaches a positive value, the rate of change (i.e., the first derivative) must reflect this transition.\n\nAssume, for the sake of contradiction, that all derivatives of \\( f \\) are non-negative everywhere. If every derivative \\( f^{(n)}(x) \\) is non-negative, then the function would be increasing in a very controlled manner. Specifically:\n\n- A non-negative first derivative \\( f'(x) \\geq 0 \\) ensures that \\( f \\) is non-decreasing.\n- A non-negative second derivative \\( f''(x) \\geq 0 \\) implies that the function is concave upward.\n- This pattern continues for higher-order derivatives, enforcing increasingly rigid constraints on the function's shape.\n\nHowever, such constraints make it impossible for \\( f \\) to start at zero, increase to one, and remain non-negative without eventually \"flattening out\" too much. To achieve the increase from \\( f(0) = 0 \\) to \\( f(1) = 1 \\), there must be some point in the domain where the function's curvature changes in a way that requires at least one derivative to be negative.\n\nIn other words, to transition from a flat or increasing behavior near \\( x = 0 \\) to achieving a positive slope that leads to \\( f(1) = 1 \\), the function must bend or adjust its curvature. This bending necessitates that at some order \\( n \\), the \\( n \\)-th derivative \\( f^{(n)}(x) \\) becomes negative at some point \\( x \\). This negative derivative indicates a change in the direction of the function's growth, allowing it to rise to the required value at \\( x = 1 \\).\n\nTherefore, our initial assumption that all derivatives are non-negative leads to a contradiction with the given conditions. Hence, there must exist some positive integer \\( n \\) and some real number \\( x \\) where the \\( n \\)-th derivative \\( f^{(n)}(x) \\) is negative.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "# Informal Proof:\n\nWe are given a sequence defined recursively with the initial terms \\( x_0 = 1 \\), \\( x_1 = x_2 = a \\), and for each \\( n \\geq 2 \\), the relation \\( x_{n+1} = 2x_n x_{n-1} - x_{n-2} \\). Our goal is to show that if any term \\( x_n \\) in this sequence is zero, then the entire sequence becomes periodic.\n\nLet's consider what happens when a term \\( x_n \\) becomes zero for some \\( n \\). Suppose \\( x_k = 0 \\) for some specific index \\( k \\). We'll examine the subsequent terms to see how the sequence behaves from this point onward.\n\nUsing the recursive formula:\n1. \\( x_{k+1} = 2x_k x_{k-1} - x_{k-2} \\). Since \\( x_k = 0 \\), this simplifies to \\( x_{k+1} = -x_{k-2} \\).\n2. Next, \\( x_{k+2} = 2x_{k+1}x_k - x_{k-1} \\). Again, because \\( x_k = 0 \\), this becomes \\( x_{k+2} = -x_{k-1} \\).\n3. Continuing, \\( x_{k+3} = 2x_{k+2}x_{k+1} - x_k \\). Substituting \\( x_k = 0 \\), we get \\( x_{k+3} = 2(-x_{k-1})(-x_{k-2}) - 0 = 2x_{k-1}x_{k-2} \\).\n\nHowever, notice that \\( x_{k+3} \\) is expressed in terms of previous terms, and this pattern begins to repeat the relationships among earlier terms. Specifically, after \\( x_k = 0 \\), each new term is determined by flipping the sign of certain earlier terms or maintaining their relationships in a consistent pattern.\n\nThis repetition implies that after \\( x_k = 0 \\), the sequence doesn't introduce any new values but instead cycles through a set of existing values in a fixed order. The operations involved are linear and depend solely on preceding terms, ensuring that the sequence doesn't diverge or become chaotic but instead follows a predictable, repeating pattern.\n\nTherefore, once a zero appears in the sequence, the recursive relation causes the sequence to enter a loop where the values repeat indefinitely. This repetition is the essence of periodicity. Hence, if any term \\( x_n \\) in the sequence is zero, the sequence must be periodic from that point onward.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unsolved goals\ncase h.zero\na : \u211d\nx : \u2115 \u2192 \u211d\nhx0 : x 0 = a\nhx1 : x 1 = a\nn : \u2115\nhxn : \u2200 (n : \u2115), 2 \u2264 n \u2192 x (n + 1) = 2 * x n * x (n - 1) - x (n - 2)\nhn : x n = 0\n\u22a2 2 * x 2 * a - a = a\nunsolved goals\ncase h.succ.zero\na : \u211d\nx : \u2115 \u2192 \u211d\nhx0 : x 0 = a\nhx1 : x 1 = a\nn : \u2115\nhxn : \u2200 (n : \u2115), 2 \u2264 n \u2192 x (n + 1) = 2 * x n * x (n - 1) - x (n - 2)\nhn : x n = 0\nih : 2 * x 2 * a - a = a\n\u22a2 2 * a * x 2 - a = a\nunsolved goals\ncase h.succ.succ.zero\na : \u211d\nx : \u2115 \u2192 \u211d\nhx0 : x 0 = a\nhx1 : x 1 = a\nn : \u2115\nhxn : \u2200 (n : \u2115), 2 \u2264 n \u2192 x (n + 1) = 2 * x n * x (n - 1) - x (n - 2)\nhn : x n = 0\nih : 2 * (2 * x 2 * a - a) * x 2 - a = a\n\u22a2 2 * a * (2 * x 2 * a - a) - x 2 = x 2\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase h.succ.succ.succ.h1.h\na : \u211d\nx : \u2115 \u2192 \u211d\nhx0 : x 0 = a\nhx1 : x 1 = a\nn m : \u2115\nhxn : \u2200 (n : \u2115), 2 \u2264 n \u2192 x (n + 1) = 2 * x n * x (n - 1) - x (n - 2)\nhn : x n = 0\nih :\n  2 * (2 * (2 * x (m + 2) * x (m + 1) - x m) * x (m + 2) - x (m + 1)) * (2 * x (m + 2) * x (m + 1) - x m) - x (m + 2) =\n    x (m + 1 + 1)\na\u271d :\n  2 * x (m + 1 + 1) * (2 * (2 * x (m + 2) * x (m + 1) - x m) * x (m + 2) - x (m + 1)) -\n      (2 * x (m + 2) * x (m + 1) - x m) <\n    2 * x (m + 2) * x (m + 1) - x m\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unsolved goals\ncase h.zero\na : \u211d\nx : \u2115 \u2192 \u211d\nm : \u2115\nhx0 : 0 = a\nhx1 : x 1 = a\nhxn : \u2200 (n : \u2115), 2 \u2264 n \u2192 x (n + 1) = 2 * x n * x (n - 1) - x (n - 2)\nhn : x 0 = a\n\u22a2 x (m + 2) = x m\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase h.succ.h1.h\na : \u211d\nx : \u2115 \u2192 \u211d\nhx0 : x 0 = a\nhx1 : x 1 = a\nm n : \u2115\nhxn : \u2200 (n : \u2115), 2 \u2264 n \u2192 x (n + 1) = 2 * x n * x (n - 1) - x (n - 2)\nih : x n = 0 \u2192 x (m + 2) = x m\nhn : x (n + 1) = 0\na\u271d : x (m + 2) < x m\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unsolved goals\ncase h.zero\na : \u211d\nx : \u2115 \u2192 \u211d\nm : \u2115\nhx0 : 0 = a\nhx1 : x 1 = a\nhxn : \u2200 (n : \u2115), 2 \u2264 n \u2192 x (n + 1) = 2 * x n * x (n - 1) - x (n - 2)\nhn : x 0 = a\n\u22a2 x (m + 2) = x m\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase h.succ.h1.h\na : \u211d\nx : \u2115 \u2192 \u211d\nhx0 : x 0 = a\nhx1 : x 1 = a\nm n : \u2115\nhxn : \u2200 (n : \u2115), 2 \u2264 n \u2192 x (n + 1) = 2 * x n * x (n - 1) - x (n - 2)\nih : x n = 0 \u2192 x (m + 2) = x m\nhn : x (n + 1) = 0\na\u271d : x (m + 2) < x m\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nPlease revise the proof.",

Ensure that it's clear how * operates on any two elements of the set.\n\n2. **Apply the Operation Step-by-Step:**\n   - **Left Side:** Compute \\( a * (b * c) \\) by first finding \\( b * c \\), then applying * to \\( a \\) and this result.\n   - **Right Side:** Compute \\( (a * b) * (a * c) \\) by first finding \\( a * b \\) and \\( a * c \\), then applying * to these two intermediate results.\n\n3. **Show Equality:**\n   - Demonstrate that the outcome of the left side is equal to the outcome of the right side. This typically involves algebraic manipulation, substitution based on the operation's definition, or other logical deductions.\n\n4. **Generalization:**\n   - Since the property must hold for all \\( a, b, c \\), ensure that the steps taken do not rely on specific values but are universally applicable within the set.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Summarize that, based on the above steps, the operation * satisfies the left self-distributive property.\n\n**Example Illustration:**\nSuppose we define the operation * as follows for elements in a set:\n\n\\[\na * b = a + b - ab\n\\]\n\nTo check if this operation is left self-distributive:\n\n- **Left Side:**\n  \\[\n  a * (b * c) = a + (b * c) - a(b * c) = a + (b + c - bc) - a(b + c - bc)\n  \\]\n  \n- **Right Side:**\n  \\[\n  (a * b) * (a * c) = [a + b - ab] * [a + c - ac] = (a + b - ab) + (a + c - ac) - (a + b - ab)(a + c - ac)\n  \\]\n\nAfter simplifying both sides, if they are equal for all \\( a, b, c \\), then * is left self-distributive.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** The above is a general framework.

If \\( f'(x) \\) were to be \\( 2f(x) \\) or larger, \\( f(x) \\) would be increasing very rapidly.\n   - However, \\( f'''(x) \\leq f(x) \\) limits the acceleration of \\( f''(x) \\). Since \\( f''(x) \\) is the derivative of \\( f'(x) \\), this means that the increase in \\( f'(x) \\) is controlled and cannot outpace the growth dictated by \\( f(x) \\).\n\n4. **Deriving a Contradiction:**\n   - Given that \\( f'''(x) \\) is bounded by \\( f(x) \\), the growth rate of \\( f''(x) \\) is also limited. This ensures that \\( f'(x) \\) cannot escalate too quickly.\n   - If \\( f'(x) \\) were to reach or exceed \\( 2f(x) \\), the controlled growth of \\( f''(x) \\) would prevent \\( f'(x) \\) from maintaining such a high rate indefinitely. Essentially, \\( f'(x) \\) would not have the \"push\" needed to stay above \\( 2f(x) \\) because \\( f'''(x) \\) isn't large enough to sustain that increase.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since assuming \\( f'(x) \\geq 2f(x) \\) leads to a scenario where the growth of \\( f'(x) \\) cannot be maintained without violating the condition \\( f'''(x) \\leq f(x) \\), our initial assumption must be false.\n   - Therefore, it must be that \\( f'(x) < 2f(x) \\) for all \\( x \\).\n\nThis reasoning shows that under the given conditions, the first derivative of \\( f \\) is always less than twice the function itself.\nPrevious attempt failed with: linarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase h\nf : \u211d \u2192 \u211d\nhf : ContDiff \u211d 3 f\nhf1 : \u2200 n \u2264 3, \u2200 (x : \u211d), iteratedDeriv n f x > 0\nhf2 : \u2200 (x : \u211d), iteratedDeriv 3 f x \u2264 f x\nx : \u211d\nh1 : iteratedDeriv 1 f x > 0\nh2 : iteratedDeriv 2 f x > 0\nh3 : iteratedDeriv 3 f x > 0\nh4 : iteratedDeriv 3 f x \u2264 f x\na\u271d : deriv f x \u2265 2 * f x\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

As \\( n \\) increases, the \\( n^3 \\) term dominates the growth of the polynomial, meaning the entire expression grows roughly on the order of \\( n^3 \\).\n\nOn the other hand, perfect squares grow quadratically, like \\( m^2 \\), where \\( m \\) is an integer. The key insight here is that the cubic growth of our polynomial outpaces the quadratic growth of perfect squares. This means that as \\( n \\) becomes larger, the values of \\( n^3 + a n^2 + b n + c \\) will increase much more rapidly than the spacing between consecutive perfect squares.\n\nSince perfect squares become sparser relative to the values of our cubic polynomial for large \\( n \\), there will eventually be values of \\( n \\) where \\( n^3 + a n^2 + b n + c \\) falls strictly between two consecutive perfect squares. When this happens, the square root of \\( n^3 + a n^2 + b n + c \\) cannot be an integer because it's squeezed between two whole number squares without actually being a square itself.\n\nTherefore, no matter what integers \\( a, b, c \\) you choose, by selecting sufficiently large \\( n \\), you can ensure that \\( n^3 + a n^2 + b n + c \\) is not a perfect square. This guarantees the existence of at least one positive integer \\( n \\) for which \\( \\sqrt{n^3 + a n^2 + b n + c} \\) is not an integer.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unsolved goals\na b c m : \u2124\nhm : \u221a(1 + \u2191a + \u2191b + \u2191c) = \u2191m\n\u22a2 1 = \u221a(1 + \u2191a + \u2191b + \u2191c)\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase h.right.intro\na b c m : \u2124\nhm : \u221a(1 + \u2191a + \u2191b + \u2191c) = \u2191m\nthis : 1 = \u2191m\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: linarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase h1.h\na b c m : \u2124\nhm : \u221a(1 + \u2191a + \u2191b + \u2191c) = \u2191m\na\u271d : 1 < \u221a(1 + \u2191a + \u2191b + \u2191c)\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase h1.h\na b c m : \u2124\nhm : \u221a(1 + \u2191a + \u2191b + \u2191c) = \u2191m\nthis : 1 = \u221a(1 + \u2191a + \u2191b + \u2191c)\nh1 : 1 \u2265 0\nh2 : \u221a(1 + \u2191a + \u2191b + \u2191c) \u2265 0\na\u271d : 1 ^ 2 < 1 + \u2191a + \u2191b + \u2191c\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase h.right.intro\na b c m : \u2124\nhm : \u221a(1 + \u2191a + \u2191b + \u2191c) = \u2191m\nthis : 1 = \u221a(1 + \u2191a + \u2191b + \u2191c)\nh1 : 1 \u2265 0\nh2 : \u221a(1 + \u2191a + \u2191b + \u2191c) \u2265 0\nh3 : 1 ^ 2 = 1 + \u2191a + \u2191b + \u2191c\nh4 : \u221a(1 + \u2191a + \u2191b + \u2191c) ^ 2 = 1 + \u2191a + \u2191b + \u2191c\nh5 : 1 ^ 2 = \u221a(1 + \u2191a + \u2191b + \u2191c) ^ 2\nh6 : 1 = \u221a(1 + \u2191a + \u2191b + \u2191c)\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nPlease revise the proof.",
