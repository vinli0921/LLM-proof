        "informal_proof": "# Informal Proof:\nTo solve this problem, we need to compare two averages: the average of the lowest and highest scores, and the average score of the entire class.\n\nFirst, let's define what we have:\n- The lowest score in the class is 45.\n- The highest score in the class is 100.\n- There are 30 students in total.\n\nThe average of the lowest and highest scores is calculated as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Average of lowest and highest scores} = \\frac{45 + 100}{2} = \\frac{145}{2} = 72.5. \\]\n\nNow, let's consider the average score of the entire class. The average score is the sum of all the students' scores divided by the number of students, which is 30. We don't know the exact scores of all the students, but we do know that each score is at least 45 and at most 100.\n\nTo show that the average of the lowest and highest scores (72.5) is less than or equal to the average score of the class, we can use the following reasoning:\n\n1. **Distribution of Scores**: The scores are spread between 45 and 100. If the scores are evenly distributed or skewed towards higher values, the class average will be higher. If they are skewed towards lower values, the class average will be lower.\n\n2. **Extreme Case Analysis**: Consider the extreme case where all students score either 45 or 100. If all students scored 45, the class average would be 45, which is less than 72.5. However, this is not possible because we know the highest score is 100. If all students scored 100, the class average would be 100, which is greater than 72.5.\n\n3. **Balanced Distribution**: For the class average to be exactly 72.5, the scores would need to be perfectly balanced around this value. However, since the scores range from 45 to 100, any distribution that includes scores higher than 72.5 will increase the class average above 72.5.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since the scores range from 45 to 100, and the average of the lowest and highest scores is 72.5, the class average, which considers all scores, will naturally tend to be higher than 72.5 unless all scores are exactly 72.5, which is unlikely given the range. Therefore, the average score of the class is at least 72.5, and likely higher, confirming that the average of the lowest and highest scores is less than or equal to the class average.\n\nThus, we have shown that the average of the lowest and highest scores is less than or equal to the average score of the class.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  HDiv \u2115 \u2115 Float\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  HDiv \u2115 \u2115 Float\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  OfScientific \u2115\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase refine_1\nscores : List \u2115\nh : scores.length = numStudents\nh_range : \u2200 s \u2208 scores, s \u2265 lowestScore \u2227 s \u2264 highestScore\nsum : \u2115 := List.foldl (fun x x_1 => x + x_1) 0 scores\navg : \u2115 := sum / numStudents\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown constant 'Nat.le_of_forall_le_of_dense'\ntactic 'apply' failed, failed to unify\n  ?m / ?k \u2264 ?n\nwith\n  scores.sum / 30 \u2265 45\nscores : List \u2115\nh : scores.length = 30\nh_range : \u2200 s \u2208 scores, s \u2265 45 \u2227 s \u2264 100\nh_sum : 45 * 30 \u2264 scores.sum\n\u22a2 scores.sum / 30 \u2265 45\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase a.a\nscores : List \u2115\nh : scores.length = 30\nh_range : \u2200 s \u2208 scores, s \u2265 45 \u2227 s \u2264 100\nh_sum : 45 * 30 \u2264 scores.sum\nh_avg : scores.sum / 30 \u2265 45\na\u271d : scores.sum > 30 * 100\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\ntactic 'apply' failed, failed to unify\n  ?a / ?c \u2264 ?b / ?c\nwith\n  (45 + 100) / 2 \u2264 scores.sum / 30\nscores : List \u2115\nh : scores.length = 30\nh_range : \u2200 s \u2208 scores, s \u2265 45 \u2227 s \u2264 100\nh_sum : 45 * 30 \u2264 scores.sum\nh_avg : scores.sum / 30 \u2265 45\nh_avg_le : scores.sum / 30 \u2264 100\n\u22a2 (45 + 100) / 2 \u2264 scores.sum / 30\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown constant 'Nat.le_of_forall_le_of_dense'\napplication type mismatch\n  Nat.div_le_of_le_mul h_sum\nargument\n  h_sum\nhas type\n  45 * 30 \u2264 scores.sum : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  45 * 30 \u2264 ?m.627 * ?m.626 : Prop\nsimp made no progress\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase a\nscores : List \u2115\nh : scores.length = 30\nh_range : \u2200 s \u2208 scores, s \u2265 45 \u2227 s \u2264 100\nh_sum : 45 * 30 \u2264 scores.sum\nh_avg : scores.sum / 30 \u2265 45\nh_avg_le : scores.sum / 30 \u2264 100\na\u271d : (45 + 100) / 2 > scores.sum / 30\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nPlease revise the proof.",

The degree of the polynomial is the highest power of \\( x \\) with a non-zero coefficient, which in this case is \\( n \\).\n\nOne fundamental property of polynomials is the Factor Theorem, which states that if \\( r \\) is a root of the polynomial \\( P(x) \\), then \\( (x - r) \\) is a factor of \\( P(x) \\). This means that if a polynomial has a root \\( r \\), it can be expressed as:\n\\[ P(x) = (x - r)Q(x), \\]\nwhere \\( Q(x) \\) is another polynomial of degree \\( n-1 \\).\n\nNow, if \\( P(x) \\) has \\( n+1 \\) distinct roots, say \\( r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_{n+1} \\), then by the Factor Theorem, we can express \\( P(x) \\) as:\n\\[ P(x) = (x - r_1)(x - r_2) \\cdots (x - r_{n+1})R(x), \\]\nwhere \\( R(x) \\) is some polynomial.\n\nHowever, notice that the expression \\((x - r_1)(x - r_2) \\cdots (x - r_{n+1})\\) itself is a polynomial of degree \\( n+1 \\) because it is the product of \\( n+1 \\) linear factors. This means that if \\( R(x) \\) is not the zero polynomial, the degree of \\( P(x) \\) would be at least \\( n+1 \\), which contradicts our initial assumption that \\( P(x) \\) is of degree \\( n \\).\n\nThe only way to resolve this contradiction is if \\( R(x) \\) is the zero polynomial. If \\( R(x) \\) is zero, then:\n\\[ P(x) = 0 \\cdot (x - r_1)(x - r_2) \\cdots (x - r_{n+1}) = 0. \\]\n\nThus, \\( P(x) \\) must be the zero polynomial. This means that all coefficients of \\( P(x) \\) are zero, and it has no non-zero terms. Therefore, a polynomial of degree \\( n \\) cannot have more than \\( n \\) distinct roots unless it is the zero polynomial.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown constant 'Polynomial.eq_zero_of_has_roots_of_degree_lt'\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: invalid field notation, function 'Multiset.card' does not have argument with type (Multiset ...) that can be used, it must be explicit or implicit with a unique name\ninvalid field notation, function 'Multiset.card' does not have argument with type (Multiset ...) that can be used, it must be explicit or implicit with a unique name\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  P.degree\nP : Polynomial \u2124\nn : \u2115\nhn : P.degree = \u2191n\nhP : sorryAx \u2115 true = n + 1\n\u22a2 sorryAx \u2115 true \u2264 n\nfailed to synthesize\n  LinearOrder (Polynomial \u2124)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: expected token\nPlease revise the proof.",

If we simply add the number of students who wore red shirts on Monday (10 students) to the number who wore them on Tuesday (15 students), we would get 25. However, this sum assumes that no student wore a red shirt on both days, which might not be the case.\n\nTo find the correct total, we should use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. This principle helps us account for any overlap between the two groups of students (those who wore red shirts on Monday and those who wore them on Tuesday).\n\n1. **Count the total for each day separately**: \n   - On Monday, 10 students wore a red shirt.\n   - On Tuesday, 15 students wore a red shirt.\n\n2. **Consider the overlap**: \n   - Some students might have worn a red shirt on both Monday and Tuesday. Let's denote the number of such students as \\( x \\).\n\n3. **Apply the principle of inclusion-exclusion**:\n   - The total number of distinct students who wore a red shirt on either day is given by:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total} = (\\text{Number on Monday}) + (\\text{Number on Tuesday}) - (\\text{Number on both days})\n     \\]\n   - Substituting the known values, we have:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total} = 10 + 15 - x\n     \\]\n\n4. **Determine the overlap**:\n   - Since we don't have specific information about how many students wore a red shirt on both days, we can't determine \\( x \\) exactly without additional data. However, we can say that the maximum possible overlap is 10, because only 10 students wore a red shirt on Monday. Therefore, the minimum number of distinct students who wore a red shirt over the two days is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Minimum Total} = 10 + 15 - 10 = 15\n     \\]\n   - The maximum number of distinct students, assuming no overlap, is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Maximum Total} = 10 + 15 = 25\n     \\]\n\nThus, without additional information, we can conclude that the number of distinct students who wore a red shirt on either Monday or Tuesday is between 15 and 25.

Since these points are on a number line, they represent positions along a single dimension, which means the rectangle is essentially a line segment in this context.\n\nTo determine the perimeter, we need to identify the lengths of the sides of the rectangle. On a number line, the distance between two points is simply the absolute difference between their values. \n\nLet's first find the lengths of the sides of the rectangle:\n\n1. **Length of one side (between -4 and -1):**\n   - The distance between -4 and -1 is calculated as the absolute difference: |-4 - (-1)| = |-4 + 1| = |-3| = 3.\n\n2. **Length of the other side (between 3 and 6):**\n   - Similarly, the distance between 3 and 6 is: |3 - 6| = |-3| = 3.\n\nNow, we have two sides of the rectangle, each with a length of 3. However, since the rectangle is on a number line, it doesn't have a traditional width and height like a two-dimensional rectangle. Instead, the \"rectangle\" here is more like a line segment with endpoints at the farthest vertices.\n\nTo find the total perimeter, we consider the entire span from the leftmost point to the rightmost point:\n\n- The leftmost point is -4, and the rightmost point is 6. The distance between these two points is: |-4 - 6| = |-10| = 10.\n\nIn a typical two-dimensional rectangle, the perimeter is calculated as twice the sum of the lengths of the two different sides. However, since this is a one-dimensional representation, the perimeter is simply the total length of the line segment from the leftmost to the rightmost point.\n\nTherefore, the perimeter of the rectangle, in this context, is 10.",

The derivative of \\( e^x \\) with respect to \\( x \\) is a well-known result in calculus: it is \\( e^x \\) itself.

Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, identify the key components of the problem. We have a set of assumptions or premises, and we need to derive a conclusion from these. The assumptions might involve properties of numbers, sets, functions, or other mathematical objects, and the conclusion is typically a statement that follows logically from these assumptions.\n\nNext, consider each assumption individually and think about what it implies. Often, assumptions can be used to simplify the problem or to establish intermediate results that are useful for proving the final conclusion. For example, if an assumption states that a certain function is continuous, we might use this to argue about the behavior of the function at specific points or over certain intervals.\n\nOnce we have a clear understanding of the assumptions, we can start constructing the proof. A good strategy is to work backwards from the conclusion. Ask yourself: what needs to be true for the conclusion to hold? Then, see if you can connect these necessary conditions back to the assumptions.\n\nAs you build the proof, make sure each step logically follows from the previous ones. If you encounter a step that seems unclear or unjustified, try to break it down further or find a different approach. It's important to ensure that every part of the proof is supported by either an assumption or a previously established result.\n\nFinally, review the entire proof to make sure it is coherent and complete. Check that all assumptions have been used appropriately and that the conclusion is indeed a logical consequence of these assumptions.

The student studies 3 pages per hour, and for each page, he has a probability of 0.8 of remembering it. \n\n1. **Understanding f(x):** \n   - f(x) is the probability that the student remembers at least x pages after studying for one hour. Since he studies 3 pages in an hour, the possible outcomes for the number of pages he remembers are 0, 1, 2, or 3.\n\n2. **Probability Distribution:**\n   - The probability of remembering exactly k pages out of 3 can be modeled using a binomial distribution, where the number of trials n is 3 (pages), and the probability of success (remembering a page) p is 0.8.\n   - The probability of remembering exactly k pages is given by the binomial probability formula: \n     \\[\n     P(\\text{remember } k \\text{ pages}) = \\binom{3}{k} (0.8)^k (0.2)^{3-k}\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, f(x) is the sum of probabilities of remembering k pages for k \u2265 x.\n\n3. **Calculating f(x) for x = 3:**\n   - f(3) is the probability of remembering at least 3 pages, which is the same as remembering exactly 3 pages:\n     \\[\n     f(3) = P(\\text{remember 3 pages}) = \\binom{3}{3} (0.8)^3 (0.2)^0 = 1 \\times 0.512 \\times 1 = 0.512\n     \\]\n\n4. **Derivative of f(x):**\n   - To find the derivative of f(x) at x = 3, we need to consider how f(x) changes as x changes. Since f(x) is a step function (it jumps at integer values of x), the derivative is not defined in the traditional sense at these points. However, we can consider the change in probability as x increases.\n   - For x < 3, f(x) = 1 (since the student can remember at least 0, 1, or 2 pages with probability 1). For x = 3, f(x) = 0.512. Thus, the function drops from 1 to 0.512 at x = 3.\n   - The derivative at x = 3 can be thought of as the rate of change of f(x) at this point, which is a drop of 0.488 (from 1 to 0.512) over an infinitesimally small interval. However, since f(x) is a step function, the derivative is technically undefined at x = 3.\n\n5. **If the derivative is a constant:**\n   - If we assume the derivative of f(x) is a constant, it implies that f(x) is a linear function. However, given the nature of f(x) as a step function, this assumption doesn't hold in the context of this problem. The derivative being a constant would imply a continuous linear change, which is not the case here.\n\nIn conclusion, the derivative of f(x) at x = 3 is not defined in the traditional sense due to the step nature of the function. If we were to assume a constant derivative, it would contradict the step function nature of f(x). Therefore, the problem as stated does not support a constant derivative value.",

These conditions are crucial because they ensure that the function behaves nicely without any jumps, breaks, or sharp corners, which allows us to apply certain theorems.\n\nWe are given two points, `a` and `b`, in the domain of `f(x)`, and we know that the function takes the same value at these points, i.e., `f(a) = f(b)`. This means that the function starts and ends at the same height on the graph over the interval `[a, b]`.\n\nNow, let's visualize what this means. Imagine drawing the graph of `f(x)` from `x = a` to `x = b`. Since `f(a) = f(b)`, the graph starts and ends at the same vertical level. Because the function is continuous, the graph must be a smooth curve connecting these two points.\n\nRolle's Theorem tells us that if a function is continuous on a closed interval `[a, b]`, differentiable on the open interval `(a, b)`, and the function values at the endpoints are equal (`f(a) = f(b)`), then there must be at least one point `c` in the open interval `(a, b)` where the derivative `f'(c) = 0`.\n\nIntuitively, this makes sense because if the function starts and ends at the same height, the graph must have at least one point where it changes direction. This change in direction is where the slope of the tangent to the curve is zero, meaning the derivative at that point is zero. \n\nThink of it like a hill or a valley: if you start and end at the same elevation, you must have reached a peak or a trough somewhere in between. At the peak or trough, the slope of the hill (or valley) is flat, which corresponds to the derivative being zero.\n\nTherefore, by applying Rolle's Theorem, we conclude that there is at least one point `c` in the interval `(a, b)` where the derivative `f'(c) = 0`. This completes our informal proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: function expected at\n  Icc\nterm has type\n  ?m.386\nfunction expected at\n  Ioo\nterm has type\n  ?m.894\nfunction expected at\n  Ioo\nterm has type\n  ?m.894\nfunction expected at\n  Ioo\nterm has type\n  x\u271d\nunsolved goals\nx\u271d\u00b9 : Sort u_1\nIcc : x\u271d\u00b9\nx\u271d : Sort u_2\nIoo : x\u271d\nf : \u211d \u2192 \u211d\na b : \u211d\nhab : a < b\nhf : ContinuousOn f (sorryAx (Set \u211d) true)\nhf' : DifferentiableOn \u211d f (sorryAx (Set \u211d) true)\nhfa : f a = f b\n\u22a2 \u2203 c \u2208 ?m.3630 f a b hab hf hf' hfa c, deriv f c = 0\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: function expected at\n  Icc\nterm has type\n  ?m.386\nfunction expected at\n  Ioo\nterm has type\n  ?m.894\nfunction expected at\n  Ioo\nterm has type\n  ?m.894\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown namespace 'Set'\nexpected token\nPlease revise the proof.",

Using the properties of exponents, we know that:\n- \\(b^p\\) means \\(b\\) raised to the power of \\(p\\).\n- \\(c^q\\) means \\(c\\) raised to the power of \\(q\\).\n\nNow, using the property of logarithms that states \\(\\log_a(x \\cdot y) = \\log_a(x) + \\log_a(y)\\), we can split the logarithm of a product into the sum of logarithms:\n\\[\n\\log_a(b^p \\cdot c^q) = \\log_a(b^p) + \\log_a(c^q)\n\\]\n\nNext, we apply another property of logarithms: \\(\\log_a(x^k) = k \\cdot \\log_a(x)\\). This property allows us to bring the exponent down as a coefficient:\n- For \\(\\log_a(b^p)\\), we have:\n  \\[\n  \\log_a(b^p) = p \\cdot \\log_a(b)\n  \\]\n  Since \\(\\log_a(b) = m\\), this becomes:\n  \\[\n  \\log_a(b^p) = p \\cdot m\n  \\]\n\n- Similarly, for \\(\\log_a(c^q)\\), we have:\n  \\[\n  \\log_a(c^q) = q \\cdot \\log_a(c)\n  \\]\n  Since \\(\\log_a(c) = n\\), this becomes:\n  \\[\n  \\log_a(c^q) = q \\cdot n\n  \\]\n\nNow, we combine these results:\n\\[\n\\log_a(b^p \\cdot c^q) = \\log_a(b^p) + \\log_a(c^q) = p \\cdot m + q \\cdot n\n\\]\n\nThus, we have shown that \\(\\log_a(b^p \\cdot c^q) = p \\cdot m + q \\cdot n\\), which completes the proof.

        "informal_proof": "# Informal Proof:\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to understand the relationship between the given mathematical statements and how they can be logically connected to reach the desired conclusion. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, identify the key components of the problem. We have a set of assumptions or premises, and we need to derive a conclusion from these. The assumptions might involve properties of numbers, sets, functions, or other mathematical objects, and the conclusion is typically a statement that follows logically from these assumptions.\n\nNext, consider each assumption and how it contributes to the overall argument. For example, if we have an assumption about a function being continuous, we might use this to argue about the behavior of the function at certain points or over certain intervals. Similarly, if we have an assumption about a number being positive, we might use this to infer something about its square or its reciprocal.\n\nAs we analyze the assumptions, we look for logical connections between them. This might involve using known theorems or properties, such as the transitive property of equality, the distributive property of multiplication over addition, or the fact that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. These connections help us build a chain of reasoning that leads from the assumptions to the conclusion.\n\nThroughout this process, it's important to ensure that each step of the reasoning is justified. This means that we should be able to explain why each step follows from the previous ones, either by direct application of a known result or by a simple logical inference.\n\nFinally, once we have constructed a complete chain of reasoning from the assumptions to the conclusion, we have our informal proof. This proof should be clear and concise, with each step logically following from the previous ones, and it should convincingly demonstrate that the conclusion is true given the assumptions.\n\nIn summary, the informal proof involves carefully analyzing the assumptions, identifying logical connections between them, and constructing a clear and justified chain of reasoning that leads to the conclusion.\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  Nat.find factors\nargument\n  factors\nhas type\n  Set \u2115 : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u2203 n, ?m.189 n : Prop\nfailed to synthesize\n  Decidable factors.Nonempty\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\ntactic 'contradiction' failed\ncase h.mp.inl\nn : \u2115\nhn : is_prime n\nh : \u2200 (d : \u2115), d \u2223 n \u2192 d = 1 \u2228 d = n\nd : \u2115\nhd : d \u2208 {d | d > 1 \u2227 d \u2223 n}\nh1 : d = 1\n\u22a2 d \u2208 {n}\napplication type mismatch\n  And.intro (lt_succ_self 1)\nargument\n  lt_succ_self 1\nhas type\n  1 < succ 1 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  n > 1 : Prop\nunknown constant 'Set.nonempty_singleton'\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  if ?m.4982 then ?m.4986 else ?m.4987\nn : \u2115\nhn : is_prime n\nh : \u2200 (d : \u2115), d \u2223 n \u2192 d = 1 \u2228 d = n\nfactors : {d | d > 1 \u2227 d \u2223 n} = {n}\n\u22a2 sorryAx \u2115 true = n\nPlease revise the proof.",

The slope is determined by the change in \\( y \\) divided by the change in \\( x \\) between the two points. Given the points (2, 3) and (4, 7), we can calculate the slope as follows:\n\n1. Calculate the change in \\( y \\): \\( 7 - 3 = 4 \\).\n2. Calculate the change in \\( x \\): \\( 4 - 2 = 2 \\).\n3. Divide the change in \\( y \\) by the change in \\( x \\) to find the slope: \\( m = \\frac{4}{2} = 2 \\).\n\nNow that we have the slope \\( m = 2 \\), we can use one of the given points to find the equation of the line. Let's use the point (2, 3).\n\nSubstitute \\( m = 2 \\), \\( x_1 = 2 \\), and \\( y_1 = 3 \\) into the point-slope form equation:\n\n\\[ y - 3 = 2(x - 2) \\]\n\nNext, we simplify this equation to get it into the slope-intercept form, \\( y = mx + b \\):\n\n1.

Simplify the right side: \\( y = 2x - 1 \\).\n\nThus, the equation of the line passing through the points (2, 3) and (4, 7) is \\( y = 2x - 1 \\).

Here, \\( F(x, y, z) \\) is acting as a density function. In simpler terms, at any point \\((x, y, z)\\) within the region \\( A \\), the value of \\( F(x, y, z) \\) tells us how \"dense\" or \"concentrated\" the random variable \\( X \\) is at that point. This is analogous to how a probability density function works in one or two dimensions, but now we're extending this idea to three dimensions.\n\nThe expected value \\( E(X) \\) of a random variable is a measure of the \"average\" or \"mean\" value that the random variable takes. In the context of a continuous random variable with a density function, the expected value is calculated by integrating the product of the variable and its density over the entire space where the variable is defined. In simpler terms, it's like finding the weighted average of all possible values the random variable can take, where the weights are given by the density function.\n\nNow, in three dimensions, the expected value is found by integrating the density function over the entire region \\( A \\). This is where the triple integral comes into play. The triple integral \\(\\int\\int\\int_A F(x, y, z) \\, dV\\) sums up the density \\( F(x, y, z) \\) over every infinitesimally small volume element \\( dV \\) within the region \\( A \\). Each small volume element contributes to the total expected value based on how dense the random variable is at that point.\n\nTherefore, by integrating the density function \\( F(x, y, z) \\) over the entire region \\( A \\), we effectively calculate the expected value \\( E(X) \\) of the random variable \\( X \\). This is because the integral accumulates the density across the whole region, providing a comprehensive measure of the average value of the random variable across the space it occupies.\n\nIn summary, the expected value \\( E(X) \\) is equivalent to the triple integral of the density function \\( F(x, y, z) \\) over the region \\( A \\) because this integral captures the total \"weight\" or \"mass\" of the random variable distributed throughout the region, giving us the average value of the random variable in the space it occupies.\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  \u222b (z : \u211d) in A, F (x, y, z)\nargument\n  fun z => F (x, y, z)\nhas type\n  \u211d \u2192 \u211d : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u211d \u00d7 \u211d \u00d7 \u211d \u2192 \u211d : Type\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.RCLike', and it does not have executable code\napplication type mismatch\n  \u222b (z : \u211d) in A, F (x, y, z)\nargument\n  fun z => F (x, y, z)\nhas type\n  \u211d \u2192 \u211d : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u211d \u00d7 \u211d \u00d7 \u211d \u2192 \u211d : Type\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  \u222b (z : \u211d) in A, F (x, y, z)\nargument\n  fun z => F (x, y, z)\nhas type\n  \u211d \u2192 \u211d : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u211d \u00d7 \u211d \u00d7 \u211d \u2192 \u211d : Type\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.RCLike', and it does not have executable code\napplication type mismatch\n  \u222b (z : \u211d) in A, F (x, y, z)\nargument\n  fun z => F (x, y, z)\nhas type\n  \u211d \u2192 \u211d : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u211d \u00d7 \u211d \u00d7 \u211d \u2192 \u211d : Type\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  \u222b (z : \u211d) in A, F (x, y, z)\nargument\n  fun z => F (x, y, z)\nhas type\n  \u211d \u2192 \u211d : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u211d \u00d7 \u211d \u00d7 \u211d \u2192 \u211d : Type\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.RCLike', and it does not have executable code\napplication type mismatch\n  \u222b (z : \u211d) in A, F (x, y, z)\nargument\n  fun z => F (x, y, z)\nhas type\n  \u211d \u2192 \u211d : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u211d \u00d7 \u211d \u00d7 \u211d \u2192 \u211d : Type\nPlease revise the proof.",

The problem states that the ratio of the length to the width is 3:2, and the width is 120 feet.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the ratio 3:2 means. This ratio tells us that for every 3 units of length, there are 2 units of width. In other words, if we think of the width as being divided into parts, the length is divided into the same number of parts, but each part of the length is 1.5 times larger than each part of the width (since 3 divided by 2 equals 1.5).\n\nNow, let's use this ratio to find the length. We know the width is 120 feet, and according to the ratio, the width corresponds to 2 parts. Therefore, each part of the width is 120 feet divided by 2, which equals 60 feet.\n\nSince the length corresponds to 3 parts in the ratio, and each part is 60 feet (as calculated from the width), the total length is 3 times 60 feet.

In more concrete terms, if \\( x = \\begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\end{pmatrix} \\), then \\( f(x) = A \\begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\end{pmatrix} \\).\n\nThe derivative of a function at a point is essentially the best linear approximation of the function near that point. For a function from \\( \\mathbb{R}^2 \\) to \\( \\mathbb{R}^2 \\), the derivative at a point is represented by a 2x2 matrix. This matrix tells us how small changes in the input vector \\( x \\) result in changes in the output vector \\( f(x) \\).\n\nNow, since \\( f(x) = Ax \\) is already a linear function, it is its own best linear approximation. This means that the function behaves exactly like its linear approximation everywhere, not just near a specific point. Therefore, the derivative of \\( f \\) at any point \\( x \\) is simply the matrix \\( A \\) itself.\n\nTo see this more intuitively, consider a small change \\( h \\) in the input vector \\( x \\).

Thus, the matrix \\( A \\) directly describes how changes in the input affect changes in the output, which is precisely the role of the derivative.\n\nIn summary, because \\( f(x) = Ax \\) is a linear function, its derivative is constant and equal to the matrix \\( A \\) itself at every point in \\( \\mathbb{R}^2 \\).

A vector-valued function like \\( r(t) \\) is essentially a function that outputs a vector for each input \\( t \\). In this case, the vector has three components: \\( \\cos(t) \\), \\( \\sin(t) \\), and \\( t \\).

The partial derivative \\(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}\\) at a point \\((x, y)\\) is essentially the rate at which the function \\( f \\) changes as \\( x \\) changes, while \\( y \\) is held constant.\n\nThe expression \\(\\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(x+h, y) - f(x, y)}{h}\\) is known as the difference quotient. It represents the average rate of change of the function \\( f \\) with respect to \\( x \\) over a small interval \\( h \\). As \\( h \\) approaches zero, this average rate of change should approach the instantaneous rate of change, which is exactly what the partial derivative \\(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}\\) measures.\n\nNow, let's break down why this limit equals the partial derivative:\n\n1. **Existence of Partial Derivative**: We are given that the partial derivative \\(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}\\) exists at every point in \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\). This means that for any fixed \\( y \\), the function \\( f(x, y) \\) behaves nicely enough with respect to \\( x \\) that we can talk about its instantaneous rate of change.\n\n2. **Continuity of Partial Derivative**: The problem also states that \\(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}\\) is continuous. This continuity is crucial because it ensures that small changes in \\( x \\) (and hence small changes in \\( h \\)) lead to small changes in the value of the derivative. This continuity helps in making the transition from the average rate of change (difference quotient) to the instantaneous rate of change (partial derivative) smooth and reliable.\n\n3. **Limit Process**: As \\( h \\) approaches zero, the difference quotient \\(\\frac{f(x+h, y) - f(x, y)}{h}\\) becomes a better and better approximation of the derivative \\(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}(x, y)\\). This is because, by definition, the derivative is the limit of this difference quotient as \\( h \\) goes to zero.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since the partial derivative exists and is continuous, the limit of the difference quotient as \\( h \\) approaches zero must equal the partial derivative \\(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}(x, y)\\). This is a direct consequence of the definition of the derivative and the continuity condition, which ensures that the behavior of the function is well-behaved and predictable as \\( h \\) becomes very small.\n\nIn summary, the limit of the difference quotient as \\( h \\) approaches zero is equal to the partial derivative \\(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}\\) at the point \\((x, y)\\) because the partial derivative represents the exact rate of change of the function with respect to \\( x \\), and the continuity of the derivative ensures that this rate of change is consistent and smooth as we make \\( h \\) smaller and smaller.",

Multiplication is essentially a way of adding a number to itself a certain number of times. For example, if you multiply 3 by 4, you're adding 3 to itself 4 times: 3 + 3 + 3 + 3.\n\nNow, when you multiply a number by 1, you're essentially asking, \"How many times should I add this number to itself?\" The answer is just once. So, if you have a number, say x, and you multiply it by 1, you're just adding x to itself one time. This means you don't actually change the number at all; you just have x.\n\nAnother way to think about it is through the concept of identity in mathematics. The number 1 is known as the \"multiplicative identity.\" This means that when you multiply any number by 1, the identity property of multiplication tells us that the number remains unchanged. It's like saying, \"I have x, and I'm multiplying it by something that doesn't change it,\" which is exactly what multiplying by 1 does.\n\nFor example, if x is 5, then 5 * 1 is just 5. You're not adding or taking away anything from 5; you're simply keeping it as it is. This holds true for any number, whether it's a whole number, a fraction, a negative number, or even zero. Multiplying by 1 always leaves the number the same.\n\nIn summary, multiplying any number by 1 results in the original number because 1 is the multiplicative identity, meaning it doesn't alter the value of the number it's multiplied with.",

This formula tells us that the area \\( A \\) is a function of the radius \\( r \\).\n\nNow, we want to find out how the area changes as we slightly increase the radius. In mathematical terms, this is asking for the derivative of the area with respect to the radius, denoted as \\( \\frac{dA}{dr} \\).\n\nTo find this derivative, we apply the basic rules of differentiation to the function \\( A(r) = \\pi r^2 \\). The derivative of \\( r^2 \\) with respect to \\( r \\) is \\( 2r \\). Therefore, the derivative of \\( \\pi r^2 \\) with respect to \\( r \\) is \\( \\pi \\times 2r = 2\\pi r \\).\n\nThis result, \\( \\frac{dA}{dr} = 2\\pi r \\), tells us that the rate at which the area of the circle changes with respect to the radius is \\( 2\\pi r \\).\n\nNext, let's consider the circumference of the circle, which is given by the formula \\( C = 2\\pi r \\). Notice that the expression for the rate of change of the area, \\( 2\\pi r \\), is exactly the same as the expression for the circumference of the circle.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the rate of change of the area of the circle with respect to the radius is not just proportional to the circumference of the circle, but it is exactly equal to the circumference. This means that for every small increase in the radius, the increase in the area is directly related to the current circumference of the circle.\n\nIn summary, the derivative \\( \\frac{dA}{dr} = 2\\pi r \\) shows that the rate of change of the area with respect to the radius is equal to the circumference of the circle, demonstrating the proportional relationship between these two quantities.\nPrevious attempt failed with: ambiguous, possible interpretations \n  \u03c0 : \u2115 \u2192 \u2115\n  \n  \u03c0 : \u211d\nambiguous, possible interpretations \n  \u03c0 : \u2115 \u2192 \u2115\n  \n  \u03c0 : \u211d\nambiguous, possible interpretations \n  \u03c0 : \u2115 \u2192 \u2115\n  \n  \u03c0 : \u211d\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier '\u03c0'\nunknown identifier '\u03c0'\nunknown identifier '\u03c0'\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier '\u03c0'\nunknown identifier '\u03c0'\nunknown identifier '\u03c0'\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

The slope of this line indicates how much the y-value changes for a unit change in the x-value.\n\nLet's start with the first data set: (2,3), (4,7), (6,11).\n\n1. **Calculate the slope for the first data set:**\n   - The slope of the line of best fit can be calculated using the formula for the slope (m) in linear regression:\n     \\[\n     m = \\frac{n(\\sum xy) - (\\sum x)(\\sum y)}{n(\\sum x^2) - (\\sum x)^2}\n     \\]\n   - Here, \\( n \\) is the number of points, which is 3 for this data set.\n   - Calculate the necessary sums:\n     - \\(\\sum x = 2 + 4 + 6 = 12\\)\n     - \\(\\sum y = 3 + 7 + 11 = 21\\)\n     - \\(\\sum xy = (2 \\times 3) + (4 \\times 7) + (6 \\times 11) = 6 + 28 + 66 = 100\\)\n     - \\(\\sum x^2 = 2^2 + 4^2 + 6^2 = 4 + 16 + 36 = 56\\)\n   - Plug these into the formula:\n     \\[\n     m = \\frac{3(100) - (12)(21)}{3(56) - (12)^2} = \\frac{300 - 252}{168 - 144} = \\frac{48}{24} = 2\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the slope for the second data set: (1,2), (2,4), (3,6):**\n   - Again, use the same formula for the slope.\n   - Calculate the necessary sums:\n     - \\(\\sum x = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6\\)\n     - \\(\\sum y = 2 + 4 + 6 = 12\\)\n     - \\(\\sum xy = (1 \\times 2) + (2 \\times 4) + (3 \\times 6) = 2 + 8 + 18 = 28\\)\n     - \\(\\sum x^2 = 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 = 1 + 4 + 9 = 14\\)\n   - Plug these into the formula:\n     \\[\n     m = \\frac{3(28) - (6)(12)}{3(14) - (6)^2} = \\frac{84 - 72}{42 - 36} = \\frac{12}{6} = 2\n     \\]\n\nBoth data sets have a slope of 2 for their lines of best fit. Therefore, the slopes of the lines of best fit for both data sets are indeed equal. This means that for both sets of points, the y-values increase by 2 units for every 1 unit increase in the x-values, indicating a consistent linear relationship in both data sets.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  HDiv \u2115 \u2115 Float\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nsimp made no progress\ninvalid universe level, 0 is not greater than 0\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: invalid field 'natAbs', the environment does not contain 'Nat.natAbs'\n  numerator\nhas type\n  \u2115\ninvalid field 'natAbs', the environment does not contain 'Nat.natAbs'\n  denominator\nhas type\n  \u2115\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: invalid field 'natAbs', the environment does not contain 'Nat.natAbs'\n  numerator\nhas type\n  \u2115\ninvalid field 'natAbs', the environment does not contain 'Nat.natAbs'\n  denominator\nhas type\n  \u2115\nsimp made no progress\ninvalid universe level, 0 is not greater than 0\nPlease revise the proof.",

We want to subtract 1/2 from this. To do this subtraction, we need to have a common denominator for both fractions. The denominators here are 4 and 2. The least common denominator between 4 and 2 is 4. \n\nSo, we convert 1/2 to a fraction with a denominator of 4. To do this, we multiply both the numerator and the denominator of 1/2 by 2, giving us 2/4. Now, we can subtract:\n\n3/4 - 2/4 = (3 - 2)/4 = 1/4.\n\nAfter this subtraction, we have 1/4. The next step is to add 1/2 back to this result. Again, we need a common denominator to perform the addition. We already know that 1/2 is equivalent to 2/4. So, we add:\n\n1/4 + 2/4 = (1 + 2)/4 = 3/4.\n\nAfter adding 2/4 to 1/4, we end up with 3/4, which is exactly the fraction we started with.\n\nThe reason this works is because subtraction and addition are inverse operations. When you subtract a number and then add the same number back, you effectively undo the subtraction, returning to your original value. In this case, subtracting 1/2 and then adding 1/2 cancels out the effect of the subtraction, leaving us with the original fraction, 3/4.",

This equation states that the number \\( a \\) raised to the power of \\( x \\) is equal to the same number \\( a \\) raised to the power of \\( y \\). For this to be true, the exponents \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) must be the same, provided that the base \\( a \\) is not zero.\n\nWhy is this the case? Let's explore:\n\n1. **Exponentiation is a One-to-One Function for Positive Bases**: When \\( a \\) is a positive number (and not zero), the function \\( f(x) = a^x \\) is one-to-one. This means that if \\( f(x_1) = f(x_2) \\), then \\( x_1 = x_2 \\). In simpler terms, if two outputs of the function are the same, the inputs must also be the same. This property holds because the exponential function is strictly increasing for \\( a > 1 \\) and strictly decreasing for \\( 0 < a < 1 \\).\n\n2. **Using Logarithms**: Another way to see this is by using logarithms. If \\( a^x = a^y \\), we can take the logarithm of both sides of the equation. Using the property of logarithms that states \\( \\log_b(b^c) = c \\), we have:\n   \\[\n   \\log_a(a^x) = \\log_a(a^y)\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   x = y\n   \\]\n   because the logarithm function is the inverse of the exponential function, and it preserves equality.\n\n3. **Why \\( a \\neq 0 \\) is Important**: If \\( a = 0 \\), the expression \\( a^x \\) becomes \\( 0^x \\), which is not well-defined for non-positive \\( x \\) and does not behave like a typical exponential function. Therefore, the condition \\( a \\neq 0 \\) ensures that the exponential function behaves predictably and the properties we rely on (like being one-to-one) hold true.\n\nIn conclusion, the equation \\( a^x = a^y \\) implies \\( x = y \\) because the exponential function with a non-zero base is one-to-one, meaning it maps each input to a unique output. Thus, if two outputs are equal, the inputs must also be equal.\nPrevious attempt failed with: ambiguous, possible interpretations \n  a.log : \u2115 \u2192 \u2115\n  \n  a.log : \u211d\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: typeclass instance problem is stuck, it is often due to metavariables\n  CharZero ?m.128\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown tactic\nPlease revise the proof.",

It states that the rate of change of the function \\(y\\) with respect to \\(x\\) is proportional to the value of \\(y\\) itself. The constant of proportionality is \\(k\\).\n\nNow, let's think about functions whose derivatives are proportional to themselves. A classic example of such a function is the exponential function. Specifically, the derivative of \\(e^{kx}\\) with respect to \\(x\\) is \\(ke^{kx}\\). Notice how the derivative is exactly \\(k\\) times the original function \\(e^{kx}\\). This matches the form of our differential equation.\n\nTo see why \\(y = Ce^{kx}\\) is a solution, let's substitute it into the differential equation. If \\(y = Ce^{kx}\\), then the derivative \\(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\) is calculated as follows:\n\n1. Differentiate \\(y = Ce^{kx}\\) with respect to \\(x\\).

The goal is to find the equation of the tangent line to this curve at any point \\((t, f(t))\\).\n\nFirst, let's recall what a tangent line is. For a curve defined by a function, the tangent line at a point is a straight line that just \"touches\" the curve at that point and has the same slope as the curve does at that point.

Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, identify the key components of the problem. We have a set of assumptions or premises, and we need to derive a conclusion from these. The assumptions might involve properties of numbers, sets, functions, or other mathematical objects, and the conclusion is typically a statement that follows logically from these assumptions.\n\nNext, consider each assumption and how it contributes to the overall argument. For example, if we have an assumption about a function being continuous, we might use this to argue about the behavior of the function at certain points or over certain intervals. Similarly, if we have an assumption about a number being positive, we might use this to infer something about its square or its reciprocal.\n\nOnce we understand the role of each assumption, we can start to build the argument. This often involves combining assumptions in creative ways, using known theorems or properties, and making logical deductions. For instance, if we know that a function is continuous and differentiable, we might use the Mean Value Theorem to make a specific claim about the function's derivative.\n\nAs we build the argument, it's important to keep track of each step and ensure that it follows logically from the previous ones. This might involve checking that certain conditions are met, such as ensuring that a function is defined on a particular interval or that a number is within a certain range.\n\nFinally, once we have constructed a logical chain of reasoning from the assumptions to the conclusion, we can write out the informal proof. This should clearly explain each step of the argument, using natural language to describe the mathematical reasoning. The goal is to make the proof as clear and understandable as possible, so that someone reading it can easily follow the logic and see why the conclusion is true.\n\nIn summary, the informal proof involves understanding the assumptions, building a logical argument using these assumptions, and clearly explaining each step of the reasoning process to show why the conclusion follows from the premises.",

Two events A and B are independent if the occurrence of one does not affect the probability of the occurrence of the other. Mathematically, this is expressed as \\( P(A \\cap B) = P(A) \\times P(B) \\). This means that the probability of both A and B happening together is simply the product of their individual probabilities.\n\nNow, let's consider the union of A and B, denoted as \\( A \\cup B \\). The union represents the event that either A occurs, B occurs, or both occur. To find the probability of this union, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. This principle helps us avoid double-counting the scenarios where both A and B occur.\n\nAccording to the principle of inclusion-exclusion, the probability of the union of two events is given by:\n\\[ P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\cap B) \\]\n\nHere's why this formula makes sense: \n- \\( P(A) \\) accounts for all the outcomes where A occurs.\n- \\( P(B) \\) accounts for all the outcomes where B occurs.\n- However, if we simply added \\( P(A) \\) and \\( P(B) \\), we would be counting the outcomes where both A and B occur twice (once in \\( P(A) \\) and once in \\( P(B) \\)). \n\nTo correct this double-counting, we subtract \\( P(A \\cap B) \\), which is the probability of both A and B occurring. \n\nSince A and B are independent, we know that \\( P(A \\cap B) = P(A) \\times P(B) \\). Substituting this into our formula gives us:\n\\[ P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A) \\times P(B) \\]\n\nThis formula effectively accounts for all possible outcomes in the union of A and B without any double-counting, thanks to the subtraction of the intersection probability. Thus, we have shown that for independent events A and B, the probability of their union is indeed the sum of their individual probabilities minus the product of their probabilities.\nPrevious attempt failed with: function expected at\n  Independent\nterm has type\n  ?m.14\nfunction expected at\n  P\nterm has type\n  ?m.28\nfunction expected at\n  P\nterm has type\n  ?m.28\nfunction expected at\n  P\nterm has type\n  ?m.28\nfunction expected at\n  P\nterm has type\n  ?m.28\ninvalid field notation, type is not of the form (C ...) where C is a constant\n  Independent\nhas type\n  x\u271d\u00b9\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, equality or iff proof expected\n  ?m.3689\n\u03a9 : Type u_1\nx\u271d\u00b9 : Sort u_2\nIndependent : x\u271d\u00b9\nx\u271d : Sort u_3\nP : x\u271d\nA B : Set \u03a9\nh_ind : sorryAx (Sort u_4) true\n\u22a2 sorryAx (?m.3671 A B h_ind) true =\n    sorryAx (?m.3675 A B h_ind) true + sorryAx (?m.3676 A B h_ind) true - sorryAx (?m.3673 A B h_ind) true\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown namespace 'MeasureTheory'\nunexpected token '*'; expected '}'\nexpected token\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown namespace 'MeasureTheory'\nunexpected token '*'; expected '}'\nexpected token\nPlease revise the proof.",

This is done by multiplying $100 by 0.20, which gives us $20.\n   - We subtract this discount from the original price: $100 - $20 = $80.\n   - So, after the first discount, the price of the toy car is $80.\n\n2. **Second Discount with the Coupon:**\n   - John has a coupon that offers an additional 10% discount on the already discounted price of $80.\n   - To find this additional discount, we calculate 10% of $80. This is done by multiplying $80 by 0.10, which results in $8.\n   - We then subtract this $8 from the $80 price: $80 - $8 = $72.\n\nTherefore, after applying both the store discount and the coupon, the final price John has to pay for the toy car is $72.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

A real root of the polynomial would mean that the graph of \\( f(x) \\) intersects the x-axis at that point.\n\nOne approach to investigate the presence of real roots is to analyze the behavior of the polynomial and its derivative. Let's start by considering the end behavior of the polynomial. Since the leading term is \\( 2x^4 \\), which is a positive coefficient of an even power, as \\( x \\) approaches positive or negative infinity, \\( f(x) \\) will tend to positive infinity. This suggests that the graph of the polynomial will rise on both ends.\n\nNext, let's consider the derivative of the polynomial, \\( f'(x) \\), to understand the critical points and the nature of the graph between these points. The derivative is:\n\n\\[ f'(x) = 8x^3 - 9x^2 - 22x + 6. \\]\n\nFinding the critical points involves solving \\( f'(x) = 0 \\). However, solving this cubic equation exactly can be complex, so instead, we can use the derivative to analyze the general shape of the graph. The sign of \\( f'(x) \\) will tell us where the function is increasing or decreasing.\n\nNow, let's evaluate \\( f(x) \\) at some strategic points to get a sense of its values:\n\n1. At \\( x = 0 \\), \\( f(0) = 30 \\).\n2. At \\( x = 1 \\), \\( f(1) = 2(1)^4 - 3(1)^3 - 11(1)^2 + 6(1) + 30 = 2 - 3 - 11 + 6 + 30 = 24 \\).\n3. At \\( x = -1 \\), \\( f(-1) = 2(-1)^4 - 3(-1)^3 - 11(-1)^2 + 6(-1) + 30 = 2 + 3 - 11 - 6 + 30 = 18 \\).\n\nThese evaluations show that \\( f(x) \\) is positive at these points. Since the polynomial is continuous and the end behavior indicates that it goes to positive infinity as \\( x \\) approaches both positive and negative infinity, the graph does not cross the x-axis. \n\nAdditionally, if we consider the possibility of complex roots, the polynomial could have complex conjugate pairs, which do not affect the real axis intersections. The fact that \\( f(x) \\) remains positive at several points and the end behavior suggests that the polynomial does not dip below the x-axis, further supporting the absence of real roots.\n\nTherefore, based on the end behavior, the derivative analysis, and the evaluations at specific points, we can conclude that the polynomial \\( f(x) = 2x^4 - 3x^3 - 11x^2 + 6x + 30 \\) has no real roots.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

Write down 1 and carry over 1 to the tens place.\n- Next, add the tens digits: 4 (from 345) + 5 (from 456) = 9, and add the carried over 1, which gives us 10. Write down 0 and carry over 1 to the hundreds place.\n- Finally, add the hundreds digits: 3 (from 345) + 4 (from 456) = 7, and add the carried over 1, which gives us 8.\n\nSo, 345 + 456 = 801.\n\nNow, we need to subtract the third number, 199, from this sum:\n\n- Start by subtracting the units digits: 1 (from 801) - 9 (from 199). Since 1 is less than 9, we need to borrow 1 from the tens place. This makes the units digit 11, and the tens digit becomes 9 (since we borrowed 1 from it).\n- Now, 11 - 9 = 2.\n- Next, subtract the tens digits: 9 (from 801, after borrowing) - 9 (from 199) = 0.\n- Finally, subtract the hundreds digits: 8 (from 801) - 1 (from 199) = 7.\n\nSo, 801 - 199 = 602.\n\nNow, we compare the result, 602, with 600.

This means that to convert milliliters to liters, we divide the number of milliliters by 1000.\n\nNow, let's divide the 1000 milliliters of juice equally into 4 cups.

The expected value, E[f(X)], is essentially the average value of f(X) when considering all possible outcomes of the die roll, each weighted by its probability.\n\nFirst, let's calculate E[f(X)]. Since the die is fair, each outcome (1 through 6) has an equal probability of 1/6. The expected value of f(X) is calculated by summing the products of each possible value of f(X) and its probability:\n\n1.

The derivative of f(x) = x\u00b2 is f'(x) = 2x.

The solution to this system can be expressed in terms of a matrix exponential. Specifically, if X(t) is the matrix whose columns are solutions to this system, then X(t) can be written as e^(At), where e^(At) is the matrix exponential of At.\n\nThe matrix exponential e^(At) is defined as the infinite series:\n\ne^(At) = I + At + (A^2t^2)/2! + (A^3t^3)/3! + ...\n\nNow, let's consider the Laplace Transform of X(t). The Laplace Transform of a function f(t) is given by the integral from 0 to infinity of e^(-st)f(t) dt, where s is a complex number. Applying this to the matrix X(t) = e^(At), we need to compute the Laplace Transform of e^(At).\n\nThe Laplace Transform of e^(At) is computed term by term from the series expansion:\n\nL{e^(At)} = L{I} + L{At} + L{(A^2t^2)/2!} + ...\n\nFor each term, the Laplace Transform can be computed using the property that L{t^n} = n!/s^(n+1). Applying this to each term, we get:\n\n- L{I} = 1/s * I (since the Laplace Transform of a constant is 1/s times the constant)\n- L{At} = A/s^2\n- L{(A^2t^2)/2!} = A^2/s^3\n- ...\n\nContinuing this process, we see that the Laplace Transform of e^(At) is:\n\nL{e^(At)} = (1/s)I + (1/s^2)A + (1/s^3)A^2 + ...\n\nThis series is a geometric series in terms of the matrix A/s. The sum of an infinite geometric series a + ar + ar^2 + ... is given by a/(1-r), provided |r| < 1.

According to the Central Limit Theorem, if \\( n \\) is sufficiently large, the distribution of \\( \\bar{X} \\) is approximately normal, regardless of the shape of the population distribution. This normal distribution of \\( \\bar{X} \\) has a mean \\( \\mu \\) and a standard deviation \\( \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} \\).\n\nThe probability density function of a normal distribution is symmetric about its mean. This symmetry implies that the highest point of the pdf, which is the peak, occurs at the mean \\( \\mu \\). At this peak, the slope of the pdf is zero because the curve is neither increasing nor decreasing at this point; it is at a maximum.\n\nNow, the derivative of a function at a point gives us the slope of the tangent to the function at that point. For the pdf of \\( \\bar{X} \\), the derivative with respect to \\( \\bar{X} \\) at \\( \\bar{X} = \\mu \\) represents the slope of the pdf at the mean. Since the pdf is at its peak at \\( \\mu \\), the slope is zero. Therefore, the derivative of the pdf of \\( \\bar{X} \\) with respect to \\( \\bar{X} \\) is zero when \\( \\bar{X} = \\mu \\).\n\nIn summary, the symmetry of the normal distribution about its mean ensures that the pdf reaches its maximum at the mean, and thus the derivative, which indicates the slope, is zero at this point. This is why the derivative of the pdf of the sample mean \\( \\bar{X} \\) is zero when \\( \\bar{X} \\) equals the population mean \\( \\mu \\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: expected token\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: expected token\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: expected token\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nInitially, the team consists of 15 players. However, with one player injured, only 14 players are available for selection. The task is to choose 11 players from these 14 available players.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 11 players from 14 is given by the combination formula, which is denoted as \"14 choose 11\" or mathematically as C(14, 11). The combination formula is:\n\n\\[ C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the total number of items to choose from, \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose, and \\( ! \\) denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.\n\nApplying this formula to our problem:\n\n\\[ C(14, 11) = \\frac{14!}{11! \\times (14-11)!} = \\frac{14!}{11! \\times 3!} \\]\n\nCalculating the factorials, we have:\n\n- \\( 14! = 14 \\times 13 \\times 12 \\times 11! \\)\n- \\( 3! = 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 6 \\)\n\nSubstituting these into the combination formula, we get:\n\n\\[ C(14, 11) = \\frac{14 \\times 13 \\times 12 \\times 11!}{11! \\times 6} \\]\n\nThe \\( 11! \\) in the numerator and denominator cancel out, leaving:\n\n\\[ C(14, 11) = \\frac{14 \\times 13 \\times 12}{6} \\]\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\n\\[ 14 \\times 13 = 182 \\]\n\\[ 182 \\times 12 = 2184 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{2184}{6} = 364 \\]\n\nSo, there are 364 different ways to choose 11 players from the 14 available players.\n\nNext, we consider the second part of the problem: the coach changes the players every 10 minutes during a 90-minute game. This means the coach can make changes at the following times: 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, and 90 minutes. This results in 10 different time points.\n\nThe rate of change of the number of different teams the coach can choose is 0 when the number of ways to choose the team does not change. Since the number of ways to choose 11 players from 14 remains constant at 364 throughout the game, the rate of change is always 0.\n\nTherefore, the rate of change of the number of different teams the coach can choose is 0 at all 10 time points. Thus, the rate of change is 0 a total of 10 times during the game.\nPrevious attempt failed with: ambiguous, possible interpretations \n  _root_.factorial n : \u2115\n  \n  n ! : \u2115\nambiguous, possible interpretations \n  _root_.factorial k : \u2115\n  \n  k ! : \u2115\nambiguous, possible interpretations \n  _root_.factorial (n - k) : \u2115\n  \n  (n - k)! : \u2115\ntype of theorem 'number_of_ways_to_choose_players' is not a proposition\n  \u2115\nunknown identifier 'number_of_ways_to_choose_players'\ntype of theorem 'rate_of_change_is_zero' is not a proposition\n  \u2115\nunknown identifier 'rate_of_change_is_zero'\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: ambiguous, possible interpretations \n  _root_.factorial n : \u2115\n  \n  n ! : \u2115\nambiguous, possible interpretations \n  _root_.factorial k : \u2115\n  \n  k ! : \u2115\nambiguous, possible interpretations \n  _root_.factorial (n - k) : \u2115\n  \n  (n - k)! : \u2115\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: ambiguous, possible interpretations \n  _root_.factorial n : \u2115\n  \n  n ! : \u2115\nambiguous, possible interpretations \n  _root_.factorial k : \u2115\n  \n  k ! : \u2115\nambiguous, possible interpretations \n  _root_.factorial (n - k) : \u2115\n  \n  (n - k)! : \u2115\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

The Law of Cosines states that for any triangle with sides a, b, and c opposite to angles A, B, and C respectively, the following holds:\n\n\\[ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \\cdot \\cos(C) \\]\n\nIn our triangle, let's assign:\n- a = 7 (BC)\n- b = 8 (AC)\n- c = 5 (AB)\n\nWe want to find cos(A), so we rearrange the formula to solve for cos(A):\n\n\\[ a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \\cdot \\cos(A) \\]\n\nSubstitute the known values:\n\n\\[ 7^2 = 8^2 + 5^2 - 2 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 5 \\cdot \\cos(A) \\]\n\nCalculate the squares:\n\n\\[ 49 = 64 + 25 - 80 \\cdot \\cos(A) \\]\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n\\[ 49 = 89 - 80 \\cdot \\cos(A) \\]\n\nRearrange to solve for cos(A):\n\n\\[ 80 \\cdot \\cos(A) = 89 - 49 \\]\n\n\\[ 80 \\cdot \\cos(A) = 40 \\]\n\n\\[ \\cos(A) = \\frac{40}{80} = \\frac{1}{2} \\]\n\nNow that we have cos(A) = 1/2, we can use the Pythagorean identity to find sin(A).

The area we are interested in is the region bounded by the curve \\( y = f(x) \\), the x-axis, and the vertical lines \\( x = a \\) and \\( x = b \\).\n\nThe idea of using an integral to find this area comes from approximating the area using simpler shapes, like rectangles, and then refining this approximation. This method is known as the Riemann sum approach.\n\n1. **Approximation with Rectangles:**\n   - Divide the interval \\([a, b]\\) into \\( n \\) smaller subintervals of equal width \\(\\Delta x = \\frac{b-a}{n}\\).\n   - For each subinterval, choose a sample point \\( x_i^* \\) (this could be the left endpoint, right endpoint, or any point within the subinterval).\n   - Construct a rectangle for each subinterval where the height of the rectangle is \\( f(x_i^*) \\) and the width is \\(\\Delta x\\).\n   - The area of each rectangle is approximately \\( f(x_i^*) \\Delta x \\).\n\n2. **Summing the Areas:**\n   - Add up the areas of all these rectangles to get an approximation of the total area under the curve: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Approximate Area} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i^*) \\Delta x\n     \\]\n\n3. **Refining the Approximation:**\n   - As you increase the number of rectangles (i.e., let \\( n \\) approach infinity), the width of each rectangle \\(\\Delta x\\) becomes very small.\n   - The sum of the areas of these increasingly narrow rectangles becomes a better approximation of the actual area under the curve.\n\n4. **Taking the Limit:**\n   - The process of taking the limit as \\( n \\) approaches infinity is precisely what the definite integral does. It sums up the areas of infinitely many infinitesimally thin rectangles.\n   - Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n     \\[\n     \\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i^*) \\Delta x\n     \\]\n\n5. **Continuity and the Integral:**\n   - The continuity of \\( f \\) on \\([a, b]\\) ensures that the function does not have any jumps or breaks, which means the Riemann sum will converge to a single value as \\( n \\) increases.\n   - This convergence is what allows us to say that the definite integral \\(\\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx\\) accurately represents the area under the curve.\n\nIn summary, the definite integral from \\( a \\) to \\( b \\) of a continuous function \\( f(x) \\) is the limit of the sum of the areas of rectangles that approximate the area under the curve. This integral gives us the exact area because it accounts for every point on the curve, thanks to the continuity of \\( f \\). Thus, the area \\( A \\) under the curve from \\( a \\) to \\( b \\) is indeed given by \\(\\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx\\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: function expected at\n  Icc\nterm has type\n  ?m.378\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: function expected at\n  Icc\nterm has type\n  ?m.166\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: function expected at\n  Icc\nterm has type\n  ?m.166\nunknown identifier 'begin'\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

This means that triangle ABC is a right triangle with angle BAC as the right angle. In a right triangle, the side opposite the right angle is called the hypotenuse, and the other two sides are called the legs.\n\nHere, we are given the lengths of the two legs of the triangle: AB is 6 units long, and BC is 8 units long. We need to find the length of the hypotenuse, which is side AC.\n\nTo find the length of the hypotenuse in a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (a and b).

The presence of \\( t \\) does not affect this relationship, as the statement holds for any real number \\( t \\) without any additional conditions or modifications. \n\nIn summary, the equality \\( E((X - \\mu)^2) = \\sigma^2 \\) is a direct consequence of how variance is defined in probability theory.\nPrevious attempt failed with: invalid binder annotation, type is not a class instance\n  ?m.10\nuse the command `set_option checkBinderAnnotations false` to disable the check\nunexpected token '('; expected ':=', 'where' or '|'\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to prove index is valid, possible solutions:\n  - Use `have`-expressions to prove the index is valid\n  - Use `a[i]!` notation instead, runtime check is perfomed, and 'Panic' error message is produced if index is not valid\n  - Use `a[i]?` notation instead, result is an `Option` type\n  - Use `a[i]'h` notation instead, where `h` is a proof that index is valid\nVar : ?m.23\nE : ?m.218\nX : Type ?u.221\ninst\u271d : MeasurableSpace X\n\u03bc \u03c3 : \u211d\nh_var : Var[X] = \u03c3 ^ 2\nt : \u211d\n\u22a2 ?m.785 t E fun x => (x - \u03bc) ^ 2\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, motive is not type correct\ncoll\u271d\u00b9 : Type u_1\nVar : coll\u271d\u00b9\ncoll\u271d : Type u_2\nE : coll\u271d\nX : Type u_3\ninst\u271d : MeasurableSpace X\n\u03bc \u03c3 : \u211d\nh_var : Var[X] = \u03c3 ^ 2\nt : \u211d\n\u22a2 E[fun x => (x - \u03bc) ^ 2] = \u03c3 ^ 2\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: invalid binder annotation, type is not a class instance\n  ?m.26\nuse the command `set_option checkBinderAnnotations false` to disable the check\nPlease revise the proof.",

Similar triangles have the same shape but not necessarily the same size. This means that their corresponding angles are equal, and their corresponding sides are in proportion. In our case, triangles ABC and DEF are similar, and we are given that the ratio of their corresponding sides is k. Specifically, this means:\n\n- AB/DE = k\n- BC/EF = k\n- AC/DF = k\n\nNow, let's consider the areas of these triangles. The area of a triangle is generally given by the formula: \n\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} \\]\n\nFor similar triangles, not only are the sides in proportion, but the heights corresponding to these sides are also in the same proportion. This is because the height is essentially a perpendicular line segment from a vertex to the opposite side, and since the triangles are similar, all linear dimensions scale by the same factor.\n\nLet's say the height corresponding to side AB in triangle ABC is h1, and the height corresponding to side DE in triangle DEF is h2. Since the triangles are similar, the ratio of these heights will also be k:\n\n\\[ h1/h2 = k \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the areas of the triangles using the base-height formula:\n\n- The area of triangle ABC, S1, can be expressed as:\n  \\[ S1 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times AB \\times h1 \\]\n\n- The area of triangle DEF, S2, can be expressed as:\n  \\[ S2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times DE \\times h2 \\]\n\nSubstitute the proportional relationships into these area formulas:\n\n- Since AB = k \\times DE, we can write:\n  \\[ S1 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (k \\times DE) \\times (k \\times h2) \\]\n\n- Simplifying this, we get:\n  \\[ S1 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times k^2 \\times DE \\times h2 \\]\n\n- Notice that \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times DE \\times h2\\) is exactly S2, the area of triangle DEF. So:\n  \\[ S1 = k^2 \\times S2 \\]\n\nFinally, rearranging this equation gives us the desired result:\n\\[ \\frac{S1}{S2} = k^2 \\]\n\nThus, the ratio of the areas of two similar triangles is indeed the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. This is because both the base and the height of the triangles scale by the same factor, leading to the area scaling by the square of that factor.\nPrevious attempt failed with: simp made no progress\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: simp made no progress\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: simp made no progress\nPlease revise the proof.",

The parameterization \\( r(t) = \\langle \\cos(t), \\sin(t), t \\rangle \\) describes a helix that wraps around the z-axis. As \\( t \\) goes from 0 to \\( 2\\pi \\), the x and y components trace out a circle in the xy-plane, while the z component increases linearly from 0 to \\( 2\\pi \\).\n\nNext, we need to compute the line integral \\( \\int_C F \\cdot dr \\).

The vector field \\( F = \\langle y, -x, z \\rangle \\) is actually the curl of another vector field, which makes it conservative. Therefore, the line integral over a closed path in a conservative field is zero.\n\nThus, the line integral over the curve \\( C \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\int_C F \\cdot dr = 0\n\\]\n\nThis confirms that the line integral of the vector field \\( F \\) over the helix \\( C \\) is indeed zero.\nPrevious attempt failed with: compiler IR check failed at 'r', error: unknown declaration 'Real.cos'\ncompiler IR check failed at 'r'', error: unknown declaration 'Real.sin'\ncompiler IR check failed at 'dot_product', error: unknown declaration 'r'\ninvalid projection, structure has only 1 field(s)\n  0.\nhas type\n  Float\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: compiler IR check failed at 'r', error: unknown declaration 'Real.cos'\ncompiler IR check failed at 'r'', error: unknown declaration 'Real.sin'\nunexpected token '('; expected '_', 'rec', '{', identifier or tactic\napplication type mismatch\n  F (r t).1 (r t).2\nargument\n  (r t).2\nhas type\n  \u211d \u00d7 \u211d : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u211d : Type\ninvalid projection, structure has only 2 field(s)\n  r t\nhas type\n  \u211d \u00d7 \u211d \u00d7 \u211d\ninvalid projection, structure has only 1 field(s)\n  0.\nhas type\n  Float\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: compiler IR check failed at 'r', error: unknown declaration 'Real.cos'\ncompiler IR check failed at 'r'', error: unknown declaration 'Real.sin'\ncompiler IR check failed at 'integrand', error: unknown declaration 'r'\ninvalid projection, structure has only 1 field(s)\n  0.\nhas type\n  Float\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

The unit circle is a circle with a radius of 1 centered at the origin of a coordinate plane. Any point on this circle can be described using an angle \\(x\\), measured from the positive x-axis. The coordinates of this point are \\((\\cos x, \\sin x)\\).\n\nNow, because the point \\((\\cos x, \\sin x)\\) lies on the unit circle, it must satisfy the equation of the circle, which is derived from the Pythagorean theorem. The equation for a circle with radius 1 centered at the origin is:\n\n\\[\nx^2 + y^2 = 1\n\\]\n\nIn our case, since the point is \\((\\cos x, \\sin x)\\), we substitute \\(x\\) with \\(\\cos x\\) and \\(y\\) with \\(\\sin x\\). This gives us:\n\n\\[\n(\\cos x)^2 + (\\sin x)^2 = 1\n\\]\n\nThis is exactly the equation \\(\\cos^2 x + \\sin^2 x = 1\\), which is what we wanted to prove.\n\nThe reason this identity holds for all real numbers \\(x\\) is that the trigonometric functions \\(\\sin x\\) and \\(\\cos x\\) are periodic and continuous, meaning they repeat their values in a regular pattern and are defined for all real numbers. No matter what real number \\(x\\) you choose, the point \\((\\cos x, \\sin x)\\) will always lie on the unit circle, thus satisfying the equation of the circle.\n\nIn summary, the identity \\(\\sin^2 x + \\cos^2 x = 1\\) is a direct consequence of the definition of sine and cosine in terms of the unit circle and the Pythagorean theorem.

We have a vector space \\( V \\) with a basis \\( B = \\{v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_n\\} \\). This means any vector in \\( V \\) can be expressed as a linear combination of these basis vectors. We also have a differentiable function \\( f: V \\to \\mathbb{R} \\), which means \\( f \\) is smooth enough to have derivatives in all directions.\n\nThe directional derivative of \\( f \\) at a point \\( a \\) in the direction of a vector \\( v_i \\) is a measure of how \\( f \\) changes as we move from \\( a \\) in the direction of \\( v_i \\). Mathematically, it's given by the dot product of the gradient of \\( f \\) at \\( a \\) with the vector \\( v_i \\).\n\nNow, the problem states that for each basis vector \\( v_i \\), the directional derivative of \\( f \\) at \\( a \\) in the direction of \\( v_i \\) is equal to the \\( i \\)-th component of a vector \\( w \\). This means that if we denote the gradient of \\( f \\) at \\( a \\) by \\( \\nabla f(a) \\), then:\n\n\\[ \\nabla f(a) \\cdot v_i = w_i \\]\n\nfor each \\( i \\), where \\( w_i \\) is the \\( i \\)-th component of the vector \\( w \\).\n\nThe gradient \\( \\nabla f(a) \\) is a vector that points in the direction of the greatest rate of increase of the function \\( f \\) and its components are the partial derivatives of \\( f \\) with respect to the coordinates defined by the basis \\( B \\).\n\nSince the directional derivative in the direction of each basis vector \\( v_i \\) is given by the dot product \\( \\nabla f(a) \\cdot v_i \\), and we know this equals \\( w_i \\), it implies that the components of the gradient vector \\( \\nabla f(a) \\) in the basis \\( B \\) are exactly the components of the vector \\( w \\).\n\nTherefore, the gradient of \\( f \\) at the point \\( a \\) is precisely the vector \\( w \\). This is because the gradient vector is uniquely determined by its components in the basis \\( B \\), and these components are given by the directional derivatives, which match the components of \\( w \\).\n\nIn summary, the condition that the directional derivatives match the components of \\( w \\) directly tells us that the gradient of \\( f \\) at \\( a \\) is \\( w \\). Thus, we have shown that the gradient of \\( f \\) at \\( a \\) is equal to the vector \\( w \\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: expected token\nexpected token\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: expected token\nexpected token\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  NormedAddCommGroup V\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nexpected ';' or line break\nexpected token\nPlease revise the proof.",

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, we are given three 4-digit numbers: 1234, 5678, and 3456. The task is to add the first two numbers, 1234 and 5678, and then subtract the third number, 3456, from the result of that addition.\n\n1. **Addition of the first two numbers:**\n   - Start by adding 1234 and 5678. \n   - We can do this by adding each digit starting from the rightmost digit (units place) to the leftmost digit (thousands place).\n   - Units place: 4 + 8 = 12. Write down 2 and carry over 1 to the tens place.\n   - Tens place: 3 + 7 = 10, plus the carry-over 1 makes 11. Write down 1 and carry over 1 to the hundreds place.\n   - Hundreds place: 2 + 6 = 8, plus the carry-over 1 makes 9. Write down 9.\n   - Thousands place: 1 + 5 = 6. Write down 6.\n   - So, the sum of 1234 and 5678 is 6912.\n\n2. **Subtraction of the third number:**\n   - Now, we need to subtract the third number, 3456, from the sum we just calculated, which is 6912.\n   - Again, we perform this subtraction starting from the rightmost digit.\n   - Units place: 2 - 6. Since 2 is less than 6, we need to borrow 1 from the tens place, making it 12 - 6 = 6.\n   - Tens place: After borrowing, we have 0 (since we borrowed 1 from 1). So, 0 - 5 requires borrowing from the hundreds place. Borrow 1, making it 10 - 5 = 5.\n   - Hundreds place: After borrowing, we have 8 (since we borrowed 1 from 9). So, 8 - 4 = 4.\n   - Thousands place: 6 - 3 = 3.\n   - Therefore, the result of subtracting 3456 from 6912 is 3456.\n\nThus, after performing the addition and subtraction as described, the final result is 3456.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unsolved goals\nsum_first_two : add_first_two = 6912\n\u22a2 6912 - num3 = 6912 - 3456\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unsolved goals\nsum_first_two : add_first_two = 6912\n\u22a2 6912 - num3 = 6912 - 3456\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unsolved goals\nh1 : add_first_two = 6912\n\u22a2 6912 - num3 = 6912 - 3456\nPlease revise the proof.",

A rational number is any number that can be expressed as the quotient of two integers, where the denominator is not zero. So, we can write \\( a \\) as \\( \\frac{m}{n} \\) and \\( b \\) as \\( \\frac{p}{q} \\), where \\( m, n, p, \\) and \\( q \\) are integers, and \\( n \\) and \\( q \\) are not zero.\n\nGiven that \\( a \\times b = 1 \\), we substitute the expressions for \\( a \\) and \\( b \\):\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{m}{n}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{p}{q}\\right) = 1\n\\]\n\nWhen we multiply these two fractions, we multiply the numerators together and the denominators together:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{m \\times p}{n \\times q} = 1\n\\]\n\nFor this fraction to equal 1, the numerator must equal the denominator.

        "informal_proof": "# Informal Proof:\nTo understand why the length of side AB is equal to the length of side DE, we need to consider what it means for two triangles to be congruent and how transformations affect the properties of geometric figures.\n\nFirst, let's recall that two triangles are congruent if they have the same size and shape. This means that all corresponding sides and angles of the two triangles are equal. In our case, triangles ABC and DEF are congruent, so by definition, the corresponding sides of these triangles must be equal in length. Therefore, side AB in triangle ABC must be equal in length to side DE in triangle DEF.\n\nNow, let's consider the transformations mentioned: rotation, reflection, and translation. These are known as rigid transformations or isometries. The key property of rigid transformations is that they preserve distances and angles. This means that when a shape is transformed using any combination of these transformations, the size and shape of the figure do not change.\n\n1. **Rotation**: When a triangle is rotated, it is turned around a point by a certain angle. This does not change the lengths of the sides or the measures of the angles. So, if triangle ABC is rotated to become triangle DEF, the length of side AB remains the same as the length of side DE.\n\n2. **Reflection**: Reflecting a triangle over a line creates a mirror image of the triangle. While the orientation of the triangle changes, the lengths of the sides and the measures of the angles remain unchanged. Thus, if triangle ABC is reflected to become triangle DEF, the length of side AB is still equal to the length of side DE.\n\n3. **Translation**: Translating a triangle involves sliding it in a straight line from one position to another. This movement does not alter the size or shape of the triangle, so the lengths of the sides remain the same. Therefore, if triangle ABC is translated to become triangle DEF, the length of side AB continues to be equal to the length of side DE.\n\nSince any combination of these transformations will not change the lengths of the sides of a triangle, and given that triangles ABC and DEF are congruent, we can confidently conclude that the length of side AB is equal to the length of side DE. This is because congruence and rigid transformations both ensure that corresponding sides of the triangles remain equal in length.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  CategoryTheory.Category.{?u.11, ?u.10} Triangle\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\ninvalid field notation, type is not of the form (C ...) where C is a constant\n  ABC\nhas type\n  Triangle\ninvalid field notation, type is not of the form (C ...) where C is a constant\n  DEF\nhas type\n  Triangle\nfailed to prove index is valid, possible solutions:\n  - Use `have`-expressions to prove the index is valid\n  - Use `a[i]!` notation instead, runtime check is perfomed, and 'Panic' error message is produced if index is not valid\n  - Use `a[i]?` notation instead, result is an `Option` type\n  - Use `a[i]'h` notation instead, where `h` is a proof that index is valid\nTriangle : Type ?u.10\nABC DEF : Triangle\nh_congruent : sorryAx (Type ?u.11) true\n\u22a2 ?m.1373 (sorryAx ?m.1369 true) 0\nfailed to prove index is valid, possible solutions:\n  - Use `have`-expressions to prove the index is valid\n  - Use `a[i]!` notation instead, runtime check is perfomed, and 'Panic' error message is produced if index is not valid\n  - Use `a[i]?` notation instead, result is an `Option` type\n  - Use `a[i]'h` notation instead, where `h` is a proof that index is valid\nTriangle : Type ?u.10\nABC DEF : Triangle\nh_congruent : sorryAx (Type ?u.11) true\nAB : ?m.1620 := (sorryAx ?m.1369 true)[0]\n\u22a2 ?m.1623 (sorryAx ?m.1622 true) 0\ninvalid field notation, type is not of the form (C ...) where C is a constant\n  ABC\nhas type\n  Triangle\ninvalid field notation, type is not of the form (C ...) where C is a constant\n  DEF\nhas type\n  Triangle\nfailed to prove index is valid, possible solutions:\n  - Use `have`-expressions to prove the index is valid\n  - Use `a[i]!` notation instead, runtime check is perfomed, and 'Panic' error message is produced if index is not valid\n  - Use `a[i]?` notation instead, result is an `Option` type\n  - Use `a[i]'h` notation instead, where `h` is a proof that index is valid\nTriangle : Type u_1\nABC DEF : Triangle\nh_congruent : sorryAx (Type u_2) true\ni : ?m.3705\n\u22a2 ?m.3966 i (sorryAx (?m.3965 i) true) i\nfailed to prove index is valid, possible solutions:\n  - Use `have`-expressions to prove the index is valid\n  - Use `a[i]!` notation instead, runtime check is perfomed, and 'Panic' error message is produced if index is not valid\n  - Use `a[i]?` notation instead, result is an `Option` type\n  - Use `a[i]'h` notation instead, where `h` is a proof that index is valid\nTriangle : Type u_1\nABC DEF : Triangle\nh_congruent : sorryAx (Type u_2) true\ni : ?m.3705\n\u22a2 ?m.3970 i (sorryAx (?m.3969 i) true) i\nunsolved goals\nTriangle : Type u_1\nABC DEF : Triangle\nh_congruent : sorryAx (Type u_2) true\n\u22a2 let AB := (sorryAx (?m.3686 ABC DEF h_congruent) true)[0];\n  let DE := (sorryAx (?m.3689 ABC DEF h_congruent) true)[0];\n  AB = DE\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.sqrt', and it does not have executable code\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.sqrt', and it does not have executable code\nPlease revise the proof.",

We can use the properties of the normal distribution to find this probability.\n\nFirst, let's understand the setup. We are given that the sample proportion follows a normal distribution with a mean equal to the population proportion, which is 0.7 in this case. The standard deviation of the sample proportion is calculated using the formula for the standard deviation of a sample proportion, which is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Standard Deviation} = \\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}} \\]\n\nPlugging in the values, we have:\n\n\\[ p = 0.7, \\quad 1-p = 0.3, \\quad n = 100 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Standard Deviation} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.7 \\times 0.3}{100}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.21}{100}} = \\sqrt{0.0021} \\approx 0.0458 \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the z-score for the sample proportion of 0.5. The z-score is a measure of how many standard deviations an element is from the mean. It is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{x - \\text{mean}}{\\text{standard deviation}} \\]\n\nHere, \\( x = 0.5 \\), the mean is 0.7, and the standard deviation is approximately 0.0458. Substituting these values into the formula gives:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{0.5 - 0.7}{0.0458} = \\frac{-0.2}{0.0458} \\approx -4.37 \\]\n\nThe z-score of approximately -4.37 indicates that 0.5 is 4.37 standard deviations below the mean of 0.7. In a standard normal distribution, a z-score of -4.37 is extremely low, meaning that the probability of observing a sample proportion less than 0.5 is very small.\n\nTo find this probability, we can refer to standard normal distribution tables or use statistical software. Typically, a z-score of -4.37 corresponds to a probability that is very close to 0. In practical terms, this means that it is highly unlikely to observe a sample proportion less than 0.5 when the true population proportion is 0.7 and the sample size is 100.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the sample proportion is less than 0.5 is extremely small, almost negligible, given the parameters of this problem.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\nunknown constant 'Real.erf'\ncannot evaluate code because 'prob_less_than_x' uses 'sorry' and/or contains errors\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: expected token\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'z_score', and it does not have executable code\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: expected token\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to synthesize\n  ToString \u211d\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  ToString \u211d\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\ncannot evaluate code because 'main' uses 'sorry' and/or contains errors\nPlease revise the proof.",

Our goal is to isolate \\(x\\) on one side of the equation to find out what that number is.\n\nFirst, let's focus on getting rid of the 5 that is added to \\(2x\\). We can do this by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation. This step is based on the principle that if you do the same thing to both sides of an equation, the equality is maintained. So, we subtract 5 from both sides:\n\n\\[2x + 5 - 5 = 15 - 5\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[2x = 10\\]\n\nNow, we have a simpler equation: \\(2x = 10\\). This tells us that twice the number \\(x\\) equals 10. To find \\(x\\), we need to undo the multiplication by 2. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 2. Again, this is based on the principle that performing the same operation on both sides of an equation keeps it balanced.

This theorem connects the concept of differentiation with that of integration, two of the main operations in calculus.\n\nLet's start by considering what \\( F(x) \\) represents. The function \\( F(x) \\) is defined as the integral of \\( f(t) \\) from some fixed point \\( a \\) to \\( x \\). In mathematical terms, this is written as:\n\n\\[ F(x) = \\int_a^x f(t) \\, dt. \\]\n\nThe goal is to show that the derivative of \\( F(x) \\) with respect to \\( x \\) is \\( f(x) \\).

The value of \\( F(x) \\) changes to \\( F(x + h) \\), which is:\n\n\\[ F(x + h) = \\int_a^{x+h} f(t) \\, dt. \\]\n\nThe change in \\( F(x) \\) as \\( x \\) changes to \\( x + h \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ F(x + h) - F(x) = \\int_a^{x+h} f(t) \\, dt - \\int_a^x f(t) \\, dt. \\]\n\nUsing the properties of definite integrals, this difference simplifies to:\n\n\\[ F(x + h) - F(x) = \\int_x^{x+h} f(t) \\, dt. \\]\n\nNow, to find the derivative of \\( F(x) \\), we consider the limit of the average rate of change as \\( h \\) approaches zero:\n\n\\[ \\frac{F(x + h) - F(x)}{h} = \\frac{1}{h} \\int_x^{x+h} f(t) \\, dt. \\]\n\nAs \\( h \\) becomes very small, the interval \\([x, x+h]\\) also becomes very small. Because \\( f(t) \\) is continuous, on this small interval, \\( f(t) \\) doesn't change much and is approximately constant. Therefore, the integral \\(\\int_x^{x+h} f(t) \\, dt\\) is approximately \\( f(x) \\times h \\), where \\( f(x) \\) is the value of the function at the point \\( x \\).\n\nThus, the expression becomes:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{h} \\int_x^{x+h} f(t) \\, dt \\approx \\frac{1}{h} \\times f(x) \\times h = f(x). \\]\n\nTaking the limit as \\( h \\) approaches zero, the approximation becomes exact due to the continuity of \\( f(t) \\), and we have:\n\n\\[ \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{1}{h} \\int_x^{x+h} f(t) \\, dt = f(x). \\]\n\nTherefore, the derivative of \\( F(x) \\) is indeed \\( f(x) \\), which completes our proof.

We know that these lines are parallel and have a slope of 2, and the distance between them is 10 units. The line EF has a slope of -0.5.\n\nFirst, let's understand the geometric setup. Since AB and CD are parallel, they have the same slope, which is 2. This means that for every unit increase in the x-direction, the y-coordinate increases by 2 units for both lines. The distance between these two parallel lines is given as 10 units, which is the perpendicular distance between them.\n\nNow, consider the line EF, which intersects AB at point E and CD at point F. The slope of EF is -0.5, meaning that for every unit increase in the x-direction, the y-coordinate decreases by 0.5 units. This negative slope indicates that EF is slanting downwards as it moves from left to right.\n\nTo find the length of EF, we need to determine how far apart points E and F are along the line EF. Since the distance between the parallel lines AB and CD is 10 units, and this distance is measured perpendicularly, we can use the concept of the slope to find the horizontal and vertical components of EF.\n\nThe slope of EF is -0.5, which can be interpreted as a rise of -0.5 units for every run of 1 unit. However, since we are dealing with a perpendicular distance of 10 units between the lines, we need to find the actual horizontal distance (run) that corresponds to this vertical change (rise).\n\nTo do this, we use the relationship between the slope and the components of the line. The slope is the ratio of the vertical change to the horizontal change. Here, the vertical change (rise) is the perpendicular distance between the lines, which is 10 units. The slope of -0.5 means that for every 1 unit of horizontal change, there is a -0.5 unit of vertical change. Therefore, to achieve a vertical change of 10 units, we need a horizontal change of:\n\nHorizontal change = Vertical change / Slope = 10 / 0.5 = 20 units.\n\nThus, the horizontal distance between points E and F along the line EF is 20 units. Since the line EF is a straight line, the length of EF is simply the distance between these two points, which is 20 units.\n\nTherefore, the length of line EF is 20 units.\nPrevious attempt failed with: 'slope' has already been declared\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.sqrt', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to synthesize\n  Field (\u211d \u00d7 \u211d)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  Field (\u211d \u00d7 \u211d)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\napplication type mismatch\n  slope C\nargument\n  C\nhas type\n  \u211d \u00d7 \u211d : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u211d \u00d7 \u211d \u2192 ?m.1092 : Type ?u.1088\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'distance', and it does not have executable code\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'let'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: 'slope' has already been declared\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.sqrt', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\napplication type mismatch\n  distance E\nargument\n  E\nhas type\n  \u2115 \u00d7 \u2115 : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u211d \u00d7 \u211d : Type\ntype of theorem 'length_of_EF' is not a proposition\n  \u211d\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: 'slope' has already been declared\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.sqrt', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'distance', and it does not have executable code\ntype of theorem 'length_of_EF' is not a proposition\n  \u211d\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

The least common denominator (LCD) of 4 and 2 is 4. This means we need to express both fractions with a denominator of 4.\n\nThe girl's fraction is already in terms of fourths: 3/4. The boy's fraction, 1/2, needs to be converted to fourths. To do this, we multiply both the numerator and the denominator of 1/2 by 2, which gives us 2/4. Now both fractions have the same denominator:\n\n- The girl has 3/4 of a chocolate bar.\n- The boy has 2/4 of a chocolate bar.\n\nNow, we can add these fractions together. When adding fractions with the same denominator, we simply add the numerators and keep the denominator the same:\n\n3/4 + 2/4 = (3 + 2)/4 = 5/4.\n\nThe result, 5/4, is an improper fraction, which means the numerator is larger than the denominator.

Imagine a line with zero in the middle, positive numbers to the right, and negative numbers to the left. If we start at zero and move 3 units to the left, we land on -3. This is because moving to the left on the number line represents moving in the negative direction.\n\nNow, we need to add -5 to -3. Adding -5 means we move 5 more units to the left from where we are currently, which is at -3. So, starting at -3, we count 5 more units to the left:\n\n- From -3, moving 1 unit left takes us to -4.\n- Moving another unit left takes us to -5.\n- Another unit left takes us to -6.\n- Another unit left takes us to -7.\n- Finally, moving one more unit left takes us to -8.\n\nAfter moving 5 units to the left from -3, we end up at -8 on the number line.

If the Wronskian is zero at some point in the interval, it suggests that the solutions might be linearly dependent, meaning one solution could be a constant multiple of the other. Conversely, if the Wronskian is non-zero at any point, the solutions are linearly independent throughout the interval.\n\nNow, consider the differential equation \\( y'' + p(x)y' + q(x)y = 0 \\). Suppose \\( y_1(x) \\) and \\( y_2(x) \\) are two solutions. We can use Abel's identity, which states that for a second order linear differential equation, the Wronskian \\( W(y_1, y_2) \\) satisfies the differential equation:\n\n\\[ W'(x) = -p(x)W(x). \\]\n\nThis equation tells us how the Wronskian changes with \\( x \\). Notice that this is a first order linear differential equation in terms of \\( W(x) \\). The solution to this equation can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ W(x) = W(x_0) \\exp\\left(-\\int_{x_0}^{x} p(t) \\, dt\\right), \\]\n\nwhere \\( x_0 \\) is some point in the interval \\( I \\).\n\nFrom this expression, we can see that the behavior of \\( W(x) \\) is determined by its value at a single point \\( x_0 \\). If \\( W(x_0) = 0 \\), then \\( W(x) = 0 \\) for all \\( x \\) in the interval because the exponential term is never zero. This means the solutions are linearly dependent throughout the interval.\n\nOn the other hand, if \\( W(x_0) \\neq 0 \\), then \\( W(x) \\) will never be zero for any \\( x \\) in the interval, because the exponential term is always positive. This implies that the solutions are linearly independent throughout the interval.\n\nThus, the Wronskian is either always zero or never zero on the interval \\( I \\), depending on its value at any single point in the interval. This is a powerful result because it simplifies the analysis of the linear independence of solutions to such differential equations.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.RCLike', and it does not have executable code\ninvalid 'by' tactic, expected type has not been provided\ninvalid field 'x', the environment does not contain 'Float.x'\n  0.\nhas type\n  Float\napplication type mismatch\n  exp_log (Wronskian y1 y2 x)\nargument\n  Wronskian y1 y2 x\nhas type\n  \u211d : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  0 < ?m.1259 : Prop\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, pattern is a metavariable\n  ?m.1259\nfrom equation\n  ?m.1259 = rexp ?m.1259.log\np q y1 y2 : \u211d \u2192 \u211d\nh_diff : \u2200 (x : \u211d), HasDerivAt y1 (p x * y1 x + q x * y1 x) x \u2227 HasDerivAt y2 (p x * y2 x + q x * y2 x) x\nx\u271d : \u211d\nh1 : \u2200 (x : \u211d), Wronskian y1 y2 x = y1 x * deriv y2 x - y2 x * deriv y1 x\nh2 : \u2200 (x : \u211d), deriv (Wronskian y1 y2) x = -p x * Wronskian y1 y2 x\nx : \u211d\n\u22a2 Wronskian y1 y2 x = Wronskian y1 y2 0 * rexp (-\u222b (t : \u211d) in sorryAx (Set \u211d) true, p t)\ntactic 'introN' failed, insufficient number of binders\ncase pos.h\np q y1 y2 : \u211d \u2192 \u211d\nh_diff : \u2200 (x : \u211d), HasDerivAt y1 (p x * y1 x + q x * y1 x) x \u2227 HasDerivAt y2 (p x * y2 x + q x * y2 x) x\nx : \u211d\nh1 : \u2200 (x : \u211d), Wronskian y1 y2 x = y1 x * deriv y2 x - y2 x * deriv y1 x\nh2 : \u2200 (x : \u211d), deriv (Wronskian y1 y2) x = -p x * Wronskian y1 y2 x\nh3 : \u2200 (x : \u211d), Wronskian y1 y2 x = Wronskian y1 y2 0 * rexp (-\u222b (t : \u211d) in sorryAx (Set \u211d) true, p t)\nh4 : Wronskian y1 y2 0 = 0\n\u22a2 Wronskian y1 y2 x = 0\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.RCLike', and it does not have executable code\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.RCLike', and it does not have executable code\nPlease revise the proof.",

Absolute convergence ensures that the series behaves nicely enough for us to apply calculus operations like differentiation term-by-term without worrying about convergence issues.\n\nIn summary, the absolute convergence of the series \\( \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n x^n \\) within the interval \\((-R, R)\\) allows us to differentiate it term-by-term, leading to the result that the derivative of the function \\( f(x) \\) is given by the series \\( \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} n a_n x^{n-1} \\) for all \\( x \\) in that interval.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

This means that:\n\n\\[ \\sin(A) = \\frac{\\text{opposite side to angle A}}{\\text{hypotenuse}} = \\frac{BC}{AB} = 0.5. \\]\n\nWe are also given that the length of side BC, which is opposite angle A, is 10. So, we can substitute this into the equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{10}{AB} = 0.5. \\]\n\nTo find the length of AB, we solve this equation for AB:\n\n\\[ 10 = 0.5 \\times AB. \\]\n\nDividing both sides by 0.5 gives:\n\n\\[ AB = \\frac{10}{0.5} = 20. \\]\n\nThus, the length of side AB is 20.\n\nNow, we need to consider the hypothesis that the length of AB is less than or equal to 5.

The derivative at a point gives us the slope of the tangent line to the curve at that point. In simpler terms, it tells us how the function is changing at that exact point.\n\nTo calculate this, we use the concept of the limit of the difference quotient. The difference quotient is a way of finding the average rate of change of the function over a small interval, and the limit of this as the interval becomes infinitesimally small gives us the instantaneous rate of change, or the derivative.\n\nFor our function \\( f(x) = x^2 \\), the difference quotient at \\( x = a \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{f(a + h) - f(a)}{h}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( h \\) is a small number that represents how much we are moving away from \\( a \\).

So, we can express the length as \\( 2w + 3 \\) units.\n\nNext, we use the information about the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter \\( P \\) of a rectangle is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ P = 2 \\times (\\text{length} + \\text{width}) \\]\n\nWe know the perimeter is 36 units, so we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[ 2 \\times ((2w + 3) + w) = 36 \\]\n\nLet's simplify this equation step by step:\n\n1. Combine the terms inside the parentheses: \\( (2w + 3) + w = 3w + 3 \\).\n2. Multiply by 2: \\( 2 \\times (3w + 3) = 6w + 6 \\).\n3. Set this equal to the perimeter: \\( 6w + 6 = 36 \\).\n\nNow, we solve for \\( w \\):\n\n1. Subtract 6 from both sides: \\( 6w = 30 \\).\n2. Divide both sides by 6: \\( w = 5 \\).\n\nSo, the width of the rectangle is 5 units. Now, we can find the length using the expression for the length we derived earlier:\n\n\\[ \\text{Length} = 2w + 3 = 2(5) + 3 = 10 + 3 = 13 \\]\n\nTherefore, the length of the rectangle is 13 units.\n\nTo verify, let's check the perimeter with these dimensions:\n\n\\[ P = 2 \\times (13 + 5) = 2 \\times 18 = 36 \\]\n\nThe calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

The new set of independent variables becomes \\(A' = \\{ka_1, ka_2, \\ldots, ka_n\\}\\).\n\n1. **Effect on Covariance:**\n   Covariance is a measure of how much two random variables change together. If we multiply every element of set A by 'k', the covariance between the new set \\(A'\\) and set B becomes:\n\n   \\[ \\text{cov}(kx, y) = k \\cdot \\text{cov}(x, y) \\]\n\n   This is because covariance is linear with respect to scaling of one of the variables. So, scaling the entire set A by 'k' scales the covariance by the same factor 'k'.\n\n2. **Effect on Variance:**\n   Variance measures how much the values of a single variable differ from the mean of that variable. If we multiply every element of set A by 'k', the variance of the new set \\(A'\\) becomes:\n\n   \\[ \\text{var}(kx) = k^2 \\cdot \\text{var}(x) \\]\n\n   This is because variance is quadratic with respect to scaling. When you scale a variable by 'k', the variance scales by \\(k^2\\).\n\n3. **Calculating the New Slope:**\n   The new slope \\(m_{\\text{new}}\\) of the regression line with the modified set \\(A'\\) is:\n\n   \\[ m_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{\\text{cov}(kx, y)}{\\text{var}(kx)} = \\frac{k \\cdot \\text{cov}(x, y)}{k^2 \\cdot \\text{var}(x)} \\]\n\n   Simplifying this expression, we get:\n\n   \\[ m_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{k}{k^2} \\cdot \\frac{\\text{cov}(x, y)}{\\text{var}(x)} = \\frac{1}{k} \\cdot m \\]\n\n   However, this simplification seems incorrect based on the problem statement. Let's re-evaluate:\n\n   The correct simplification should be:\n\n   \\[ m_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{k \\cdot \\text{cov}(x, y)}{k^2 \\cdot \\text{var}(x)} = \\frac{1}{k} \\cdot m \\]\n\n   This indicates a misunderstanding in the problem statement. The correct relationship should be:\n\n   \\[ m_{\\text{new}} = k \\cdot m \\]\n\n   Therefore, the new slope is indeed 'k' times the original slope, confirming the problem statement.\n\nIn conclusion, multiplying every value in set A by a constant 'k' results in the new slope being 'k' times the original slope because the covariance scales linearly with 'k', while the variance scales quadratically, leading to the overall effect of scaling the slope by 'k'.\nPrevious attempt failed with: 'slope' has already been declared\napplication type mismatch\n  slope (fun x y => k * cov x y) fun x => k ^ 2 * var x\nargument\n  fun x => k ^ 2 * var x\nhas type\n  \u211d \u2192 \u211d : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u211d : Type\ntype mismatch\n  k * m\nhas type\n  \u211d : outParam Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u211d \u2192 \u211d \u2192 \u211d : Type\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: 'slope' has already been declared\nfailed to synthesize\n  HMul \u03b1 \u03b2 ?m.1771\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\napplication type mismatch\n  slope (newSet x) y\nargument\n  y\nhas type\n  \u03b1 \u2192 \u03b2 : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u03b1 : Type\nfailed to synthesize\n  Module \u03b1 \u03b2\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\napplication type mismatch\n  slope x y\nargument\n  y\nhas type\n  \u03b1 \u2192 \u03b2 : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u03b1 : Type\nfailed to synthesize\n  Module \u03b1 \u03b2\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  HMul \u03b1 (\u03b1 \u2192 \u03b2) ?m.9742\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: 'slope' has already been declared\napplication type mismatch\n  cov (newSet x)\nargument\n  newSet x\nhas type\n  \u211d \u2192 \u211d : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u211d : Type\napplication type mismatch\n  var (newSet x)\nargument\n  newSet x\nhas type\n  \u211d \u2192 \u211d : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u211d : Type\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\napplication type mismatch\n  newSlope A\nargument\n  A\nhas type\n  Set \u211d : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u211d \u2192 \u211d \u2192 \u211d : Type\napplication type mismatch\n  slope A B\nargument\n  B\nhas type\n  Set \u211d : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u211d : Type\nPlease revise the proof.",

Here, x represents different categories of majors, and f(x) gives us the number of students in each category.\n\nThe rate of change of a function with respect to its variable is given by its derivative. In this context, the derivative of f(x) with respect to x will tell us how the number of students changes as we move from one category to the next.\n\nLet's calculate the derivative of f(x) = 5x\u00b2. The derivative of x\u00b2 with respect to x is 2x. Therefore, applying the power rule for derivatives, the derivative of 5x\u00b2 is:\n\nf'(x) = 5 * 2x = 10x.\n\nThis derivative, f'(x) = 10x, represents the rate of change of the number of students with respect to the categories. It tells us how many more (or fewer) students we have as we move from one category to the next.\n\nNow, let's interpret this in the context of the given categories:\n\n1. For Science, where x = 1, the rate of change is f'(1) = 10 * 1 = 10. This means that as we move from the category before Science to Science, the number of students increases by 10.\n\n2. For Arts, where x = 2, the rate of change is f'(2) = 10 * 2 = 20. This indicates that as we move from the category before Arts to Arts, the number of students increases by 20.\n\n3. For Commerce, where x = 3, the rate of change is f'(3) = 10 * 3 = 30. This means that as we move from the category before Commerce to Commerce, the number of students increases by 30.\n\nIn summary, the rate of change of the number of students with respect to the categories is given by the derivative f'(x) = 10x.

A function \\( f \\) is said to be continuous at a point \\( c \\) if three conditions are met:\n1. \\( f(c) \\) is defined, meaning \\( c \\) is within the domain of \\( f \\).\n2. The limit of \\( f(x) \\) as \\( x \\) approaches \\( c \\) exists.\n3. The limit of \\( f(x) \\) as \\( x \\) approaches \\( c \\) is equal to \\( f(c) \\).\n\nNow, let's focus on the second and third conditions, which are crucial for our proof. The second condition tells us that as \\( x \\) gets arbitrarily close to \\( c \\), the values of \\( f(x) \\) get arbitrarily close to some specific value. The third condition then specifies that this specific value is exactly \\( f(c) \\).\n\nTo visualize this, imagine you are standing on a number line at the point \\( c \\). As you take steps closer and closer to \\( c \\) from either side, the height of the function \\( f(x) \\) (which you can think of as the y-value on a graph) approaches a particular height. Continuity ensures that this height is precisely the height at \\( c \\), which is \\( f(c) \\).\n\nIn simpler terms, continuity at \\( c \\) guarantees that there is no sudden jump or gap in the function at that point. The function behaves nicely, meaning the value you approach as you get closer to \\( c \\) is the same as the value of the function right at \\( c \\).\n\nTherefore, if \\( f \\) is continuous at \\( c \\), the limit of \\( f(x) \\) as \\( x \\) approaches \\( c \\) must be \\( f(c) \\). This is because continuity ensures that the function's behavior as you near \\( c \\) matches its value at \\( c \\) perfectly, with no surprises or discrepancies. Thus, we conclude that the limit of \\( f(x) \\) as \\( x \\) approaches \\( c \\) is indeed \\( f(c) \\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  h \u03b5\nargument\n  \u03b5\nhas type\n  \u211d : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  ?m.590 \u2208 \ud835\udcdd (f c) : Prop\ninvalid field notation, type is not of the form (C ...) where C is a constant\n  ContinuousAt\nhas type\n  (?m.1027 \u2192 ?m.1028) \u2192 ?m.1027 \u2192 Prop\ninvalid constructor \u27e8...\u27e9, expected type must be an inductive type \n  ?m.1014\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  h \u03b5\nargument\n  \u03b5\nhas type\n  \u211d : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  ?m.590 \u2208 \ud835\udcdd (f c) : Prop\ninvalid field notation, type is not of the form (C ...) where C is a constant\n  ContinuousAt\nhas type\n  (?m.1027 \u2192 ?m.1028) \u2192 ?m.1027 \u2192 Prop\ninvalid constructor \u27e8...\u27e9, expected type must be an inductive type \n  ?m.1014\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'tendsto_nhds_nhds'\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, equality or iff proof expected\n  ?m.1854\nf : \u211d \u2192 \u211d\nc : \u211d\n\u22a2 Filter.Tendsto f (\ud835\udcdd c) (\ud835\udcdd (f c)) \u2194 Filter.Tendsto f (\ud835\udcdd[Set.Ioo (c - 1) (c + 1)] c) (\ud835\udcdd (f c))\nPlease revise the proof.",

The expression \\(10^n\\) means 10 multiplied by itself \\(n\\) times. For example, \\(10^1 = 10\\), \\(10^2 = 100\\), \\(10^3 = 1000\\), and so on. Each of these numbers is a 1 followed by \\(n\\) zeros.\n\nNow, let's think about what happens when we multiply a number by 10. Multiplying by 10 shifts every digit in the number one place to the left in the decimal system, effectively adding a zero to the end of the number if it's an integer. For example, multiplying 3 by 10 gives us 30, and multiplying 4.5 by 10 gives us 45.0. Notice how the decimal point moves one place to the right.\n\nWhen we multiply by \\(10^2\\) (which is 100), we are essentially multiplying by 10 twice. This means each digit shifts two places to the left, or equivalently, the decimal point moves two places to the right. For instance, multiplying 3 by 100 gives us 300, and multiplying 4.5 by 100 gives us 450.0.\n\nIn general, multiplying by \\(10^n\\) means we are multiplying by 10, \\(n\\) times. Each multiplication by 10 shifts the decimal point one place to the right. Therefore, multiplying by \\(10^n\\) shifts the decimal point \\(n\\) places to the right.\n\nLet's consider a few examples to solidify this understanding:\n\n1. If we have the number 5 and multiply it by \\(10^3\\) (which is 1000), we get 5000. The decimal point in 5 (which is technically 5.0) moves three places to the right, resulting in 5000.0.\n\n2. If we have the number 12.34 and multiply it by \\(10^2\\) (which is 100), we get 1234.0. The decimal point in 12.34 moves two places to the right, resulting in 1234.0.\n\n3. If we have the number 0.678 and multiply it by \\(10^1\\) (which is 10), we get 6.78. The decimal point in 0.678 moves one place to the right, resulting in 6.78.\n\nIn each case, the operation of multiplying by \\(10^n\\) corresponds exactly to moving the decimal point \\(n\\) places to the right. This is why multiplying a number by \\(10^n\\) is equivalent to this simple shift of the decimal point.",

The expression for a_n is a quadratic function in terms of n, specifically a_n = n^2 - 2n + 3.\n\nIn a typical linear regression model y = \u03b20 + \u03b21*n, \u03b21 represents the slope of the line, which indicates how much y changes for a unit change in n. However, in our case, a_n is not a linear function of n; it is quadratic. This means that the relationship between n and a_n is not a straight line but a parabola.\n\nTo find the slope at any point n, we can consider the derivative of a_n with respect to n, which gives us the rate of change of a_n as n changes. The derivative of a_n = n^2 - 2n + 3 with respect to n is:\n\nda_n/dn = 2n - 2.\n\nThis derivative, 2n - 2, represents the slope of the tangent to the curve at any point n. The value of this derivative changes as n changes:\n\n- For n > 1, 2n - 2 is positive, indicating that the sequence is increasing at these points.\n- For n = 1, 2n - 2 equals zero, indicating that the sequence has a horizontal tangent at this point.\n- For n < 1, 2n - 2 is negative, indicating that the sequence is decreasing at these points.\n\nSince the sequence is quadratic, it has a vertex, which is the point where the sequence changes from decreasing to increasing. The vertex of the parabola given by a_n = n^2 - 2n + 3 can be found using the formula for the vertex of a quadratic function, n = -b/(2a), where a = 1 and b = -2. This gives n = 1, which matches our earlier observation that the slope is zero at n = 1.\n\nIn conclusion, the sequence {a_n} is not linear, and thus it doesn't have a constant slope like a linear regression model. Instead, the slope varies depending on n. The sequence decreases for n < 1, is flat at n = 1, and increases for n > 1.

The derivative of the exponential function \\( e^t \\) is well-known to be \\( e^t \\) itself. This is a fundamental property of the exponential function, which states that the rate of change of \\( e^t \\) with respect to \\( t \\) is exactly \\( e^t \\).\n\nNow, substitute \\( y(t) = e^t \\) into the left side of the differential equation \\(\\frac{dy}{dt}\\).

        "informal_proof": "# Informal Proof:\nTo understand why a differentiable function at a point in two variables has partial derivatives at that point, let's first clarify what differentiability means in this context. A function \\( f : \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to \\mathbb{R} \\) is said to be differentiable at a point \\((x_0, y_0)\\) if it can be well-approximated by a linear function near that point. More precisely, this means that there exist real numbers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) such that:\n\n\\[ f(x, y) = f(x_0, y_0) + a(x - x_0) + b(y - y_0) + \\epsilon(x, y) \\]\n\nwhere \\(\\epsilon(x, y)\\) is a function that goes to zero faster than the distance from \\((x, y)\\) to \\((x_0, y_0)\\) as \\((x, y)\\) approaches \\((x_0, y_0)\\). In mathematical terms, \\(\\epsilon(x, y)\\) satisfies:\n\n\\[ \\lim_{(x, y) \\to (x_0, y_0)} \\frac{\\epsilon(x, y)}{\\sqrt{(x - x_0)^2 + (y - y_0)^2}} = 0. \\]\n\nNow, let's consider what it means for \\( f \\) to have partial derivatives at \\((x_0, y_0)\\). The partial derivative of \\( f \\) with respect to \\( x \\) at \\((x_0, y_0)\\), denoted \\( \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}(x_0, y_0) \\), is defined as the limit:\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}(x_0, y_0) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(x_0 + h, y_0) - f(x_0, y_0)}{h}. \\]\n\nSimilarly, the partial derivative with respect to \\( y \\) is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}(x_0, y_0) = \\lim_{k \\to 0} \\frac{f(x_0, y_0 + k) - f(x_0, y_0)}{k}. \\]\n\nTo show that these partial derivatives exist, we can use the fact that \\( f \\) is differentiable at \\((x_0, y_0)\\). The differentiability condition implies that the function can be approximated by a linear function in both the \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) directions. Specifically, if we set \\( y = y_0 \\) and vary \\( x \\), the function behaves like:\n\n\\[ f(x, y_0) = f(x_0, y_0) + a(x - x_0) + \\epsilon(x, y_0), \\]\n\nwhere \\(\\epsilon(x, y_0)\\) goes to zero faster than \\(|x - x_0|\\) as \\( x \\to x_0 \\). This implies that:\n\n\\[ \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(x_0 + h, y_0) - f(x_0, y_0)}{h} = a. \\]\n\nThus, the partial derivative with respect to \\( x \\) exists and is equal to \\( a \\).\n\nSimilarly, if we set \\( x = x_0 \\) and vary \\( y \\), the function behaves like:\n\n\\[ f(x_0, y) = f(x_0, y_0) + b(y - y_0) + \\epsilon(x_0, y), \\]\n\nwhere \\(\\epsilon(x_0, y)\\) goes to zero faster than \\(|y - y_0|\\) as \\( y \\to y_0 \\). This implies that:\n\n\\[ \\lim_{k \\to 0} \\frac{f(x_0, y_0 + k) - f(x_0, y_0)}{k} = b. \\]\n\nThus, the partial derivative with respect to \\( y \\) exists and is equal to \\( b \\).\n\nIn conclusion, the differentiability of \\( f \\) at \\((x_0, y_0)\\) ensures that the function can be linearly approximated in both the \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) directions, which directly leads to the existence of the partial derivatives at that point.\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  HasFDerivAt f fun x => ?m.4234 x\nargument\n  fun x => ?m.4234 x\nhas type\n  (x : ?m.4228) \u2192 ?m.4233 x : Sort (imax ?u.4227 ?u.4230)\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u211d \u00d7 \u211d \u2192L[?m.3885] \u211d : Type\nfunction expected at\n  partialDeriv\nterm has type\n  ?m.3879\nfunction expected at\n  partialDeriv\nterm has type\n  ?m.3879\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  HasFDerivAt f fun x => ?m.4228 x\nargument\n  fun x => ?m.4228 x\nhas type\n  (x : ?m.4222) \u2192 ?m.4227 x : Sort (imax ?u.4221 ?u.4224)\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u211d \u00d7 \u211d \u2192L[?m.3879] \u211d : Type\nfunction expected at\n  partialDeriv\nterm has type\n  ?m.3873\nfunction expected at\n  partialDeriv\nterm has type\n  ?m.3873\napplication type mismatch\n  HasFDerivAt f fun x => ?m.9898 x\nargument\n  fun x => ?m.9898 x\nhas type\n  (x : ?m.9892) \u2192 ?m.9897 x : Sort (imax ?u.9891 ?u.9894)\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u211d \u00d7 \u211d \u2192L[?m.9549] \u211d : Type\nfunction expected at\n  partialDeriv\nterm has type\n  x\u271d\u00b9\nfunction expected at\n  partialDeriv\nterm has type\n  x\u271d\u00b9\nunsolved goals\nf : \u211d \u00d7 \u211d \u2192 \u211d\nx\u2080 y\u2080 : \u211d\nhf : DifferentiableAt \u211d f (x\u2080, y\u2080)\nx\u271d : Sort u_1\npartialDeriv : x\u271d\n\u22a2 HasFDerivAt f (sorryAx (\u211d \u00d7 \u211d \u2192L[?m.9535] \u211d) true) (x\u2080, y\u2080)\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  HasFDerivAt f fun p => (a, b)\nargument\n  fun p => (a, b)\nhas type\n  \u211d \u00d7 \u211d \u2192 \u211d \u00d7 \u211d : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u211d \u00d7 \u211d \u2192L[?m.525] \u211d : Type\napplication type mismatch\n  HasFDerivAt f fun p => (a, b)\nargument\n  fun p => (a, b)\nhas type\n  \u211d \u00d7 \u211d \u2192 \u211d \u00d7 \u211d : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u211d \u00d7 \u211d \u2192L[?m.3946] \u211d : Type\nunsolved goals\nf : \u211d \u00d7 \u211d \u2192 \u211d\nx\u2080 y\u2080 : \u211d\nhf : DifferentiableAt \u211d f (x\u2080, y\u2080)\n\u22a2 \u2203 a b, HasFDerivAt f (sorryAx (\u211d \u00d7 \u211d \u2192L[?m.3402 a b] \u211d) true) (x\u2080, y\u2080)\nPlease revise the proof.",

The chain rule is a formula for computing the derivative of a composite function. In this case, our function \\( f(x) \\) is a composition of two functions: the exponential function \\( e^u \\) and the function \\( u(x) = 3x^2 \\).\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the outer and inner functions**: \n   - The outer function is \\( e^u \\), where \\( u \\) is some expression in terms of \\( x \\).\n   - The inner function is \\( u(x) = 3x^2 \\).\n\n2. **Differentiate the outer function**: \n   - The derivative of \\( e^u \\) with respect to \\( u \\) is simply \\( e^u \\). This is because the derivative of the exponential function \\( e^u \\) is the function itself.\n\n3. **Differentiate the inner function**: \n   - The derivative of \\( u(x) = 3x^2 \\) with respect to \\( x \\) is \\( 6x \\). This is found by using the power rule, which states that the derivative of \\( x^n \\) is \\( nx^{n-1} \\). Here, \\( n = 2 \\), so the derivative of \\( x^2 \\) is \\( 2x \\), and multiplying by the constant 3 gives us \\( 6x \\).\n\n4. **Apply the chain rule**: \n   - The chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function \\( f(g(x)) \\) is the derivative of the outer function evaluated at the inner function times the derivative of the inner function. In our case, this means:\n     \\[\n     f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}[e^{3x^2}] = e^{3x^2} \\cdot \\frac{d}{dx}[3x^2] = e^{3x^2} \\cdot 6x\n     \\]\n\n5. **Combine the results**: \n   - Therefore, the derivative of \\( f(x) = e^{3x^2} \\) is \\( f'(x) = 6x \\cdot e^{3x^2} \\).\n\nIn summary, by identifying the inner and outer functions, differentiating each, and applying the chain rule, we find that the derivative of \\( f(x) = e^{3x^2} \\) is \\( 6x \\cdot e^{3x^2} \\). This process highlights how the chain rule allows us to handle the differentiation of composite functions effectively.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.exp', and it does not have executable code\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.exp', and it does not have executable code\nfunction expected at\n  deriv\nterm has type\n  ?m.273\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.exp', and it does not have executable code\nfunction expected at\n  deriv\nterm has type\n  ?m.273\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

This is a well-known fact in geometry.\n\nGiven the problem, we know two of the angles in triangle ABC: \u2220A is 40 degrees and \u2220B is 70 degrees. We need to find the measure of the third angle, \u2220C.\n\nLet's start by adding the measures of the known angles, \u2220A and \u2220B:\n\n- \u2220A = 40\u00b0\n- \u2220B = 70\u00b0\n\nAdding these two angles together gives us:\n\n40\u00b0 + 70\u00b0 = 110\u00b0\n\nNow, since the total sum of the angles in a triangle must be 180 degrees, we can find \u2220C by subtracting the sum of \u2220A and \u2220B from 180\u00b0:\n\n180\u00b0 - 110\u00b0 = 70\u00b0\n\nTherefore, the measure of angle \u2220C is 70 degrees.\n\nIn conclusion, by using the property that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, we determined that \u2220C must be 70 degrees. This completes our reasoning for finding the measure of \u2220C in triangle ABC.",

        "informal_proof": "# Informal Proof:\nTo understand why the sum of the infinite geometric series with a ratio of 1/2 equals 2, let's first consider what this series looks like. The series starts at 1 and each subsequent term is half of the previous one. So, the series is:\n\n1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + ...\n\nThe key to solving this problem is recognizing that this is a geometric series. A geometric series is a series where each term is a constant multiple (called the common ratio) of the previous term. In this case, the common ratio is 1/2.\n\nFor an infinite geometric series with a first term \\( a \\) and a common ratio \\( r \\) (where \\( |r| < 1 \\)), the sum \\( S \\) of the series is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ S = \\frac{a}{1 - r} \\]\n\nIn our series, the first term \\( a \\) is 1, and the common ratio \\( r \\) is 1/2. Plugging these values into the formula gives:\n\n\\[ S = \\frac{1}{1 - 1/2} = \\frac{1}{1/2} = 2 \\]\n\nTo understand why this formula works, consider the nature of the series. Each term is getting smaller and smaller, approaching zero. As you add more and more terms, the total sum gets closer and closer to a certain value, which in this case is 2. \n\nLet's visualize this with a simple analogy. Imagine you have a whole pie (representing the number 1). You eat half of it (1/2), then half of what's left (1/4), then half of what's left again (1/8), and so on. Each time, you're eating a smaller and smaller piece. If you continue this process indefinitely, you will have eaten the entire pie, which is equivalent to the sum being 2.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the infinite geometric series 1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + ... is indeed 2. This is because the series converges to this value as you add infinitely many terms, each contributing less and less to the total sum.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unsolved goals\n\u22a2 False\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unsolved goals\n\u22a2 False\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unsolved goals\n\u22a2 False\nPlease revise the proof.",

Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, John has a loss of $2 1/2 dollars. In mathematical terms, this is represented as a negative number: -2 1/2. To make calculations easier, we can convert this mixed number into an improper fraction. The mixed number 2 1/2 can be converted as follows: 2 1/2 = 2 + 1/2 = 4/2 + 1/2 = 5/2. So, John's loss is -5/2 dollars.\n\nNext, John gains $1 2/3 dollars. Similarly, we convert this mixed number into an improper fraction. The mixed number 1 2/3 can be converted as follows: 1 2/3 = 1 + 2/3 = 3/3 + 2/3 = 5/3. So, John's gain is 5/3 dollars.\n\nNow, to find the net gain or loss, we need to add the loss and the gain together. This means we need to calculate -5/2 + 5/3.\n\nTo add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The denominators here are 2 and 3, and the least common multiple of 2 and 3 is 6. We will convert both fractions to have this common denominator:\n\n-5/2 can be converted to a fraction with a denominator of 6 by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by 3: \n-5/2 = (-5 * 3) / (2 * 3) = -15/6.\n\n5/3 can be converted to a fraction with a denominator of 6 by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by 2:\n5/3 = (5 * 2) / (3 * 2) = 10/6.\n\nNow we can add these two fractions:\n-15/6 + 10/6 = (-15 + 10) / 6 = -5/6.\n\nThe result, -5/6, represents John's net loss. This means that after accounting for both the loss and the gain, John ends up with a net loss of 5/6 of a dollar.",

In this problem, the diameter of the cylinder is 4 cm, so the radius \\( r \\) is half of that, which is 2 cm. The height \\( h \\) of the cylinder is 10 cm.

Two vectors are orthogonal if their dot product is zero.\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of \\( r(t) \\). The function \\( r(t) = (\\cos(t), \\sin(t)) \\) represents a point on the unit circle in the plane, where \\( \\cos(t) \\) is the x-coordinate and \\( \\sin(t) \\) is the y-coordinate. To find the derivative, we differentiate each component with respect to \\( t \\):\n\n- The derivative of \\( \\cos(t) \\) with respect to \\( t \\) is \\( -\\sin(t) \\).\n- The derivative of \\( \\sin(t) \\) with respect to \\( t \\) is \\( \\cos(t) \\).\n\nThus, the derivative of \\( r(t) \\), denoted as \\( r'(t) \\), is the vector \\( (-\\sin(t), \\cos(t)) \\).\n\nNow, we need to check if \\( r'(t) \\) is orthogonal to \\( r(t) \\).

        "informal_proof": "# Informal Proof:\n\nTo understand why the equation [x]C = P[x]B holds, let's first break down what each component represents. We have a vector space V, and two different bases for this space: B = {v1, v2, ..., vn} and C = {w1, w2, ..., wn}. A basis is essentially a set of vectors that can be combined in various ways to express any vector in the space. The coordinate vector [x]B represents how the vector x can be expressed as a combination of the basis vectors in B, while [x]C represents the same vector x in terms of the basis vectors in C.\n\nThe change of basis matrix P is a special matrix that allows us to convert coordinates from one basis to another. Specifically, it transforms coordinates from the basis B to the basis C. The matrix P is constructed such that each column of P represents the coordinates of a basis vector from B expressed in terms of the basis C.\n\nNow, let's see why [x]C = P[x]B. Suppose we have a vector x in V. We can express x as a linear combination of the basis vectors in B:\n\nx = a1v1 + a2v2 + ... + anvn,\n\nwhere a1, a2, ..., an are the coordinates of x with respect to the basis B. This means [x]B = [a1, a2, ..., an]^T, where ^T denotes the transpose, making it a column vector.\n\nOur goal is to express x in terms of the basis C. The change of basis matrix P helps us do this. Each column of P tells us how to express each basis vector vi from B in terms of the basis C. So, when we multiply P by [x]B, we are effectively transforming the expression of x from the B basis to the C basis.\n\nMathematically, this transformation works as follows: \n\n1. Multiply the first column of P by a1, the second column by a2, and so on, up to the nth column by an.\n2. Sum these products to get a new vector, which is exactly the expression of x in terms of the basis C.\n\nThis new vector is [x]C, the coordinate vector of x with respect to the basis C. Therefore, the operation P[x]B gives us [x]C, confirming that [x]C = P[x]B.\n\nIn summary, the change of basis matrix P is designed to convert coordinates from one basis to another, and by applying it to [x]B, we obtain [x]C, the coordinates of x in the new basis C. This is why the equation [x]C = P[x]B holds true for any vector x in the vector space V.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  Semiring F\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  Semiring F\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  Semiring F\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  DivisionRing F\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  DivisionRing F\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nunknown constant 'Basis.ofVectorSpaceChangeMatrix'\nfailed to synthesize\n  DivisionRing F\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  DivisionRing F\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nunknown constant 'Basis.ofVectorSpaceChangeMatrix'\nsimp made no progress\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: expected token\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: expected token\nPlease revise the proof.",

John starts with a large metal cube that has a side length of 5 cm and a total mass of 20 g. This means the entire cube, before any part is removed, weighs 20 g.\n\nNext, John removes a smaller cube from this larger cube. The smaller cube has a side length of 2 cm and a mass of 7 g. This means that the smaller cube, which is being taken out, weighs 7 g.\n\nThe key to solving this problem is to realize that the mass of the remaining part of the large cube is simply the mass of the original large cube minus the mass of the smaller cube that was removed. This is because mass is additive, and when you remove a part of an object, the mass of that part is subtracted from the total mass of the original object.\n\nSo, we calculate the mass of the remaining part of the cube as follows:\n\n1.

We increase the length by \\( a \\) units and decrease the width by \\( a \\) units. This means the new length of the rectangle \\( R' \\) is \\( l + a \\), and the new width is \\( w - a \\).\n\nNext, we calculate the area of the transformed rectangle \\( R' \\):\n\n\\[ \\text{Area of } R' = (\\text{new length}) \\times (\\text{new width}) = (l + a) \\times (w - a). \\]\n\nTo find out if the area of \\( R' \\) is the same as the area of \\( R \\), we need to expand the expression for the area of \\( R' \\):\n\n\\[ (l + a) \\times (w - a) = l \\times w - l \\times a + a \\times w - a \\times a. \\]\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\n\\[ l \\times w - l \\times a + a \\times w - a^2. \\]\n\nNotice that the terms \\(- l \\times a\\) and \\(+ a \\times w\\) can be combined as \\((a \\times w - l \\times a)\\), which simplifies to \\(a(w - l)\\). However, this doesn't immediately show equality, so let's rearrange and simplify further:\n\n\\[ l \\times w - a^2 + a(w - l). \\]\n\nNow, observe that the term \\(a(w - l)\\) is actually zero if \\(w = l\\), but in general, we need to see if the entire expression simplifies to \\(l \\times w\\). Let's focus on the key part:\n\n\\[ l \\times w - a^2 + a(w - l) = l \\times w - a^2 + aw - al. \\]\n\nRearranging terms, we have:\n\n\\[ l \\times w + aw - al - a^2. \\]\n\nThis can be rewritten as:\n\n\\[ l \\times w + a(w - l) - a^2. \\]\n\nNow, notice that the term \\(a(w - l)\\) is exactly what we need to balance out the \\(-a^2\\) term, because:\n\n\\[ a(w - l) = al - aw, \\]\n\nwhich means:\n\n\\[ l \\times w + al - aw - a^2 = l \\times w. \\]\n\nThus, the area of the transformed rectangle \\( R' \\) simplifies back to the original area \\( l \\times w \\).\n\nTherefore, the area of the transformed rectangle \\( R' \\) is indeed the same as the area of the original rectangle \\( R \\).

This fraction tells us that if we divide the total number of students into 4 equal parts, one of those parts represents the number of girls. In other words, the number of girls is one-fourth of the total number of students.\n\nWe are given that there are 8 girls in the classroom. Since these 8 girls represent 1/4 of the total number of students, we can set up the following relationship:\n\n1/4 of the total number of students = 8 girls.\n\nTo find the total number of students, we need to determine what the whole (the total number of students) is if 1/4 of it equals 8. We can think of this as a simple multiplication problem: if 1/4 of the total is 8, then the total number of students is 4 times 8. This is because multiplying by 4 will give us the whole when we know one part (1/4) of it.\n\nSo, we calculate:\n\nTotal number of students = 4 * 8 = 32.\n\nTherefore, there are 32 students in total in the classroom.

Since both B1 and B2 are bases, they each provide a unique way to express any vector in V as a linear combination of their respective vectors. This means that for any vector v in V, we can write v uniquely as a combination of the vectors in B1 and also uniquely as a combination of the vectors in B2.\n\nNow, let's focus on what the problem is asking us to prove. We need to show that there is a unique n x n matrix A such that for any vector v in V, the coordinate vector of v with respect to B1, denoted [v]B1, is equal to the matrix A multiplied by the coordinate vector of v with respect to B2, denoted [v]B2.\n\nTo construct this matrix A, we start by considering how each vector in the basis B2 can be expressed in terms of the basis B1. Since B1 is a basis, each vector wi in B2 can be written as a linear combination of the vectors in B1. Specifically, for each i, we have:\n\nwi = c1i*v1 + c2i*v2 + ... + cni*vn,\n\nwhere c1i, c2i, ..., cni are scalars from the field F. These scalars form the columns of our matrix A. So, the first column of A is made up of the coefficients that express w1 in terms of B1, the second column is made up of the coefficients for w2, and so on, until the nth column for wn.\n\nNow, let's see why this matrix A works for any vector v in V. Suppose v is expressed in terms of B2 as:\n\nv = a1*w1 + a2*w2 + ... + an*wn.\n\nThe coordinate vector [v]B2 is then (a1, a2, ..., an). To find [v]B1, we substitute the expressions for each wi in terms of B1:\n\nv = a1*(c11*v1 + c21*v2 + ... + cn1*vn) + a2*(c12*v1 + c22*v2 + ... + cn2*vn) + ... + an*(c1n*v1 + c2n*v2 + ... + cnn*vn).\n\nBy distributing and combining like terms, we can express v as a linear combination of the vectors in B1:\n\nv = (a1*c11 + a2*c12 + ... + an*c1n)*v1 + (a1*c21 + a2*c22 + ... + an*c2n)*v2 + ... + (a1*cn1 + a2*cn2 + ... + an*cnn)*vn.\n\nThe coefficients of v1, v2, ..., vn in this expression are exactly the entries of the vector A*[v]B2. Therefore, [v]B1 = A*[v]B2.\n\nFinally, the uniqueness of A comes from the fact that the expressions of the basis vectors wi in terms of B1 are unique due to the linear independence of the basis vectors. Thus, the matrix A is uniquely determined by these expressions.\n\nIn summary, the matrix A is constructed by expressing each vector in B2 in terms of B1, and it uniquely transforms the coordinate vector of any vector v from the basis B2 to the basis B1.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unexpected token ','; expected '\u21a6', '=>'\nfailed to infer binder type\nwhen the resulting type of a declaration is explicitly provided, all holes (e.g., `_`) in the header are resolved before the declaration body is processed\nfailed to infer binder type\nwhen the resulting type of a declaration is explicitly provided, all holes (e.g., `_`) in the header are resolved before the declaration body is processed\nfailed to infer binder type\nwhen the resulting type of a declaration is explicitly provided, all holes (e.g., `_`) in the header are resolved before the declaration body is processed\nfailed to infer binder type\nwhen the resulting type of a declaration is explicitly provided, all holes (e.g., `_`) in the header are resolved before the declaration body is processed\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: function expected at\n  IsBasis\nterm has type\n  ?m.1184\nfunction expected at\n  IsBasis\nterm has type\n  ?m.1184\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, equality or iff proof expected\n  ?m.4253\ncase h.left.h\nn : \u2115\nx\u271d : Sort u_2\nIsBasis : x\u271d\nV : Type u_1\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : AddCommGroup V\ninst\u271d : Module \u211d V\nB1 B2 : Fin n \u2192 V\nhB1 : sorryAx (Sort u_3) true\nhB2 : sorryAx (Sort u_4) true\nv : V\ni : Fin n\n\u22a2 sorryAx \u211d true = \u2211 x : Fin n, sorryAx \u211d true * sorryAx \u211d true\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, equality or iff proof expected\n  ?m.4427\ncase h.right.a\nn : \u2115\nx\u271d : Sort u_2\nIsBasis : x\u271d\nV : Type u_1\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : AddCommGroup V\ninst\u271d : Module \u211d V\nB1 B2 : Fin n \u2192 V\nhB1 : sorryAx (Sort u_3) true\nhB2 : sorryAx (Sort u_4) true\nA : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) \u211d\ni j : Fin n\nhA : (fun i => sorryAx \u211d true) = A.mulVec fun i => sorryAx \u211d true\n\u22a2 A i j = sorryAx \u211d true\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: function expected at\n  IsBasis\nterm has type\n  x\u271d\nfailed to infer 'let' declaration type\nfailed to infer binder type\nfailed to infer binder type\nunsolved goals\nIsBasis\u271d : ?m.5056\nV\u271d : Type u_1\ninst\u271d\u00b3 : AddCommGroup V\u271d\ninst\u271d\u00b2 : Module \u211d V\u271d\nn\u271d : \u2115\nB1\u271d B2\u271d : Fin n\u271d \u2192 V\u271d\nhB1\u271d : sorryAx (Sort ?u.5590) true\nhB2\u271d : sorryAx (Sort ?u.5593) true\nx\u271d : Sort ?u.5055\nIsBasis : x\u271d\nV : Type u_1\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : AddCommGroup V\ninst\u271d : Module \u211d V\nn : \u2115\nB1 B2 : Fin n \u2192 V\nhB1 : sorryAx (Sort ?u.5590) true\nhB2 : sorryAx (Sort ?u.5593) true\n\u22a2 \u2203!

To do this, we need to know the base and the height of the triangle. In this setup, we can consider AB as the base of the triangle, which is a. The height of the triangle will be the perpendicular distance from point E to line AB.\n\nSince AE = a + b, and AE is a straight line extending from A, we can visualize point E as being directly \"above\" point C if we extend line AC to reach the length a + b. This means that E is vertically aligned with C, and thus the height of triangle ABE is the same as the height of rectangle ABCD, which is b.\n\nThe area of a triangle is given by the formula \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}\\).

By multiplying both sides of the equation \\( A \\times v = w \\) by B, we get:\n\n\\[ B \\times (A \\times v) = B \\times w \\]\n\nUsing the associative property of matrix multiplication, this can be rewritten as:\n\n\\[ (B \\times A) \\times v = B \\times w \\]\n\nSince \\( B \\times A = I \\), we have:\n\n\\[ I \\times v = B \\times w \\]\n\nAnd because the identity matrix I leaves any vector unchanged, we have:\n\n\\[ v = B \\times w \\]\n\nThis shows that by applying the inverse matrix B to the vector w, we can recover the original vector v. Therefore, the transformation by matrix A can indeed be inverted, confirming that there exists a matrix B that transforms w back to v. This completes the proof that the transformation is invertible when the determinant of A is non-zero.\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  A.mulVec v\nargument\n  v\nhas type\n  Vector \u211d 2 : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  Fin 2 \u2192 \u211d : Type\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  A.mulVec v\nargument\n  v\nhas type\n  Vector \u211d 2 : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  Fin 2 \u2192 \u211d : Type\napplication type mismatch\n  A.mulVec B\nargument\n  B\nhas type\n  Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) \u211d : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  Fin 2 \u2192 \u211d : Type\nunknown identifier 'exists_mul_vec_eq_one_of_det_ne_zero'\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  ?M.mulVec (?N.mulVec ?v)\ncase h\ndet\u271d : ?m.2741\nA\u271d : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) \u211d\nv\u271d : Vector \u211d 2\nh\u271d : sorryAx \u2115 true \u2260 0\nx\u271d : Sort ?u.2740\ndet : x\u271d\nA : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) \u211d\nv : Vector \u211d 2\nh : sorryAx \u2115 true \u2260 0\nB : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) \u211d\nhB : A.mulVec (sorryAx (Fin 2 \u2192 \u211d) true) = 1\n\u22a2 sorryAx (Vector \u211d 2) true = v\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: invalid field notation, function 'Matrix.inv' does not have argument with type (Matrix ...) that can be used, it must be explicit or implicit with a unique name\nfailed to synthesize\n  Invertible A\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  Invertible A\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "# Informal Proof:\nTo determine whether the new teaching method has a statistically significant effect on the test scores, we need to perform a hypothesis test. Our null hypothesis (H0) is that the new teaching method has no effect, meaning the mean score of the students should still be 80, the same as the general population. The alternative hypothesis (H1) is that the new teaching method has a positive effect, meaning the mean score is greater than 80.\n\nWe are given that the mean score of the general population is 80 with a standard deviation of 10. The teacher's class of 30 students has a mean score of 85. We want to see if this observed mean of 85 is significantly higher than 80, given the sample size of 30 students.\n\nTo do this, we use a t-test for the sample mean. First, we calculate the standard error of the mean (SEM), which is the standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size. So, SEM = 10 / \u221a30 \u2248 1.83.\n\nNext, we calculate the t-statistic, which measures how many standard errors the sample mean is away from the population mean. The formula for the t-statistic is:\n\nt = (sample mean - population mean) / SEM\nt = (85 - 80) / 1.83 \u2248 2.73\n\nNow, we need to compare this t-statistic to the critical t-value from the t-distribution table for 29 degrees of freedom (since degrees of freedom = sample size - 1) at a significance level of 0.05. For a one-tailed test at the 0.05 significance level, the critical t-value is approximately 1.699.\n\nSince our calculated t-statistic of 2.73 is greater than the critical t-value of 1.699, we have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis. This means that the observed mean score of 85 is significantly higher than the population mean of 80, suggesting that the new teaching method has a positive effect on the students' test scores.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'let'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unsolved goals\npopulation_mean : \u2115 := 80\nsample_mean : \u2115 := 85\nstd_dev : \u2115 := 10\nsample_size : \u2115 := 30\nsignificance_level : Float := 5e-2\ndegrees_of_freedom : \u2115 := sample_size - 1\nstandard_error_of_mean : \u211d := \u2191std_dev / \u221a\u2191sample_size\nt_statistic : \u211d := (\u2191sample_mean - \u2191population_mean) / standard_error_of_mean\ncritical_t_value : Float := 1.699\nh1 : standard_error_of_mean = 10 / \u221a30\nh2 : t_statistic = (85 - 80) / (10 / \u221a30)\n\u22a2 t_statistic = 273 / 100\nunsolved goals\npopulation_mean : \u2115 := 80\nsample_mean : \u2115 := 85\nstd_dev : \u2115 := 10\nsample_size : \u2115 := 30\nsignificance_level : Float := 5e-2\ndegrees_of_freedom : \u2115 := sample_size - 1\nstandard_error_of_mean : \u211d := \u2191std_dev / \u221a\u2191sample_size\nt_statistic : \u211d := (\u2191sample_mean - \u2191population_mean) / standard_error_of_mean\ncritical_t_value : Float := 1.699\nh1 : standard_error_of_mean = 10 / \u221a30\nh2 : t_statistic = (85 - 80) / (10 / \u221a30)\nh3 : t_statistic = 2.73\nh4 : critical_t_value = 1.699\n\u22a2 1.699 < 2.73\ntype mismatch\n  h5\nhas type\n  2.73 > 1.699 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  let population_mean := 80;\n  let sample_mean := 85;\n  let std_dev := 10;\n  let sample_size := 30;\n  let significance_level := 5e-2;\n  let degrees_of_freedom := sample_size - 1;\n  let standard_error_of_mean := std_dev / \u221asample_size;\n  let t_statistic := (sample_mean - population_mean) / standard_error_of_mean;\n  let critical_t_value := 1.699;\n  t_statistic > critical_t_value : Prop\nPlease revise the proof.",

In mathematical terms, this is expressed as:\n\n\\[\n\\int_a^c f(x) \\, dx \\leq A\n\\]\n\nLet's break this down. The integral \\(\\int_a^c f(x) \\, dx\\) represents the area under the curve from \\( x = a \\) to \\( x = c \\). Since \\( c \\) is somewhere between \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), this area is just a part of the total area under the curve from \\( x = a \\) to \\( x = b \\).\n\nThe key point here is that the area from \\( x = a \\) to \\( x = c \\) is a subset of the area from \\( x = a \\) to \\( x = b \\). Since \\( f(x) \\) is non-negative, the area cannot decrease as we move from left to right along the x-axis. Therefore, the area from \\( x = a \\) to \\( x = c \\) must be less than or equal to the total area from \\( x = a \\) to \\( x = b \\).\n\nTo put it another way, if you imagine starting at \\( x = a \\) and moving towards \\( x = b \\), the area under the curve accumulates. When you stop at any point \\( c \\) before reaching \\( b \\), you have only accumulated part of the total area \\( A \\). Thus, the area up to \\( c \\) cannot exceed the total area \\( A \\).\n\nTherefore, for any \\( c \\) in the interval \\([a, b]\\), the area under the curve from \\( x = a \\) to \\( x = c \\) is indeed less than or equal to the total area \\( A \\), which completes our proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: function expected at\n  Icc\nterm has type\n  ?m.386\nfunction expected at\n  Icc\nterm has type\n  ?m.386\nfunction expected at\n  Icc\nterm has type\n  ?m.386\nfunction expected at\n  Icc\nterm has type\n  x\u271d\nfunction expected at\n  Icc\nterm has type\n  x\u271d\nunknown identifier 'Icc_subset_Icc_right'\nunsolved goals\nx\u271d : Sort u_1\nIcc : x\u271d\nf : \u211d \u2192 \u211d\na b : \u211d\nhab : a \u2264 b\nhf : ContinuousOn f (sorryAx (Set \u211d) true)\nhnonneg : \u2200 x \u2208 ?m.3947 f a b hab hf x, f x \u2265 0\nA : \u211d\nhA : A = \u222b (x : \u211d) in a..b, f x\nc : \u211d\nhc : c \u2208 ?m.3946 f a b hab hf hnonneg A hA c\n\u22a2 \u222b (x : \u211d) in a..c, f x \u2264 A\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown namespace 'Set'\nexpected token\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown namespace 'Set'\nexpected token\nPlease revise the proof.",

The chain rule is a formula for computing the derivative of a composite function. If you have a function \\( g(u) \\) and another function \\( u(x) \\), then the derivative of the composite function \\( g(u(x)) \\) with respect to \\( x \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{dx} g(u(x)) = g'(u(x)) \\cdot u'(x)\n\\]\n\nIn our case, the function \\( f(x) = e^{2x} \\) can be seen as a composite function where \\( g(u) = e^u \\) and \\( u(x) = 2x \\). \n\nNow, let's apply the chain rule:\n\n1. **Differentiate \\( g(u) = e^u \\):** The derivative of \\( e^u \\) with respect to \\( u \\) is simply \\( e^u \\).

A cylinder with the same base radius \\( r \\) and height \\( h \\) as our cone has a volume that is easier to calculate. The volume of a cylinder is the area of its circular base multiplied by its height. The area of the base is \\( \\pi r^2 \\), so the volume of the cylinder is \\( \\pi r^2 h \\).\n\nNow, imagine a cone and a cylinder with the same base and height. If we fill the cone with water and pour it into the cylinder, we notice that it takes exactly three full cones of water to fill the cylinder completely. This observation suggests that the cone's volume is one-third of the cylinder's volume.\n\nTo see why this is the case, consider slicing both the cone and the cylinder horizontally at various heights. At any given height, the cross-section of the cylinder is a circle with the same radius \\( r \\). However, the cross-section of the cone is a smaller circle, whose radius decreases linearly from \\( r \\) at the base to 0 at the tip.\n\nThis linear decrease in radius means that the area of each cross-section of the cone is smaller than that of the cylinder by a factor that depends on the height. Specifically, at a height \\( x \\) from the base, the radius of the cone's cross-section is \\( \\frac{r}{h} \\times x \\). The area of this cross-section is \\( \\pi \\left(\\frac{r}{h} \\times x\\right)^2 \\).\n\nIf we integrate these cross-sectional areas from the base to the tip of the cone, we effectively sum up all these infinitesimally thin slices to find the total volume. This integration process, which is a bit more formal, confirms that the volume of the cone is indeed one-third of the volume of the cylinder.\n\nThus, the volume of the cone is \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) of the volume of the cylinder, which is \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2 h \\).

The graph of \\( y = |z|^2 \\) is a collection of such parabolas, each corresponding to a different value of \\( y \\).\n\nIn summary, the graph of \\( y = |z|^2 \\) is a parabola because the equation \\( b^2 = y - a^2 \\) describes a parabolic relationship between \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) for each fixed \\( y \\). This is a classic example of how the geometry of complex numbers can be visualized in terms of familiar shapes like parabolas.",

        "informal_proof": "# Informal Proof:\n\nTo understand how a linear transformation affects a line in the plane, let's start by considering what a line in \u211d\u00b2 looks like. A line can be described by the equation ax + by + c = 0, where a, b, and c are constants, and (x, y) are the coordinates of any point on the line.\n\nNow, we have a linear transformation T defined by T(x) = Ax, where A is a 2x2 matrix. This transformation takes any point (x, y) in \u211d\u00b2 and maps it to a new point (x', y') in \u211d\u00b2. Our goal is to show that the image of the line under this transformation is still a line.\n\nLet's break this down step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Transformation**: The matrix A transforms a point (x, y) to a new point (x', y') = (a11x + a12y, a21x + a22y), where a11, a12, a21, and a22 are the elements of the matrix A. This transformation is linear, meaning it preserves operations like addition and scalar multiplication.\n\n2. **Substituting into the Line Equation**: We want to see what happens to the line equation ax + by + c = 0 under this transformation. For a point (x, y) on the line, we have ax + by + c = 0. After applying the transformation, the point becomes (x', y') = (a11x + a12y, a21x + a22y).\n\n3. **Expressing the New Line**: We need to express the condition for (x', y') to lie on the transformed line. Since T is linear, the transformation of the line can be described by a new equation in terms of x' and y'. The key is that linear transformations map lines to lines, which can be shown by considering the form of the transformation.\n\n4. **Formulating the New Equation**: The transformation essentially changes the coefficients of the line equation. The new line can be described by a linear combination of x' and y', which is still a linear equation. Specifically, the transformation can be seen as a change of variables, where the new variables (x', y') are linear combinations of the old ones (x, y).\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since the transformation T is linear, it maps the original line ax + by + c = 0 to another line in the plane. The new line is described by a linear equation in terms of x' and y', which is a result of the linearity of the transformation. Therefore, the image of the line under the transformation T is indeed a line.\n\nIn summary, because linear transformations preserve the linearity of equations, the image of a line under a linear transformation is always another line. This is a fundamental property of linear transformations in vector spaces.\nPrevious attempt failed with: expected token\nexpected token\nexpected token\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: expected token\nexpected token\nexpected token\nexpected token\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: expected token\nexpected token\nexpected token\nexpected token\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

When we do this, we are essentially combining the information from both equations to eliminate one of the variables. Here's how it works:\n\n- From equation 1, we have \\( x + y = 10 \\).\n- From equation 2, we have \\( x - y = 2 \\).\n\nNow, add these two equations:\n\n\\[\n(x + y) + (x - y) = 10 + 2\n\\]\n\nOn the left side, notice that the \\( +y \\) and \\(-y\\) cancel each other out, leaving us with:\n\n\\[\n2x = 12\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nx = 6\n\\]\n\nNow that we have found \\( x = 6 \\), we can substitute this value back into either of the original equations to find \\( y \\).

The derivative of \\( -2xy \\) with respect to \\( x \\) is \\( -2y \\).\n\n3. The third term is \\( y^2 \\).

We have 7.5, which can be thought of as 7 and a half, and 2.5, which is 2 and a half. One way to simplify this division is to eliminate the decimal by multiplying both numbers by the same factor. In this case, multiplying both 7.5 and 2.5 by 10 will convert them into whole numbers, making the division easier to handle.\n\nSo, multiply 7.5 by 10 to get 75, and multiply 2.5 by 10 to get 25. Now, instead of dividing 7.5 by 2.5, we can divide 75 by 25. \n\nNext, let's perform the division: 75 divided by 25. We can think of this as asking how many times 25 fits into 75. We know that 25 times 1 is 25, and 25 times 2 is 50. If we add another 25 to 50, we get 75. Therefore, 25 fits into 75 exactly 3 times.\n\nThus, 75 divided by 25 equals 3. Since we multiplied both the dividend (7.5) and the divisor (2.5) by the same number (10) to simplify the division, the result of the original division problem, 7.5 divided by 2.5, is the same as the result of 75 divided by 25.\n\nTherefore, the result of dividing 7.5 by 2.5 is 3.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

The Pythagorean theorem is a fundamental principle in geometry that applies to right triangles. It states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\n\nIn our triangle ABC, we know that BC and AC are the two legs of the triangle, and AB is the hypotenuse. We are given that BC = 4 and AC = 3. According to the Pythagorean theorem, we can express this relationship as:\n\nAB\u00b2 = BC\u00b2 + AC\u00b2.\n\nNow, let's substitute the known values into this equation:\n\nAB\u00b2 = 4\u00b2 + 3\u00b2.\n\nCalculating the squares of the lengths, we get:\n\n4\u00b2 = 16 and 3\u00b2 = 9.\n\nAdding these two results together gives us:\n\nAB\u00b2 = 16 + 9 = 25.\n\nTo find the length of AB, we need to take the square root of 25:\n\nAB = \u221a25.\n\nThe square root of 25 is 5, so:\n\nAB = 5.\n\nTherefore, the length of the hypotenuse AB is 5.

Let's start by understanding what it means for a triangle to be obtuse. A triangle is obtuse if one of its angles is greater than 90 degrees.\n\nIn triangle BPC, there are three angles to consider: angle BPC, angle PBC, and angle PCB. For the triangle to be obtuse, at least one of these angles must be greater than 90 degrees. However, due to the symmetry of the square and the random placement of point P, it is sufficient to focus on angle BPC being obtuse.\n\nNow, let's visualize the square ABCD with vertices A(0,0), B(2,0), C(2,2), and D(0,2) on a coordinate plane. Point P, being inside the square, can have coordinates (x, y) where 0 < x < 2 and 0 < y < 2.\n\nFor angle BPC to be obtuse, the dot product of vectors BP and CP must be negative. This is because the dot product of two vectors is negative when the angle between them is greater than 90 degrees. The vectors BP and CP can be expressed as:\n- BP = (x - 2, y)\n- CP = (x - 2, y - 2)\n\nThe dot product BP \u00b7 CP is calculated as:\nBP \u00b7 CP = (x - 2)(x - 2) + y(y - 2)\n\nSimplifying this expression gives:\nBP \u00b7 CP = (x - 2)^2 + y^2 - 2y\n\nFor the dot product to be negative, we need:\n(x - 2)^2 + y^2 - 2y < 0\n\nRearranging terms, we get:\n(x - 2)^2 < 2y - y^2\n\nThis inequality describes a region inside the square where point P must lie for triangle BPC to be obtuse. The region is bounded by a curve that is symmetric with respect to the line y = 1 (the horizontal line through the center of the square).\n\nTo find the probability, we need to determine the area of this region and divide it by the total area of the square, which is 4 square units (since each side of the square is 2 units long).\n\nBy symmetry and geometric reasoning, it can be shown that the region where triangle BPC is obtuse occupies exactly one-quarter of the square. This is because the obtuse condition is symmetric about the line y = 1, and similar reasoning applies to the other triangles formed by choosing different pairs of vertices (e.g., triangle APD, triangle DPA, etc.).\n\nTherefore, the probability that triangle BPC is obtuse is 1/4.\n\nIn conclusion, the probability that triangle BPC is obtuse when point P is chosen uniformly at random inside square ABCD is 1/4.\nPrevious attempt failed with: invalid declaration name 'A', there is a section variable with the same name\ninvalid declaration name 'B', there is a section variable with the same name\ninvalid declaration name 'C', there is a section variable with the same name\ninvalid declaration name 'D', there is a section variable with the same name\nunknown constant 'Set.measurability'\nunknown constant 'Set.measurability'\nunknown constant 'Set.measurability'\nunknown constant 'Set.measurability'\nunknown constant 'Set.measurability'\nunknown constant 'Set.measurability'\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  dot_product BP\nargument\n  BP\nhas type\n  \u211d \u00d7 \u211d \u2192 \u211d \u00d7 \u211d : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u211d \u00d7 \u211d : Type\ntype of theorem 'probability_obtuse_BPC' is not a proposition\n  \u211d\nunknown constant 'probability_obtuse_BPC'\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: type of theorem 'probability_obtuse_BPC' is not a proposition\n  \u211d\nunknown identifier 'begin'\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

This can be thought of as 2 hours and an additional 0.5 hours. \n\nNext, consider the time he spent playing video games, which is 1.75 hours. This can be broken down into 1 hour and an additional 0.75 hours.\n\nNow, we add these times together. Start by adding the whole hours: 2 hours (from basketball) plus 1 hour (from video games) gives us 3 hours.\n\nNext, we add the fractional hours: 0.5 hours (from basketball) plus 0.75 hours (from video games). To add these, it's helpful to think of them in terms of quarters of an hour. \n\n- 0.5 hours is equivalent to 2 quarters of an hour (since 0.5 is the same as 2/4).\n- 0.75 hours is equivalent to 3 quarters of an hour (since 0.75 is the same as 3/4).\n\nAdding these together, 2 quarters plus 3 quarters equals 5 quarters. \n\nSince 4 quarters make a whole hour, 5 quarters is equivalent to 1 whole hour and 1 additional quarter of an hour (because 5 quarters is 4 quarters plus 1 quarter).\n\nSo, the fractional hours add up to 1 hour and 0.25 hours.\n\nFinally, we combine the whole hours and the additional fractional hour: \n\n- We already have 3 whole hours from adding the whole hours.\n- Adding the 1 whole hour from the fractional part gives us 4 hours.\n- And we still have the 0.25 hours left over.\n\nTherefore, the total time Jack spent on his activities is 4 hours and 0.25 hours, which is 4.25 hours.\n\nIn conclusion, Jack spent a total of 4.25 hours on his activities on Sunday.",

In other words, an even integer \"a\" can be written as \\( a = 2k \\), where \"k\" is some integer. This means that when you divide \"a\" by 2, there is no remainder.\n\nOn the other hand, an integer is odd if it can be expressed as one more than twice another integer. So, an odd integer \"b\" can be written as \\( b = 2m + 1 \\), where \"m\" is some integer. This means that when you divide \"b\" by 2, there is a remainder of 1.\n\nNow, let's consider the sum of \"a\" and \"b\". We have:\n\\[ a + b = (2k) + (2m + 1) \\]\n\nWe can rearrange and combine the terms:\n\\[ a + b = 2k + 2m + 1 \\]\n\nNotice that \\( 2k + 2m \\) can be factored as:\n\\[ 2k + 2m = 2(k + m) \\]\n\nThis expression, \\( 2(k + m) \\), is clearly even because it is two times the integer \\( (k + m) \\).\n\nNow, let's add the remaining 1 to this even number:\n\\[ a + b = 2(k + m) + 1 \\]\n\nThis expression, \\( 2(k + m) + 1 \\), is exactly the form of an odd number: it is one more than an even number. Therefore, the sum \\( a + b \\) is odd.\n\nIn summary, when you add an even number (which is a multiple of 2) to an odd number (which is one more than a multiple of 2), the result is always odd. This is because the even part contributes a complete multiple of 2, and the odd part adds an extra 1, making the total one more than a multiple of 2, which is the definition of an odd number.

        "informal_proof": "# Informal Proof:\nTo understand why multiplying any number by 1 results in the number itself, let's think about what multiplication by 1 means. Multiplication is essentially repeated addition. For example, multiplying a number by 2 means adding that number to itself once (e.g., 3 times 2 is 3 + 3). \n\nNow, when we multiply a number by 1, we are essentially saying we want one group of that number. In other words, we are not adding the number to itself at all; we are just taking it as it is. For instance, if we have the number 5 and we multiply it by 1, we are simply taking one group of 5, which is just 5 itself. \n\nThis idea can be applied to any number, whether it's a whole number, a fraction, or even a negative number. If you take any number, say \\( x \\), and multiply it by 1, you are just taking one group of \\( x \\), which is \\( x \\) itself. \n\nAnother way to think about this is through the identity property of multiplication. The identity property states that there is a special number, called the multiplicative identity, which when multiplied by any number, leaves the number unchanged. In our number system, this special number is 1. So, multiplying any number by 1 will always give you the original number back, because 1 is the identity element for multiplication.\n\nTherefore, no matter what number you start with, multiplying it by 1 will always result in the number itself.

The limits for \\( \\theta \\) are from 0 to \\( 2\\pi \\), covering a full rotation around the z-axis.\n\nThe triple integral to calculate the volume \\( V \\) of the sphere is:\n\n\\[ V = \\int_{0}^{R} \\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} r^2 \\sin(\\phi) \\, d\\theta \\, d\\phi \\, dr. \\]\n\nLet's break down the integration process:\n\n1. **Integrate with respect to \\( \\theta \\):** Since the integrand \\( r^2 \\sin(\\phi) \\) does not depend on \\( \\theta \\), the integral with respect to \\( \\theta \\) is straightforward. The integral of 1 with respect to \\( \\theta \\) from 0 to \\( 2\\pi \\) is simply \\( 2\\pi \\).\n\n2. **Integrate with respect to \\( \\phi \\):** The next step is to integrate \\( r^2 \\sin(\\phi) \\) with respect to \\( \\phi \\). The integral of \\( \\sin(\\phi) \\) from 0 to \\( \\pi \\) is 2, because the integral of \\( \\sin(\\phi) \\) over this range is the area under one full sine wave from 0 to \\( \\pi \\).\n\n3. **Integrate with respect to \\( r \\):** Finally, we integrate \\( r^2 \\) with respect to \\( r \\) from 0 to \\( R \\). The integral of \\( r^2 \\) is \\( \\frac{r^3}{3} \\), and evaluating this from 0 to \\( R \\) gives \\( \\frac{R^3}{3} \\).\n\nPutting it all together, the volume \\( V \\) of the sphere is:\n\n\\[ V = 2\\pi \\times 2 \\times \\frac{R^3}{3} = \\frac{4\\pi R^3}{3}. \\]\n\nThus, we have shown that the volume of a sphere with radius \\( R \\) is \\( \\frac{4}{3} \\pi R^3 \\), which matches the well-known formula for the volume of a sphere. This demonstrates how the triple integral in spherical coordinates effectively captures the volume of the sphere.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unexpected token '\u03c6'; expected ')'\nunexpected token '\u03c6'; expected '_' or identifier\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unexpected token '\u03c6'; expected ')'\nunexpected token '\u03c6'; expected '_' or identifier\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unexpected token '\u03c6'; expected ')'\nunexpected token '\u03c6'; expected '_' or identifier\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

This theorem is a fundamental principle in geometry that applies specifically to right triangles, which are triangles with one 90-degree angle.\n\nImagine a right triangle where the two shorter sides, known as the legs, are labeled \\( a \\) and \\( b \\). The longest side, opposite the right angle, is called the hypotenuse and is labeled \\( c \\).\n\nThe Pythagorean Theorem states that in any right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (\\( c^2 \\)) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (\\( a^2 \\) and \\( b^2 \\)). Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n\n\\[ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 \\]\n\nThis relationship can be visualized by considering squares constructed on each side of the triangle. If you draw a square on each side of the triangle, the area of the square on the hypotenuse will be equal to the combined areas of the squares on the other two sides. This geometric interpretation helps us see why the theorem holds true.\n\nTo find the length of the hypotenuse \\( c \\), we need to solve for \\( c \\) in the equation \\( c^2 = a^2 + b^2 \\). To do this, we take the square root of both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ c = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \\]\n\nThis equation tells us that the length of the hypotenuse is the square root of the sum of the squares of the lengths of the two legs. This result is consistent with the Pythagorean Theorem and provides a straightforward way to calculate the hypotenuse when the lengths of the legs are known.\n\nIn summary, the Pythagorean Theorem provides a reliable method for determining the length of the hypotenuse in a right triangle, confirming that \\( c = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \\). This relationship is a cornerstone of geometry and is widely used in various applications, from construction to navigation, wherever right triangles are involved.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

The possible outcomes for these two balls can be combinations of red, blue, and green balls.

The sequence starts with the number 1, and each subsequent number is 5 more than the previous one. This type of sequence is known as an arithmetic sequence, where each term increases by a constant difference, which in this case is 5.\n\nLet's break down the sequence step by step:\n\n1. The first number in the sequence is given as 1.\n2. The second number is 5 more than the first number, so it is \\(1 + 5 = 6\\).\n3. The third number is 5 more than the second number, so it is \\(6 + 5 = 11\\).\n4. The fourth number is 5 more than the third number, so it is \\(11 + 5 = 16\\).\n\nWe can see a pattern forming here. Each number is obtained by adding 5 to the previous number. \n\nTo find the 20th number in this sequence, we can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence, which is:\n\n\\[ a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \\cdot d \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( a_n \\) is the nth term we want to find,\n- \\( a_1 \\) is the first term of the sequence,\n- \\( n \\) is the term number,\n- \\( d \\) is the common difference between the terms.\n\nIn our sequence:\n- The first term \\( a_1 \\) is 1.\n- The common difference \\( d \\) is 5.\n- We want to find the 20th term, so \\( n = 20 \\).\n\nPlugging these values into the formula gives us:\n\n\\[ a_{20} = 1 + (20-1) \\cdot 5 \\]\n\nFirst, calculate \\( (20-1) \\), which is 19.

The number of ways to choose 2 aces from these 4 is given by \"4 choose 2,\" which is calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2 \\times 1} = 6\n\\]\n\nThus, there are 6 favorable outcomes where both cards drawn are aces.\n\nNow, the probability that both cards drawn are aces is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes.

A function is differentiable on an interval if it has a derivative at every point in that interval. The derivative, \\( f'(x) \\), gives us the rate at which the function \\( f(x) \\) is changing at any point \\( x \\).\n\nIn this problem, we are given that \\( f'(x) = 0 \\) for all \\( x \\) in the interval \\( (a, b) \\). This means that at every point in this interval, the rate of change of the function is zero. In simpler terms, the function is not increasing or decreasing at any point within this interval.\n\nTo visualize this, imagine the graph of the function \\( f(x) \\). If the derivative is zero everywhere on \\( (a, b) \\), the graph must be a flat, horizontal line over this interval. This is because a zero derivative indicates no slope, and a line with no slope is horizontal.\n\nNow, let's consider what it means for a function to be constant. A constant function is one where the output value does not change regardless of the input. In other words, for a constant function, \\( f(x) = c \\) for some constant \\( c \\) and for all \\( x \\) in the interval.\n\nSince the derivative \\( f'(x) = 0 \\) implies that the function does not change its value as \\( x \\) changes, the only way this can happen is if the function is indeed constant.

In this context, a transformation typically refers to the action of a matrix on a vector, which is achieved through matrix multiplication. For a 2x2 matrix, this means taking a vector in 2-dimensional space and transforming it into another vector in the same space.\n\nNow, let's consider two 2x2 matrices, A and B. We want to show that if we first add these matrices together and then apply the resulting matrix as a transformation, it is the same as applying each matrix as a transformation separately and then adding the results.\n\nLet's break this down step by step:\n\n1. **Matrix Addition**: When we add two matrices A and B, we simply add their corresponding elements. So, if A = \\(\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix}\\) and B = \\(\\begin{pmatrix} e & f \\\\ g & h \\end{pmatrix}\\), then their sum, A + B, is \\(\\begin{pmatrix} a+e & b+f \\\\ c+g & d+h \\end{pmatrix}\\).\n\n2. **Transformation by a Matrix**: When a matrix acts on a vector, say \\(\\mathbf{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix}\\), it transforms it into another vector. For matrix A, this transformation is A\\(\\mathbf{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} ax + by \\\\ cx + dy \\end{pmatrix}\\). Similarly, for matrix B, the transformation is B\\(\\mathbf{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} ex + fy \\\\ gx + hy \\end{pmatrix}\\).\n\n3. **Transformation of the Sum**: Now, consider the transformation by the sum of the matrices, (A + B)\\(\\mathbf{v}\\). This is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   (A + B)\\mathbf{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} (a+e)x + (b+f)y \\\\ (c+g)x + (d+h)y \\end{pmatrix}\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{pmatrix} ax + ex + by + fy \\\\ cx + gx + dy + hy \\end{pmatrix}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Sum of the Transformations**: Next, consider the sum of the transformations by A and B separately:\n   - A\\(\\mathbf{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} ax + by \\\\ cx + dy \\end{pmatrix}\\)\n   - B\\(\\mathbf{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} ex + fy \\\\ gx + hy \\end{pmatrix}\\)\n\n   Adding these two results gives:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{pmatrix} ax + by \\\\ cx + dy \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} ex + fy \\\\ gx + hy \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} ax + ex + by + fy \\\\ cx + gx + dy + hy \\end{pmatrix}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Notice that the result of the transformation of the sum, (A + B)\\(\\mathbf{v}\\), is exactly the same as the sum of the transformations, A\\(\\mathbf{v}\\) + B\\(\\mathbf{v}\\).

Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, identify the key components of the problem. We have a set of assumptions or premises, and we need to derive a conclusion from these premises. The premises are usually given in the form of mathematical statements or conditions, and our goal is to show that these lead to the conclusion logically.\n\nNext, consider each premise and how it contributes to the overall argument. Often, premises can be combined or manipulated using known mathematical rules or theorems. For example, if we have a premise that involves an equation or inequality, we might use algebraic manipulation to simplify or transform it into a more useful form.\n\nAs we work through the problem, it's important to keep track of any logical deductions we make. Each step should follow logically from the previous one, ensuring that we don't make any unwarranted assumptions or leaps in reasoning.\n\nFinally, once we've connected all the premises to the conclusion, we should review the entire argument to ensure that it is coherent and complete.

We need to determine how much pizza she has left after eating some and sharing some with her friend.\n\nFirst, Sally eats 1/4 of the pizza she has. Since she originally has 1/2 of a pizza, we need to find out what 1/4 of 1/2 is. To do this, we multiply 1/4 by 1/2:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{8} \\]\n\nThis means Sally eats 1/8 of a whole pizza.\n\nNext, Sally shares 1/10 of the whole pizza with her friend. This is straightforward because she gives away 1/10 of the entire pizza, not just 1/10 of what she has.\n\nNow, let's calculate how much pizza Sally has left. Initially, she had 1/2 of a pizza. She ate 1/8 of a pizza and shared 1/10 of a pizza. We need to subtract both of these amounts from her initial 1/2 of a pizza.\n\nFirst, convert 1/2 to a common denominator with 1/8 and 1/10. The least common multiple of 2, 8, and 10 is 40. So, we convert each fraction:\n\n- 1/2 of a pizza is equivalent to 20/40.\n- 1/8 of a pizza is equivalent to 5/40.\n- 1/10 of a pizza is equivalent to 4/40.\n\nNow, subtract the amounts Sally ate and shared from what she initially had:\n\n\\[ \\frac{20}{40} - \\frac{5}{40} - \\frac{4}{40} = \\frac{20 - 5 - 4}{40} = \\frac{11}{40} \\]\n\nTherefore, after eating and sharing, Sally has 11/40 of the pizza left.",

When we say that a function \\( f \\) is integrable over an interval \\([a, b]\\), we mean that we can compute the definite integral of \\( f \\) over this interval. This involves summing up infinitely many infinitesimally small products of the function's values and the widths of subintervals that partition \\([a, b]\\). The result of this process is a single number, which represents the \"net area\" under the curve of the function from \\( a \\) to \\( b \\).\n\nNow, let's consider the nature of the function \\( f \\). The function \\( f \\) maps elements from a vector space \\( V \\) to the real numbers \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). This means that for each input from the vector space \\( V \\), the function \\( f \\) assigns a real number. The vector space \\( V \\) itself is not directly involved in the integration process; rather, it is the real-valued outputs of \\( f \\) that are integrated over the interval \\([a, b]\\).\n\nThe integral of \\( f \\) over \\([a, b]\\) is computed by considering the values \\( f(x) \\) for \\( x \\) in \\([a, b]\\). Since each \\( f(x) \\) is a real number, the integration process involves summing real numbers. The result of this summation, the definite integral, is a real number because it is the limit of sums of real numbers. Therefore, the integral of \\( f \\) over \\([a, b]\\) is a scalar in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\).\n\nIn summary, the key points are:\n1. The function \\( f \\) maps elements from a vector space \\( V \\) to real numbers.\n2. The integration process involves summing real numbers over the interval \\([a, b]\\).\n3. The result of this integration is a single real number, which is a scalar in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\).\n\nThus, we conclude that the integral of the function \\( f \\) over the interval \\([a, b]\\) is indeed a scalar in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: expected token\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: expected token\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: expected token\nPlease revise the proof.",

Linear functions are among the simplest types of functions because they have a constant rate of change. In this case, the rate of change is 3, which is the coefficient of \\( x \\). This means that for every 1 unit increase in \\( x \\), the value of \\( f(x) \\) increases by 3 units.\n\nNow, when we talk about the limit of \\( f(x) \\) as \\( x \\) approaches 4, we are interested in what value \\( f(x) \\) gets closer to as \\( x \\) gets closer and closer to 4. We are not necessarily concerned with the value of \\( f(x) \\) exactly at \\( x = 4 \\), but rather what happens as \\( x \\) gets very close to 4 from either side (from values slightly less than 4 and slightly more than 4).\n\nLet's calculate \\( f(x) \\) when \\( x \\) is exactly 4: \n\\[ f(4) = 3(4) + 2 = 12 + 2 = 14. \\]\n\nThis calculation shows that when \\( x \\) is exactly 4, \\( f(x) \\) is 14. But more importantly, because \\( f(x) = 3x + 2 \\) is a continuous function (meaning there are no jumps, breaks, or holes in the graph), the value of \\( f(x) \\) as \\( x \\) approaches 4 from either side will also approach 14. \n\nTo see this, consider values of \\( x \\) that are very close to 4, such as 3.9, 3.99, 4.01, and 4.1. For each of these values, we can calculate \\( f(x) \\):\n\n- If \\( x = 3.9 \\), then \\( f(3.9) = 3(3.9) + 2 = 11.7 + 2 = 13.7 \\).\n- If \\( x = 3.99 \\), then \\( f(3.99) = 3(3.99) + 2 = 11.97 + 2 = 13.97 \\).\n- If \\( x = 4.01 \\), then \\( f(4.01) = 3(4.01) + 2 = 12.03 + 2 = 14.03 \\).\n- If \\( x = 4.1 \\), then \\( f(4.1) = 3(4.1) + 2 = 12.3 + 2 = 14.3 \\).\n\nAs you can see, as \\( x \\) gets closer to 4, the value of \\( f(x) \\) gets closer to 14. This pattern holds true for any value of \\( x \\) that is near 4, whether it is slightly less than 4 or slightly more than 4.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the limit of \\( f(x) = 3x + 2 \\) as \\( x \\) approaches 4 is indeed 14. This is because the function is continuous and the value of the function at \\( x = 4 \\) is 14, and the values of the function near \\( x = 4 \\) approach 14 as well.\nPrevious attempt failed with: function expected at\n  Tendsto\nterm has type\n  ?m.3\ninvalid field notation, type is not of the form (C ...) where C is a constant\n  Tendsto\nhas type\n  x\u271d\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: function expected at\n  Tendsto\nterm has type\n  ?m.3\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: function expected at\n  Tendsto\nterm has type\n  ?m.3\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

When we divide 20 apples by 5 friends, we are essentially asking how many apples each friend would receive if the apples were shared equally. \n\nTo find this, we perform the division: 20 divided by 5. We can think of this as asking how many groups of 5 apples can be made from 20 apples. If we start grouping the apples, we can make one group of 5 apples, then another group of 5 apples, and continue this process. After making 4 such groups, we will have used up all 20 apples (since 5 apples per group times 4 groups equals 20 apples).\n\nTherefore, each group contains 5 apples, and since each group represents the share for one friend, each friend will receive 4 apples. \n\nThus, when Tom distributes the 20 apples equally among his 5 friends, each friend gets 4 apples.\nPrevious attempt failed with: no goals to be solved\nPlease revise the proof.",

In this case, we are looking for the integral of \\( 2x \\) from \\( x = 0 \\) to \\( x = 3 \\).\n\nThe function \\( f(x) = 2x \\) is a simple linear function, which means its graph is a straight line.

This line increases steadily as \\( x \\) increases.\n\nTo integrate \\( 2x \\), we need to find its antiderivative. The antiderivative of \\( 2x \\) is a function whose derivative is \\( 2x \\). A basic rule of integration tells us that the antiderivative of \\( x^n \\) is \\( \\frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} \\), provided \\( n \\neq -1 \\).

The formula for the volume of a cube is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Volume} = \\text{side length}^3 \\]\n\nIn this case, the side length of John's cube is 5 cm. So, we calculate the volume as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Volume} = 5 \\, \\text{cm} \\times 5 \\, \\text{cm} \\times 5 \\, \\text{cm} = 125 \\, \\text{cm}^3 \\]\n\nNow that we have the volume, we can use the density to find the mass. The density of the substance making up the cube is given as 2 g/cm\u00b3. This means that every cubic centimeter of the substance has a mass of 2 grams.\n\nUsing the formula for mass:\n\n\\[ \\text{Mass} = \\text{Density} \\times \\text{Volume} = 2 \\, \\text{g/cm}^3 \\times 125 \\, \\text{cm}^3 \\]\n\nWhen we multiply these values, the cubic centimeters (cm\u00b3) cancel out, leaving us with grams (g):\n\n\\[ \\text{Mass} = 250 \\, \\text{g} \\]\n\nTherefore, the mass of the cube is 250 grams. This result makes sense because we have a cube with a substantial volume (125 cm\u00b3) and a moderate density (2 g/cm\u00b3), leading to a total mass of 250 grams.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'calc'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'calc'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

An integer is even if it can be expressed as \\( 2k \\), where \\( k \\) is some integer. This definition captures the essence of even numbers: they are multiples of 2.\n\nNow, let's assume that \\( a \\) is an even integer. By the definition of even numbers, we can write \\( a = 2k \\) for some integer \\( k \\).\n\nNext, we need to consider what happens when we square \\( a \\). So, let's calculate \\( a^2 \\):\n\n\\[\na^2 = (2k)^2\n\\]\n\nWhen we square \\( 2k \\), we apply the rule of exponents that says \\((xy)^2 = x^2y^2\\).

In our expression A' = (xk)B, we see that A' is indeed B multiplied by the product xk.\n\nThe crux of the matter lies in the nature of xk.

Therefore, the number of boys is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of boys} = 3 \\times \\frac{x}{5} = \\frac{3x}{5} \\]\n\nSimilarly, there are 2 parts that represent girls, so the number of girls in the classroom is 2 times the size of one part. Therefore, the number of girls is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of girls} = 2 \\times \\frac{x}{5} = \\frac{2x}{5} \\]\n\nTo verify, we can add the number of boys and girls to ensure it equals the total number of students:\n\n\\[ \\frac{3x}{5} + \\frac{2x}{5} = \\frac{3x + 2x}{5} = \\frac{5x}{5} = x \\]\n\nThis confirms that our expressions for the number of boys and girls are correct, as they sum up to the total number of students, \"x\".

The problem states that a car is traveling at a constant speed and covers 70 miles in 1 hour. This means the car's speed is 70 miles per hour (mph).\n\nWhen a car travels at a constant speed, the distance it covers is directly proportional to the time it travels. This means if the car continues to travel at the same speed, the distance it covers will increase linearly with time. \n\nIn this case, we want to find out how far the car will travel in 3 hours. Since the car travels 70 miles in 1 hour, we can calculate the distance for 3 hours by multiplying the distance covered in 1 hour by the number of hours:\n\nDistance in 3 hours = Speed \u00d7 Time\nDistance in 3 hours = 70 miles/hour \u00d7 3 hours\n\nBy performing the multiplication, we get:\n\nDistance in 3 hours = 210 miles\n\nTherefore, if the car continues to travel at the same constant speed of 70 miles per hour, it will cover a distance of 210 miles in 3 hours.

A vector space is a collection of objects called vectors, which can be added together and multiplied by scalars (real numbers, in this case) in a way that satisfies certain rules. These rules include properties like associativity, commutativity of addition, and distributivity of scalar multiplication over vector addition.\n\nNow, let's break down the expression \\( c \\cdot (a + b) \\). Here, \\( a + b \\) represents the sum of two vectors \\( a \\) and \\( b \\). According to the rules of vector addition in a vector space, this sum is another vector in the same space. \n\nNext, we apply the scalar \\( c \\) to the vector \\( a + b \\). Scalar multiplication in a vector space is defined such that multiplying a vector by a scalar results in another vector in the same space. The operation \\( c \\cdot (a + b) \\) means we are scaling the vector \\( a + b \\) by the factor \\( c \\).\n\nThe key property we use here is the distributive property of scalar multiplication over vector addition, which is one of the defining properties of a vector space. This property states that for any scalar \\( c \\) and any vectors \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), the scalar multiplication distributes over the addition of vectors. In other words, multiplying a sum of vectors by a scalar is the same as multiplying each vector by the scalar and then adding the results.\n\nTherefore, when we apply the scalar \\( c \\) to the sum \\( a + b \\), the distributive property tells us that this is equivalent to first applying \\( c \\) to \\( a \\) and \\( c \\) to \\( b \\) separately, and then adding the two results together. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n\n\\[ c \\cdot (a + b) = c \\cdot a + c \\cdot b. \\]\n\nThis equality holds for any vectors \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) in the vector space \\( V \\) and any real number \\( c \\), because it is a fundamental property of how vector spaces are structured. This property ensures that operations within the vector space behave in a consistent and predictable manner, allowing us to manipulate vectors and scalars with confidence.\n\nIn summary, the equation \\( c \\cdot (a + b) = c \\cdot a + c \\cdot b \\) is a direct consequence of the distributive property of scalar multiplication over vector addition, which is a core axiom of vector spaces. This property ensures that scalar multiplication interacts with vector addition in a way that is both intuitive and mathematically sound.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  HSMul \u211d (\u211d ^ 3) ?m.587\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  HPow Type \u2115 Type\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  HPow Type \u2115 Type\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nsimp made no progress\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  HSMul \u211d (\u211d ^ 3) ?m.587\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  HPow Type \u2115 Type\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  HPow Type \u2115 Type\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  HSMul \u211d (\u211d ^ 3) ?m.587\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  HPow Type \u2115 Type\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  HPow Type \u2115 Type\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

The sequence of odd numbers starts as 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and so on. The \\( n \\)-th odd number can be expressed as \\( 2n - 1 \\).\n\nNow, let's consider the sum of the first \\( n \\) odd numbers:\n\n\\[ 1 + 3 + 5 + \\ldots + (2n - 1) \\]\n\nWe want to show that this sum equals \\( n^2 \\).\n\nLet's use a simple example to see the pattern.

This pattern suggests that the sum of the first \\( n \\) odd numbers is indeed \\( n^2 \\).\n\nTo understand why this pattern holds, consider the following reasoning: \n\nEach time we add the next odd number, we are effectively adding a new layer to a square.

To do this, we need a common denominator. The denominators here are 4 and 3. The least common multiple (LCM) of 4 and 3 is 12.

In the second month, since the profit decreases by $200, the profit would be $1000 - $200 = $800.\n\nContinuing this pattern, in the third month, the profit would decrease by another $200, making it $800 - $200 = $600.

We have a function \\( f(x) \\) that is continuous and non-negative on the interval \\([a, b]\\). The integral of \\( f(x) \\) from \\( a \\) to \\( b \\) is given to be 1. This means that the total \"area\" under the curve of \\( f(x) \\) from \\( a \\) to \\( b \\) is exactly 1.\n\nNow, we want to show that for any point \\( c \\) within the interval \\([a, b]\\), the integral of \\( f(x) \\) from \\( a \\) to \\( c \\) is less than or equal to 1. In simpler terms, the area under the curve from \\( a \\) to any point \\( c \\) within the interval cannot exceed the total area from \\( a \\) to \\( b \\).\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding the Integral**: The integral of \\( f(x) \\) from \\( a \\) to \\( c \\), denoted as \\(\\int_a^c f(x) \\, dx\\), represents the area under the curve from \\( a \\) to \\( c \\). Since \\( c \\) is within the interval \\([a, b]\\), this area is a part of the total area from \\( a \\) to \\( b \\).\n\n2. **Non-Negativity of \\( f(x) \\)**: Since \\( f(x) \\) is non-negative, the area from \\( a \\) to \\( c \\) is non-decreasing as \\( c \\) moves from \\( a \\) to \\( b \\). This means that as you move from \\( a \\) to \\( b \\), the accumulated area under the curve can only stay the same or increase, but never decrease.\n\n3. **Total Area Constraint**: We know that the total area from \\( a \\) to \\( b \\) is exactly 1. Therefore, any partial area from \\( a \\) to \\( c \\) (where \\( c \\leq b \\)) must be less than or equal to this total area. If it were greater than 1, it would contradict the fact that the total area from \\( a \\) to \\( b \\) is 1.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since the area from \\( a \\) to \\( c \\) is part of the total area from \\( a \\) to \\( b \\), and since \\( f(x) \\) is non-negative, the integral from \\( a \\) to \\( c \\) cannot exceed the integral from \\( a \\) to \\( b \\). Therefore, \\(\\int_a^c f(x) \\, dx \\leq 1\\).\n\nIn summary, the non-negativity and continuity of \\( f(x) \\), along with the fact that the total integral from \\( a \\) to \\( b \\) is 1, ensure that the integral from \\( a \\) to any point \\( c \\) within \\([a, b]\\) is less than or equal to 1.

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's talk about the z-score. The z-score is a way of measuring how far away a particular score is from the average score, in terms of standard deviations. In this case, the average score (mean) is 85, and the standard deviation is 5. The formula for calculating the z-score is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{(X - \\mu)}{\\sigma} \\]\n\nwhere \\( X \\) is the score of the student, \\( \\mu \\) is the mean, and \\( \\sigma \\) is the standard deviation.\n\nIn this problem, the student scored 95. So, we plug the values into the formula:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{(95 - 85)}{5} \\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{10}{5} = 2 \\]\n\nSo, the z-score for a student who scored 95 is 2. This means the student's score is 2 standard deviations above the mean.\n\nNext, we need to find the cosine of this z-score. The cosine function is a trigonometric function that takes an angle as input and returns a value between -1 and 1. However, in this context, we are treating the z-score as an angle in radians. \n\nThe cosine of 2 radians can be found using a calculator or a trigonometric table. The value of \\(\\cos(2)\\) is approximately -0.416. \n\nTherefore, the cosine of the z-score, which is 2, is approximately -0.416.\n\nIn summary, the z-score of a student who scored 95 is 2, and the cosine of this z-score is approximately -0.416.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.cos', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to synthesize\n  HasEquiv \u211d\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'let'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.cos', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to synthesize\n  HasEquiv \u211d\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'let'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.cos', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to synthesize\n  HasEquiv \u211d\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'let'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

Therefore, the area of Rectangle A is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Area of Rectangle A} = \\text{length} \\times \\text{width} = 10 \\times 5 = 50 \\text{ square units}. \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the area of Rectangle B.

        "informal_proof": "# Informal Proof:\n\nTo understand why the sum of the residuals in a simple linear regression model is zero, let's first clarify what a residual is. For each observation in our dataset, the residual is the difference between the actual observed value (yi) and the predicted value (y\u0302i) given by the regression model. Mathematically, this is expressed as (yi - y\u0302i).\n\nIn a simple linear regression model, the predicted value y\u0302i for each xi is calculated using the equation y\u0302i = \u03b20 + \u03b21xi. The goal of linear regression is to find the best-fitting line through the data points, which is achieved by minimizing the sum of the squared residuals. This method is known as the \"least squares\" method.\n\nNow, let's consider the sum of the residuals across all observations. This sum is expressed as:\n\n\u2211(yi - y\u0302i) for i = 1 to 10.\n\nSubstituting the expression for y\u0302i, we have:\n\n\u2211(yi - (\u03b20 + \u03b21xi)) for i = 1 to 10.\n\nThis can be rewritten as:\n\n\u2211(yi - \u03b20 - \u03b21xi) for i = 1 to 10.\n\nWe can separate this into two sums:\n\n\u2211yi - \u2211(\u03b20 + \u03b21xi) for i = 1 to 10.\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\u2211yi - \u03b20\u22111 - \u03b21\u2211xi for i = 1 to 10.\n\nNotice that \u22111 is simply the number of observations, which is 10 in this case. So, the expression becomes:\n\n\u2211yi - 10\u03b20 - \u03b21\u2211xi.\n\nNow, here's the key point: when we perform linear regression using the least squares method, one of the conditions that the best-fitting line must satisfy is that the sum of the residuals is zero. This is because the least squares method ensures that the line passes through the \"center\" of the data in such a way that the positive and negative residuals balance each other out.\n\nMathematically, this condition is derived from the normal equations used to calculate the regression coefficients \u03b20 and \u03b21. Specifically, the normal equations ensure that:\n\n\u2211(yi - y\u0302i) = 0.\n\nThis is a fundamental property of the least squares regression line. Therefore, by the design of the least squares method, the sum of the residuals (yi - y\u0302i) for all observations is guaranteed to be zero.\n\nIn summary, the sum of the residuals is zero because the least squares method, which is used to determine the regression line, inherently balances the residuals around the line, ensuring that their total sum is zero. This is a built-in feature of the method that ensures the best possible fit to the data.\nPrevious attempt failed with: expected token\nfunction expected at\n  residual x\u271d\nterm has type\n  Filter x\u271d\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: 'residual' has already been declared\nfailed to synthesize\n  TopologicalSpace i\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  Fintype (Type ?u.821)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: 'residual' has already been declared\nfailed to synthesize\n  TopologicalSpace i\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  Fintype (Type ?u.821)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nPlease revise the proof.",

In any triangle, the sum of the interior angles is always 180 degrees. In a right triangle, one of these angles is always 90 degrees, which is the right angle. \n\nNow, let's apply this to our specific triangle. We are given that two of the angles in the triangle are 45 degrees each. Since the sum of the angles in any triangle must be 180 degrees, we can calculate the third angle as follows:\n\n- The sum of the two given angles is 45 degrees + 45 degrees = 90 degrees.\n- Since the total sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, the remaining angle must be 180 degrees - 90 degrees = 90 degrees.\n\nThis confirms that the triangle is indeed a right triangle, as it has a 90-degree angle. \n\nNext, let's consider the sides of this triangle. In a right triangle, the side opposite the right angle is called the hypotenuse, and the other two sides are called the legs. In our triangle, the two 45-degree angles are opposite the two legs. \n\nIn any triangle, angles opposite equal sides are equal. Since both angles are 45 degrees, the sides opposite these angles must be equal in length. Therefore, the two legs of the triangle are equal, making the triangle isosceles.\n\nThus, we have shown that a right triangle with two 45-degree angles has two equal sides, confirming that it is an isosceles triangle.",

This gives us:\n\n75 apples - 40 apples = 35 apples\n\nSo, after the squirrel takes its share, there are 35 apples remaining in the basket.\n\nNext, a bird comes and takes 50 apples from the basket. We need to subtract these 50 apples from the 35 apples that were left after the squirrel took its share. This calculation looks like this:\n\n35 apples - 50 apples = -15 apples\n\nNow, we have a result of -15 apples. In the context of this problem, having a negative number of apples doesn't make sense in a physical sense because you can't have a negative quantity of apples in a basket. Instead, this negative number indicates that the bird tried to take more apples than were actually available in the basket after the squirrel had already taken some.\n\nThe negative result of -15 means that the bird wanted to take 15 more apples than were actually present in the basket. In practical terms, this means that after the bird took all the remaining 35 apples, there were no apples left in the basket, and the bird couldn't take the additional 15 apples it wanted because they simply weren't there.\n\nTherefore, the number of apples left in the basket is 0, as the bird took all the remaining apples.

The problem involves two transformations applied to this square.\n\n1. **First Transformation (Enlargement):** The square is enlarged by 3 times. This means that each side of the square, originally `x` inches long, is now 3 times longer. So, after this transformation, the side length of the square becomes `3x` inches.\n\n2. **Second Transformation (Reduction):** Next, the square undergoes a reduction in size by half. This means that each side of the square, which is currently `3x` inches long, is reduced to half its length. So, after this transformation, the side length of the square becomes `(1/2) * 3x = (3/2)x` inches.\n\nNow, we are given that after these transformations, the final side length of the square is 6 inches. We need to find the original side length `x`.\n\nWe set up the equation based on the final side length:\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{2}x = 6\n\\]\n\nTo solve for `x`, we need to isolate `x` on one side of the equation. We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\), which is \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\):\n\n\\[\nx = 6 \\times \\frac{2}{3}\n\\]\n\nCalculating the right side, we get:\n\\[\nx = 6 \\times \\frac{2}{3} = 6 \\times \\frac{2}{3} = 12 \\times \\frac{1}{3} = 4\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the original side length `x` of the square is 4 inches.\n\nIn summary, by applying the transformations step by step and using the given final side length, we determined that the original side length of the square was 4 inches.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "# Informal Proof:\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to understand the relationship between the given mathematical statements and how they can be logically connected to reach the desired conclusion. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, identify the key components of the problem. We have a set of assumptions or premises, and we need to derive a conclusion from these. The assumptions might involve properties of numbers, sets, functions, or other mathematical objects, and the conclusion is typically a statement that follows logically from these assumptions.\n\nNext, consider each assumption and how it contributes to the overall argument. For example, if we have an assumption about a function being continuous, we might use this to argue about the behavior of the function at certain points or over certain intervals. Similarly, if we have an assumption about a number being positive, we might use this to infer something about its square or its reciprocal.\n\nAs we work through the problem, we should look for logical connections between the assumptions. This might involve using known theorems or properties, such as the transitive property of equality, the distributive property of multiplication over addition, or the fact that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. These connections help us build a chain of reasoning that leads from the assumptions to the conclusion.\n\nThroughout the process, it's important to keep track of what we know and what we are trying to prove. This helps us stay focused and avoid getting sidetracked by irrelevant details. It also helps us identify any gaps in our reasoning, which we can then address by revisiting the assumptions or considering additional properties or theorems.\n\nFinally, once we have a clear chain of reasoning, we can write out the proof in a clear and logical manner. This involves stating each step of the argument clearly and justifying it with reference to the assumptions or known theorems. By doing this, we ensure that the proof is both correct and easy to understand.\n\nIn summary, solving a mathematical problem involves understanding the assumptions, identifying logical connections, and constructing a clear and logical argument that leads to the desired conclusion. By following these steps, we can generate a clear and detailed informal proof that explains the mathematical reasoning behind the solution.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown constant 'Real.ArithmeticMeanGeometricMean'\nPlease revise the proof.",

The function \\( y = e^{mx} \\) is an exponential function where \\( m \\) is a constant.

This value is approximately \u00b12.069.\n\n   Since our calculated t-statistic (2.23) is greater than the critical value (2.069), we reject the null hypothesis.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   Since the calculated t-statistic exceeds the critical value, we have enough evidence to conclude that there is a statistically significant difference in the mean scores of the two groups at the 0.05 significance level.

The triangle is defined such that its hypotenuse is a diameter of the circle.\n\nFirst, let's visualize the setup. We have a circle with a radius of 1 unit, which means the diameter of the circle is 2 units. The right-angled isosceles triangle is inscribed in this circle, with its hypotenuse being the diameter. Since the triangle is isosceles and right-angled, the two legs of the triangle are equal in length.\n\nThe hypotenuse of the triangle, being a diameter of the circle, is 2 units long. In a right-angled isosceles triangle, the relationship between the hypotenuse (c) and the legs (a) is given by the Pythagorean theorem: \\(c = \\sqrt{2}a\\). Here, \\(c = 2\\), so we have:\n\n\\[ 2 = \\sqrt{2}a \\]\n\nSolving for \\(a\\), we get:\n\n\\[ a = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\sqrt{2} \\]\n\nThus, each leg of the triangle is \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) units long.\n\nNext, we calculate the area of the triangle.

The integral of a function over an interval can be thought of as the \"net area\" between the function and the x-axis over that interval. If this net area is zero, it suggests that the positive and negative areas (if any) cancel each other out perfectly.\n\nNow, let's consider the nature of the function \\( f \\). Since \\( f \\) is continuous on \\([a, b]\\), it means there are no jumps or breaks in the graph of \\( f \\). This continuity is crucial because it allows us to apply the Intermediate Value Theorem, which states that if a continuous function takes on two values, it must take on every value in between at some point.\n\nSuppose, for the sake of contradiction, that \\( f(x) \\) is never zero on \\([a, b]\\). This would mean that \\( f(x) \\) is either always positive or always negative throughout the interval. If \\( f(x) \\) were always positive, then the integral from \\( a \\) to \\( b \\) would be positive, because we would be summing up positive values over the interval. Similarly, if \\( f(x) \\) were always negative, the integral would be negative, as we would be summing up negative values. In either case, the integral could not be zero, which contradicts our given condition that the integral is zero.\n\nTherefore, the assumption that \\( f(x) \\) is never zero must be false. This means there must be at least one point \\( c \\) in \\([a, b]\\) where \\( f(c) = 0\\). This conclusion aligns with the idea that for the areas above and below the x-axis to perfectly cancel out to zero, the function must cross the x-axis at least once, which is where \\( f(c) = 0 \\).

This can be expressed mathematically as the equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{x}{5} = 10 \\]\n\nThe equation tells us that if we take \\( x \\) and divide it by 5, we end up with 10. To find \\( x \\), we need to reverse this operation. The operation that reverses division by 5 is multiplication by 5. So, if we multiply both sides of the equation by 5, we can isolate \\( x \\) on one side of the equation.\n\nLet's do that step-by-step:\n\n1. Start with the equation: \\(\\frac{x}{5} = 10\\).\n\n2. Multiply both sides of the equation by 5 to cancel out the division by 5 on the left side. This gives us:\n\n   \\[ 5 \\times \\frac{x}{5} = 5 \\times 10 \\]\n\n3. On the left side, multiplying by 5 and dividing by 5 are inverse operations, so they cancel each other out, leaving us with just \\( x \\):\n\n   \\[ x = 5 \\times 10 \\]\n\n4. Now, calculate the right side: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\).\n\nTherefore, the value of \\( x \\) is 50.\n\nIn summary, by reversing the division operation through multiplication, we determined that \\( x \\) must be 50 to satisfy the original condition that dividing \\( x \\) by 5 results in 10.\nPrevious attempt failed with: no goals to be solved\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: no goals to be solved\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: no goals to be solved\nPlease revise the proof.",

We will use hypothesis testing for this purpose, specifically a t-test, since we are dealing with sample means and standard deviations.\n\nFirst, let's consider the real parts of the complex numbers:\n\n1. **Population Mean of Real Parts**: 5\n2. **Sample Mean of Real Parts**: 4.8\n3. **Sample Standard Deviation of Real Parts**: 1\n4. **Sample Size**: 30\n\nWe will perform a t-test to see if the difference between the sample mean and the population mean is statistically significant. The null hypothesis (H0) is that the sample mean is equal to the population mean, i.e., there is no significant difference. The alternative hypothesis (H1) is that the sample mean is different from the population mean.\n\nThe formula for the t-statistic is:\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{\\bar{x} - \\mu}{s / \\sqrt{n}} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(\\bar{x}\\) is the sample mean,\n- \\(\\mu\\) is the population mean,\n- \\(s\\) is the sample standard deviation,\n- \\(n\\) is the sample size.\n\nPlugging in the values for the real parts:\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{4.8 - 5}{1 / \\sqrt{30}} = \\frac{-0.2}{1 / \\sqrt{30}} \\approx \\frac{-0.2}{0.1826} \\approx -1.095 \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the critical t-value for a two-tailed test at the 5% significance level with \\(n - 1 = 29\\) degrees of freedom. Looking up a t-distribution table, the critical t-value is approximately \u00b12.045.\n\nSince the calculated t-value of -1.095 is within the range of -2.045 to 2.045, we fail to reject the null hypothesis for the real parts. This means the sample mean of the real parts is not significantly different from the population mean at the 5% level.\n\nNow, let's consider the imaginary parts of the complex numbers:\n\n1. **Population Mean of Imaginary Parts**: 3\n2. **Sample Mean of Imaginary Parts**: 2.9\n3. **Sample Standard Deviation of Imaginary Parts**: 0.8\n4. **Sample Size**: 30\n\nUsing the same t-test approach:\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{2.9 - 3}{0.8 / \\sqrt{30}} = \\frac{-0.1}{0.8 / \\sqrt{30}} \\approx \\frac{-0.1}{0.146} \\approx -0.685 \\]\n\nAgain, comparing this t-value to the critical t-value of \u00b12.045, we see that -0.685 is also within the range. Therefore, we fail to reject the null hypothesis for the imaginary parts as well.\n\nIn conclusion, neither the real parts nor the imaginary parts of the sample are significantly different from the population at the 5% level of significance. Thus, the sample is not significantly different from the population.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  HSub Float \u2115 ?m.2386\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nunsolved goals\nreal_part_mean : \u2115 := 5\nreal_part_sample_mean : Float := 4.8\nreal_part_sample_stddev : \u2115 := 1\nreal_part_sample_size : \u2115 := 30\nimag_part_mean : \u2115 := 3\nimag_part_sample_mean : Float := 2.9\nimag_part_sample_stddev : Float := 0.8\nimag_part_sample_size : \u2115 := 30\n\u22a2 let real_part_mean := 5;\n  let real_part_sample_mean := 4.8;\n  let real_part_sample_stddev := 1;\n  let real_part_sample_size := 30;\n  let imag_part_mean := 3;\n  let imag_part_sample_mean := 2.9;\n  let imag_part_sample_stddev := 0.8;\n  let imag_part_sample_size := 30;\n  let t_statistic_real := (real_part_sample_mean - real_part_mean) / (real_part_sample_stddev / \u221areal_part_sample_size);\n  let t_statistic_imag := (imag_part_sample_mean - imag_part_mean) / (imag_part_sample_stddev / \u221aimag_part_sample_size);\n  let critical_t_value := 2.045;\n  t_statistic_real \u2264 critical_t_value \u2227 t_statistic_imag \u2264 critical_t_value\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  Float.sqrt real_part_sample_size\nargument\n  real_part_sample_size\nhas type\n  \u2115 : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  Float : Type\nfailed to synthesize\n  HSub Float \u2115 ?m.2339\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\napplication type mismatch\n  Float.sqrt imag_part_sample_size\nargument\n  imag_part_sample_size\nhas type\n  \u2115 : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  Float : Type\nfailed to synthesize\n  HSub Float \u2115 ?m.4594\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\napplication type mismatch\n  Float.sqrt real_part_sample_size\nargument\n  real_part_sample_size\nhas type\n  \u2115 : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  Float : Type\nfailed to synthesize\n  HSub Float \u2115 ?m.12684\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\ntype mismatch\n  rfl\nhas type\n  true = true : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  true = (4.8 - 5) / (1 / Float.sqrt 30) : Prop\nfailed to synthesize\n  HDiv Float Float Bool\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nunexpected relation type\n  (\u03b1 : Type ?u.11297) \u2192 optParam Bool false \u2192 \u03b1\napplication type mismatch\n  Float.sqrt imag_part_sample_size\nargument\n  imag_part_sample_size\nhas type\n  \u2115 : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  Float : Type\nfailed to synthesize\n  HSub Float \u2115 ?m.24883\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\ntype mismatch\n  rfl\nhas type\n  true = true : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  true = (2.9 - 3) / (0.8 / Float.sqrt 30) : Prop\nfailed to synthesize\n  HDiv Float Float Bool\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nunexpected relation type\n  (\u03b1 : Type ?u.23496) \u2192 optParam Bool false \u2192 \u03b1\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  Float.sqrt real_part_sample_size\nargument\n  real_part_sample_size\nhas type\n  \u2115 : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  Float : Type\nfailed to synthesize\n  HSub Float \u2115 ?m.2339\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\napplication type mismatch\n  Float.sqrt imag_part_sample_size\nargument\n  imag_part_sample_size\nhas type\n  \u2115 : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  Float : Type\nfailed to synthesize\n  HSub Float \u2115 ?m.4594\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\napplication type mismatch\n  Float.sqrt real_part_sample_size\nargument\n  real_part_sample_size\nhas type\n  \u2115 : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  Float : Type\nfailed to synthesize\n  HSub Float \u2115 ?m.6861\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nunsolved goals\n\u22a2 t_statistic_real \u2264 critical_t_value \u2227 t_statistic_imag \u2264 critical_t_value\nPlease revise the proof.",

The derivative of a function gives us the slope of the tangent line to the curve at any point \\( x \\). This slope tells us whether the function is increasing or decreasing at that point.\n\nLet's start by finding the derivative of \\( f(x) \\). The function \\( f(x) = 5x^2 - 3x + 2 \\) is a polynomial, and we can use basic rules of differentiation to find its derivative:\n\n1. The derivative of \\( 5x^2 \\) is found by using the power rule, which states that the derivative of \\( ax^n \\) is \\( nax^{n-1} \\). Applying this rule, the derivative of \\( 5x^2 \\) is \\( 2 \\times 5x^{2-1} = 10x \\).\n\n2. The derivative of \\(-3x\\) is straightforward. The derivative of \\( ax \\) is simply \\( a \\), so the derivative of \\(-3x\\) is \\(-3\\).\n\n3. The derivative of a constant, like \\( 2 \\), is \\( 0 \\) because constants do not change, and thus their rate of change is zero.\n\nPutting it all together, the derivative of \\( f(x) = 5x^2 - 3x + 2 \\) is:\n\\[ f'(x) = 10x - 3. \\]\n\nNow, to determine where the function is increasing or decreasing, we need to analyze the sign of \\( f'(x) \\):\n\n- The function is **increasing** where \\( f'(x) > 0 \\).\n- The function is **decreasing** where \\( f'(x) < 0 \\).\n\nLet's solve the inequality \\( 10x - 3 > 0 \\) to find where the function is increasing:\n\n1. Add 3 to both sides: \\( 10x > 3 \\).\n2. Divide both sides by 10: \\( x > \\frac{3}{10} \\).\n\nThis tells us that the function is increasing for \\( x > \\frac{3}{10} \\).\n\nNext, solve the inequality \\( 10x - 3 < 0 \\) to find where the function is decreasing:\n\n1. Add 3 to both sides: \\( 10x < 3 \\).\n2. Divide both sides by 10: \\( x < \\frac{3}{10} \\).\n\nThis tells us that the function is decreasing for \\( x < \\frac{3}{10} \\).\n\nIn summary, the function \\( f(x) = 5x^2 - 3x + 2 \\) is increasing when \\( x > \\frac{3}{10} \\) and decreasing when \\( x < \\frac{3}{10} \\). At \\( x = \\frac{3}{10} \\), the derivative is zero, indicating a potential minimum or maximum point, but since the function changes from decreasing to increasing, it is a minimum point.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

Typically, when we talk about the slope of a vector, we're considering a 2-dimensional vector space where vectors can be represented as \\((x, y)\\) pairs. The slope of such a vector is given by the ratio \\(y/x\\), assuming \\(x \\neq 0\\).\n\nLet's denote the vector \\(u\\) as \\((u_1, u_2)\\) and the vector \\(v\\) as \\((v_1, v_2)\\). According to the problem, the slope of \\(u\\) is twice the slope of \\(v\\). This means:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{u_2}{u_1} = 2 \\cdot \\frac{v_2}{v_1}\n\\]\n\nThis equation implies that:\n\n\\[\nu_2 \\cdot v_1 = 2 \\cdot v_2 \\cdot u_1\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find the slope of the vector resulting from the operation \\(cu + v\\). The vector \\(cu + v\\) is obtained by scaling \\(u\\) by the scalar \\(c\\) and then adding \\(v\\). This results in the vector:\n\n\\[\ncu + v = (cu_1 + v_1, cu_2 + v_2)\n\\]\n\nThe slope of this new vector is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{cu_2 + v_2}{cu_1 + v_1}\n\\]\n\nWe want to show that this slope is equal to the slope of \\(u\\), which is \\(\\frac{u_2}{u_1}\\).\n\nLet's substitute the relationship we have from the slope condition:\n\nSince \\(u_2 \\cdot v_1 = 2 \\cdot v_2 \\cdot u_1\\), we can express \\(v_2\\) in terms of \\(u_2\\) and \\(v_1\\):\n\n\\[\nv_2 = \\frac{u_2 \\cdot v_1}{2 \\cdot u_1}\n\\]\n\nSubstitute this into the expression for the slope of \\(cu + v\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{cu_2 + \\frac{u_2 \\cdot v_1}{2 \\cdot u_1}}{cu_1 + v_1}\n\\]\n\nFactor out \\(u_2\\) from the numerator:\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{u_2 \\left(c + \\frac{v_1}{2 \\cdot u_1}\\right)}{cu_1 + v_1}\n\\]\n\nNow, notice that the term \\(\\frac{v_1}{2 \\cdot u_1}\\) in the numerator is exactly half of the term \\(\\frac{v_1}{u_1}\\) in the denominator when multiplied by \\(c\\). This is because the relationship \\(u_2 \\cdot v_1 = 2 \\cdot v_2 \\cdot u_1\\) ensures that the contributions of \\(v_1\\) and \\(v_2\\) are balanced in such a way that the slope simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{u_2}{u_1}\n\\]\n\nThus, the slope of the vector \\(cu + v\\) is indeed equal to the slope of \\(u\\), as required.

The problem states that the cube has a side length of 5 cm. \n\nA cube is a three-dimensional shape where all sides are equal in length. The volume of a cube can be calculated by raising the side length to the third power (cubing the side length). So, for our cube with a side length of 5 cm, the volume is calculated as follows:\n\nVolume = side length \u00d7 side length \u00d7 side length = 5 cm \u00d7 5 cm \u00d7 5 cm = 125 cubic centimeters.\n\nNext, we need to find out the mass of the cube. The problem tells us that each cubic centimeter of the cube has a mass of 2 grams. This means that for every cubic centimeter of volume, the cube has a mass of 2 grams.\n\nSince the cube has a total volume of 125 cubic centimeters, we can find the total mass by multiplying the volume by the mass per cubic centimeter:\n\nMass = volume \u00d7 mass per cubic centimeter = 125 cubic centimeters \u00d7 2 grams per cubic centimeter = 250 grams.\n\nTherefore, the mass of the cube is 250 grams.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'calc'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'calc'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

Then, we'll compare the volume of the cylinder to twice the area of the circle to see if it is greater.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the area of the circle. The formula for the area of a circle is given by:\n\n\\[ \\text{Area of a circle} = \\pi \\times r^2 \\]\n\nwhere \\( r \\) is the radius of the circle. In this case, the radius \\( r \\) is 4 units. Plugging this into the formula, we get:\n\n\\[ \\text{Area of the circle} = \\pi \\times 4^2 = \\pi \\times 16 = 16\\pi \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the volume of the cylinder. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Volume of a cylinder} = \\pi \\times r^2 \\times h \\]\n\nwhere \\( r \\) is the radius of the base of the cylinder and \\( h \\) is the height of the cylinder. Here, the radius \\( r \\) is 4 units and the height \\( h \\) is 10 units. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:\n\n\\[ \\text{Volume of the cylinder} = \\pi \\times 4^2 \\times 10 = \\pi \\times 16 \\times 10 = 160\\pi \\]\n\nNow, we need to compare the volume of the cylinder to twice the area of the circle. We already calculated the area of the circle as \\( 16\\pi \\). So, twice the area of the circle is:\n\n\\[ 2 \\times 16\\pi = 32\\pi \\]\n\nFinally, let's compare the two quantities:\n\n- Volume of the cylinder: \\( 160\\pi \\)\n- Twice the area of the circle: \\( 32\\pi \\)\n\nClearly, \\( 160\\pi \\) is much larger than \\( 32\\pi \\).

        "informal_proof": "# Informal Proof:\n\nTo understand why the Laplace transform of a continuous function is also continuous, let's first recall what the Laplace transform is. Given a continuous function \\( f(t) \\) defined for \\( t \\geq 0 \\), its Laplace transform \\( F(s) \\) is defined as:\n\n\\[ F(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} f(t) \\, dt \\]\n\nwhere \\( s \\) is a complex number with a real part that is sufficiently large to ensure the integral converges.\n\nNow, let's consider why \\( F(s) \\) is continuous. The key idea here is to look at how small changes in \\( s \\) affect the value of \\( F(s) \\). For \\( F(s) \\) to be continuous at a point \\( s_0 \\), we need to show that as \\( s \\) approaches \\( s_0 \\), \\( F(s) \\) approaches \\( F(s_0) \\).\n\n1. **Convergence of the Integral**: The integral defining \\( F(s) \\) converges for values of \\( s \\) with a sufficiently large real part. This is because the exponential term \\( e^{-st} \\) decays rapidly as \\( t \\) increases, especially when the real part of \\( s \\) is large. This decay ensures that the integral does not blow up and is well-defined.\n\n2. **Effect of Small Changes in \\( s \\)**: Consider a small change in \\( s \\), say from \\( s_0 \\) to \\( s_0 + \\Delta s \\). The function inside the integral becomes \\( e^{-(s_0 + \\Delta s)t} f(t) \\). The change in the exponential term is \\( e^{-\\Delta s t} \\), which is close to 1 for small \\( \\Delta s \\) and for each fixed \\( t \\).\n\n3. **Uniform Convergence**: For a fixed \\( t \\), the function \\( e^{-\\Delta s t} \\) approaches 1 as \\( \\Delta s \\) approaches 0. This means that the integrand \\( e^{-(s_0 + \\Delta s)t} f(t) \\) approaches \\( e^{-s_0 t} f(t) \\) pointwise for each \\( t \\).\n\n4. **Dominated Convergence Theorem**: To rigorously argue that the integral of the limit is the limit of the integrals, we can use the Dominated Convergence Theorem. Since \\( f(t) \\) is continuous and \\( e^{-st} \\) is bounded by \\( e^{-\\text{Re}(s)t} \\), which is integrable over \\( [0, \\infty) \\) for sufficiently large real parts of \\( s \\), the conditions of the theorem are satisfied. This allows us to interchange the limit and the integral.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: As \\( \\Delta s \\) approaches 0, the integral of the perturbed function \\( e^{-(s_0 + \\Delta s)t} f(t) \\) approaches the integral of the original function \\( e^{-s_0 t} f(t) \\). Therefore, \\( F(s) \\) approaches \\( F(s_0) \\) as \\( s \\) approaches \\( s_0 \\), proving that \\( F(s) \\) is continuous.\n\nIn summary, the continuity of the Laplace transform \\( F(s) \\) follows from the continuity of the original function \\( f(t) \\), the properties of the exponential function, and the application of the Dominated Convergence Theorem, which together ensure that small changes in \\( s \\) result in small changes in \\( F(s) \\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  f t\nargument\n  t\nhas type\n  \u2102 : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u211d : Type\nfailed to synthesize\n  Preorder \u2102\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\ninvalid binder annotation, type is not a class instance\n  Continuous f\nuse the command `set_option checkBinderAnnotations false` to disable the check\nunknown identifier 'continuous_of_continuous_on_of_isCompact'\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  f t\nargument\n  t\nhas type\n  \u2102 : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u211d : Type\nfailed to synthesize\n  Preorder \u2102\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nunknown identifier 'continuous_of_continuous_on_of_isCompact'\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: expected token\nPlease revise the proof.",

For a continuous function like \\(f(x)\\), this area can be thought of as the \"total accumulation\" of the function's values over the interval.\n\nNow, according to the problem, we have a dataset that shows the minimum value of \\(f(x)\\) on \\([a, b]\\) is \\(k\\) and the maximum value is \\(m\\). This means that for every \\(x\\) in the interval \\([a, b]\\), the function value \\(f(x)\\) is at least \\(k\\) and at most \\(m\\). In other words, \\(k \\leq f(x) \\leq m\\) for all \\(x\\) in \\([a, b]\\).\n\nThe integral of \\(f(x)\\) from \\(a\\) to \\(b\\), denoted as \\(\\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx\\), can be thought of as summing up all these function values over the interval. If we imagine replacing every value of \\(f(x)\\) with the minimum value \\(k\\), the integral would be \\(\\int_a^b k \\, dx\\), which simplifies to \\(k(b-a)\\). This represents the smallest possible \"accumulation\" of function values over the interval, assuming \\(f(x)\\) is constantly at its minimum value.\n\nSimilarly, if we replace every value of \\(f(x)\\) with the maximum value \\(m\\), the integral becomes \\(\\int_a^b m \\, dx\\), which simplifies to \\(m(b-a)\\). This represents the largest possible \"accumulation\" of function values over the interval, assuming \\(f(x)\\) is constantly at its maximum value.\n\nSince the actual function values \\(f(x)\\) are always between \\(k\\) and \\(m\\), the true integral \\(\\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx\\) must also lie between these two extremes. Therefore, we have:\n\n\\[ (b-a)k \\leq \\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx \\leq (b-a)m. \\]\n\nThis reasoning shows that the definite integral of \\(f(x)\\) over \\([a, b]\\) is indeed bounded by \\((b-a)k\\) and \\((b-a)m\\), as required.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'integral_mono_on'\nunknown identifier 'integral_mono_on'\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown namespace 'Set'\nunknown constant 'OfNat'\nunknown constant 'sorryAx'\nunknown constant 'sorryAx'\nunexpected token '*'; expected command\nexpected token\nexpected token\nexpected token\nunexpected token '-'; expected ')', ',' or ':'\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown namespace 'Set'\nunknown constant 'OfNat'\nunknown constant 'sorryAx'\nunknown constant 'sorryAx'\nunexpected token '*'; expected command\nexpected token\nexpected token\nexpected token\nunexpected token '-'; expected ')', ',' or ':'\nPlease revise the proof.",

The term \\(2x\\) becomes \\(2 \\times 5\\). When we multiply 2 by 5, we get 10. So, the term \\(2x\\) evaluates to 10.\n\nNext, we substitute \\(y = 3\\) into the expression.

Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, identify the key components of the problem. We have a set of assumptions or premises, and we need to derive a conclusion from these. The assumptions might involve properties of numbers, sets, functions, or other mathematical objects, and the conclusion is typically a statement that follows logically from these assumptions.\n\nNext, consider each assumption and how it contributes to the overall argument. For example, if we have an assumption about a function being continuous, we might use this to argue about the behavior of the function at certain points. Similarly, if we have an assumption about a number being positive, we can use this to infer properties about expressions involving that number.\n\nOnce we understand the role of each assumption, we can start constructing the argument. This involves linking the assumptions together in a logical sequence that leads to the conclusion. We might use direct reasoning, where we apply definitions and known theorems directly, or indirect reasoning, where we assume the opposite of the conclusion and derive a contradiction.\n\nThroughout the process, it's important to ensure that each step of the argument is justified. This means checking that we are applying definitions and theorems correctly and that each inference follows logically from the previous ones.\n\nFinally, once we have constructed a complete argument, we review it to ensure that it is clear and concise.

We need to show two things: first, that \\( a - b \\) is greater than 0, and second, that \\( b - a \\) is less than 0.\n\n1. **Proving \\( a - b > 0 \\):**\n\n   Since \\( a \\) is greater than \\( b \\), we can express this relationship as \\( a > b \\). This inequality tells us that if you subtract \\( b \\) from \\( a \\), the result should be a positive number. Why? Because when you take a larger number and subtract a smaller number from it, the difference is positive. \n\n   For example, if \\( a = 7 \\) and \\( b = 3 \\), then \\( a - b = 7 - 3 = 4 \\), which is indeed greater than 0.

Since we know \\( a > b \\), it follows that \\( b < a \\).

This holds true for any integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) where \\( a > b \\). Thus, we can conclude that \\( b - a < 0 \\).\n\nIn summary, the key idea is that when one number is greater than another, subtracting the smaller from the larger gives a positive result, and subtracting the larger from the smaller gives a negative result.

In other words, there is no linear change in the function's value in any direction from this point.\n\nHowever, having zero partial derivatives is a necessary condition for a local extremum, but not sufficient by itself. To further analyze the situation, we need to consider the second derivatives, which are encapsulated in the Hessian matrix. The Hessian matrix at \\( (a, b) \\) is a 2x2 matrix composed of the second partial derivatives of \\( f \\). The nature of the extremum (if it exists) depends on the eigenvalues of this Hessian matrix.\n\n1. If the Hessian is positive definite (both eigenvalues are positive), then \\( f \\) has a local minimum at \\( (a, b) \\).\n2. If the Hessian is negative definite (both eigenvalues are negative), then \\( f \\) has a local maximum at \\( (a, b) \\).\n3. If the Hessian is indefinite (eigenvalues have different signs), then \\( (a, b) \\) is a saddle point, not a local extremum.\n\nIn summary, the condition that both partial derivatives are zero at \\( (a, b) \\) indicates that \\( (a, b) \\) is a critical point. To confirm whether it is a local extremum, we must examine the second derivatives through the Hessian matrix. If the Hessian is either positive or negative definite, then \\( f \\) indeed has a local extremum at \\( (a, b) \\). If not, \\( (a, b) \\) is not a point of local extremum.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unexpected token '\u2202'; expected term\nunexpected token '\u2202'; expected term\nexpected token\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unexpected token '\u2202'; expected term\nunexpected token '\u2202'; expected term\nexpected token\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unexpected token '\u2202'; expected term\nunexpected token '\u2202'; expected term\nunexpected token '\u2202'; expected term\nunsolved goals\ncase h\nf : \u211d \u00d7 \u211d \u2192 \u211d\na b : \u211d\nh1 : sorryAx (Sort ?u.53) true\nh2 : sorryAx (Sort ?u.55) true\n\u22a2 \u211d \u2192 \u211d \u2192 sorryAx (Sort ?u.1732) true\n\nf : \u211d \u00d7 \u211d \u2192 \u211d\na b : \u211d\nh1 : sorryAx (Sort ?u.53) true\nh2 : sorryAx (Sort ?u.55) true\nh : \u211d \u2192 \u211d \u2192 sorryAx (Sort ?u.1732) true\n\u22a2 \u2203 \u03b5 > 0, \u2200 (x y : \u211d), (x - a) ^ 2 + (y - b) ^ 2 < \u03b5 ^ 2 \u2192 IsLocalExtr f (x, y)\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "# Informal Proof:\nTo understand why the product of two negative numbers is positive, let's start by considering what it means for a number to be negative. A negative number is simply a number that is less than zero. So, when we say \"negative numbers,\" we're talking about numbers like -1, -2, -3, and so on.\n\nNow, let's think about multiplication in terms of repeated addition. For example, multiplying 3 by 4 can be thought of as adding 3 to itself 4 times: 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 12. This idea helps us understand multiplication in a more intuitive way.\n\nWhen we multiply a negative number by a positive number, say -a by b, we can think of it as subtracting a from zero b times. For instance, if a = 2 and b = 3, then -a * b = -2 * 3 = -2 - 2 - 2 = -6. This is why the product of a negative and a positive number is negative.\n\nNow, let's consider what happens when we multiply two negative numbers, -a and -b. We can use the idea of reversing direction. Multiplying by a negative number can be thought of as reversing the direction on the number line. So, if we start at zero and move in the negative direction by a certain amount, multiplying by another negative number reverses that direction again, bringing us back into the positive side.\n\nTo see this more clearly, let's use an example. Suppose a = 2 and b = 3. Then, -a = -2 and -b = -3. If we multiply -2 by -3, we can think of it as reversing the direction twice. First, -2 would take us 2 units to the left of zero, but then multiplying by -3 reverses that direction, effectively moving us 6 units to the right of zero, resulting in a positive 6.\n\nAnother way to think about this is through the rules of signs in multiplication. We know that:\n- A positive times a positive is positive.\n- A positive times a negative is negative.\n- A negative times a positive is negative.\n- A negative times a negative is positive.\n\nThese rules are consistent with the idea of reversing direction. When we multiply two negative numbers, the first negative reverses the direction, and the second negative reverses it again, bringing us back to the positive side.\n\nTherefore, for any two negative numbers a and b, their product is positive because multiplying by a negative number twice reverses the direction twice, resulting in a positive outcome.",

If \\( f'(x) = 0 \\) for all \\( x \\) in the interval \\( (x_1, x_2) \\), this tells us that the slope of the tangent line to the function is zero everywhere in this interval. A zero slope means that the tangent line is horizontal.\n\nNow, if the tangent line is horizontal at every point in the interval \\( (x_1, x_2) \\), the function itself must be constant over this interval. Why? Because if the function were to increase or decrease at any point, the slope of the tangent line would not be zero at that point. Therefore, the only way for the derivative to be zero everywhere in the interval is if the function does not change at all\u2014it remains constant.\n\nSince the function is constant on the interval \\( (x_1, x_2) \\), the value of the function at \\( x_1 \\) must be the same as its value at \\( x_2 \\). In other words, \\( f(x_1) = f(x_2) \\).\n\nThis reasoning aligns with the Mean Value Theorem, which states that if a function is continuous on a closed interval and differentiable on the open interval, there exists at least one point where the derivative equals the average rate of change over the interval. However, in our case, since the derivative is zero everywhere, the average rate of change is zero, confirming that the function does not change between \\( x_1 \\) and \\( x_2 \\).\n\nThus, we conclude that if \\( f'(x) = 0 \\) for all \\( x \\) in \\( (x_1, x_2) \\), then \\( f(x_1) = f(x_2) \\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: function expected at\n  Ioo\nterm has type\n  ?m.91\nfunction expected at\n  Ioo\nterm has type\n  x\u271d\nunsolved goals\nx\u271d : Sort u_1\nIoo : x\u271d\nf : \u211d \u2192 \u211d\nx1 x2 : \u211d\nh : x1 < x2\nhf : \u2200 x \u2208 ?m.1606 f x1 x2 h x, HasDerivAt f 0 x\n\u22a2 f x1 = f x2\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: function expected at\n  Ioo\nterm has type\n  ?m.91\nfunction expected at\n  Ioo\nterm has type\n  x\u271d\nunsolved goals\nx\u271d : Sort u_1\nIoo : x\u271d\nf : \u211d \u2192 \u211d\nx1 x2 : \u211d\nh : x1 < x2\nhf : \u2200 x \u2208 ?m.1606 f x1 x2 h x, HasDerivAt f 0 x\n\u22a2 f x1 = f x2\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: function expected at\n  Ioo\nterm has type\n  ?m.91\nfunction expected at\n  Ioo\nterm has type\n  x\u271d\nunsolved goals\nx\u271d : Sort u_1\nIoo : x\u271d\nf : \u211d \u2192 \u211d\nx1 x2 : \u211d\nh : x1 < x2\nhf : \u2200 x \u2208 ?m.1606 f x1 x2 h x, HasDerivAt f 0 x\n\u22a2 f x1 = f x2\nPlease revise the proof.",

The garden is rectangular with a length of 6 meters and a width of 4 meters. The area of a rectangle is found by multiplying its length by its width. So, the area of the garden is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Area of the garden} = 6 \\, \\text{meters} \\times 4 \\, \\text{meters} = 24 \\, \\text{square meters}. \\]\n\nNext, we need to consider the path that surrounds the garden. The path is 1 meter wide and goes all the way around the garden. This means the path adds 1 meter to each side of the garden's length and width. Therefore, the new dimensions of the entire structure (garden plus path) are:\n\n- New length = original length + 2 meters (1 meter on each side) = 6 meters + 2 meters = 8 meters.\n- New width = original width + 2 meters (1 meter on each side) = 4 meters + 2 meters = 6 meters.\n\nNow, we calculate the area of the entire structure, which includes both the garden and the path.

The first half contains the first n/2 numbers, and the second half contains the remaining n/2 numbers.\n\n3. **Locating the Middle Two Numbers**: The two numbers that are in the middle of this sorted list are the (n/2)th number and the ((n/2) + 1)th number. These two numbers are the last number of the first half and the first number of the second half, respectively.\n\n4. **Calculating the Median**: Since there is no single middle number, the median is defined as the average of these two middle numbers. This is because the median should reflect a central value, and averaging the two middle numbers gives us a value that is exactly halfway between them, thus representing the center of the data set.\n\n5. **Why the Average?**: By taking the average of the (n/2)th and ((n/2) + 1)th numbers, we ensure that the median is a value that balances the data set. It is a compromise between the two central numbers, which is why it effectively represents the \"middle\" of the set.\n\nIn summary, when n is even, the median is not a single number but rather the average of the two numbers that are closest to the center of the sorted list. This method ensures that the median accurately reflects the central tendency of the data set.\nPrevious attempt failed with: function expected at\n  median\nterm has type\n  ?m.157\nunknown constant 'Nat.ne_of_eq_of_ne'\ntype mismatch\n  succ_lt_succ h1\nhas type\n  half.succ < n.succ : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  half + 1 < n : Prop\nfunction expected at\n  Finset.sort (fun x x_1 => x \u2264 x_1) s\nterm has type\n  List \u2115\nunsolved goals\nx\u271d : Sort u_1\nmedian : x\u271d\nn : \u2115\nhn : n % 2 = 0\ns : Finset \u2115\nhs : s.card = n\nhalf : \u2115 := n / 2\nh1 : half < n\nh2 : half + 1 < n\n\u22a2 \u2203 a b, a \u2208 s \u2227 b \u2208 s \u2227 a \u2264 b \u2227 sorryAx \u2115 true = (a + b) / 2\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: function expected at\n  median\nterm has type\n  ?m.179\nunknown constant 'Nat.ne_of_eq_of_ne'\ntype mismatch\n  succ_lt_succ h1\nhas type\n  half.succ < n.succ : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  half + 1 < n : Prop\nfailed to prove index is valid, possible solutions:\n  - Use `have`-expressions to prove the index is valid\n  - Use `a[i]!` notation instead, runtime check is perfomed, and 'Panic' error message is produced if index is not valid\n  - Use `a[i]?` notation instead, result is an `Option` type\n  - Use `a[i]'h` notation instead, where `h` is a proof that index is valid\nx\u271d : Sort u_1\nmedian : x\u271d\nn : \u2115\nhn : n % 2 = 0\ns : Finset \u2115\nhs : s.card = n\nhalf : \u2115 := n / 2\nh1 : half < n\nh2 : half + 1 < n\nsorted_s : List \u2115 := Finset.sort (fun x y => x \u2264 y) s\n\u22a2 half < sorted_s.length\nfailed to prove index is valid, possible solutions:\n  - Use `have`-expressions to prove the index is valid\n  - Use `a[i]!` notation instead, runtime check is perfomed, and 'Panic' error message is produced if index is not valid\n  - Use `a[i]?` notation instead, result is an `Option` type\n  - Use `a[i]'h` notation instead, where `h` is a proof that index is valid\nx\u271d : Sort u_1\nmedian : x\u271d\nn : \u2115\nhn : n % 2 = 0\ns : Finset \u2115\nhs : s.card = n\nhalf : \u2115 := n / 2\nh1 : half < n\nh2 : half + 1 < n\nsorted_s : List \u2115 := Finset.sort (fun x y => x \u2264 y) s\n\u22a2 half + 1 < sorted_s.length\nunknown constant 'Finset.mem_sort_of_mem'\nunknown constant 'Finset.mem_sort_of_mem'\nunknown constant 'Finset.le_of_sort_of_le'\ninvalid argument, variable is not a proposition or let-declaration\nunknown constant 'Nat.ne_of_eq_of_ne'\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase h1.h\nx\u271d : Sort u_1\nmedian : x\u271d\nn : \u2115\nhn : n % 2 = 0\ns : Finset \u2115\nhs : s.card = n\nhalf : \u2115 := n / 2\nh1 : half < n\nh2 : half + 1 < n\nsorted_s : List \u2115 := Finset.sort (fun x y => x \u2264 y) s\na\u271d : sorted_s.get \u27e8half + 1, \u22ef\u27e9 + sorted_s.get \u27e8half, \u22ef\u27e9 < sorryAx \u2115 true * 2\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'let'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

This is a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients.\n\nThe characteristic equation for this differential equation is obtained by assuming a solution of the form \\( y = e^{rt} \\), where \\( r \\) is a constant. Substituting this into the differential equation gives:\n\n\\[ r^2 e^{rt} - e^{rt} = 0. \\]\n\nFactoring out \\( e^{rt} \\) (which is never zero), we get:\n\n\\[ r^2 - 1 = 0. \\]\n\nSolving this quadratic equation, we find the roots \\( r = 1 \\) and \\( r = -1 \\). These roots indicate that the general solution of the differential equation is:\n\n\\[ y(t) = C_1 e^t + C_2 e^{-t}, \\]\n\nwhere \\( C_1 \\) and \\( C_2 \\) are constants to be determined by the boundary conditions.\n\nNow, let's apply the boundary conditions to find these constants. The first condition is \\( y(0) = 1 \\). Substituting \\( t = 0 \\) into the general solution gives:\n\n\\[ y(0) = C_1 e^0 + C_2 e^0 = C_1 + C_2 = 1. \\]\n\nThe second condition is \\( y'(0) = 0 \\). First, we find the derivative of the general solution:\n\n\\[ y'(t) = C_1 e^t - C_2 e^{-t}. \\]\n\nSubstituting \\( t = 0 \\) into this derivative gives:\n\n\\[ y'(0) = C_1 e^0 - C_2 e^0 = C_1 - C_2 = 0. \\]\n\nNow we have a system of two equations:\n\n1. \\( C_1 + C_2 = 1 \\)\n2. \\( C_1 - C_2 = 0 \\)\n\nSolving this system, we add the two equations to eliminate \\( C_2 \\):\n\n\\[ (C_1 + C_2) + (C_1 - C_2) = 1 + 0 \\]\n\\[ 2C_1 = 1 \\]\n\\[ C_1 = \\frac{1}{2}. \\]\n\nSubstituting \\( C_1 = \\frac{1}{2} \\) into the first equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2} + C_2 = 1 \\]\n\\[ C_2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}. \\]\n\nThus, the solution in the original coordinate system is:\n\n\\[ y(t) = \\frac{1}{2} e^t + \\frac{1}{2} e^{-t}. \\]\n\nNow, we need to express this solution in the new coordinate system defined by the basis vectors \\( v_1 = (1,0) \\) and \\( v_2 = (0,1) \\). In this context, the basis vectors represent the standard basis for the space of solutions, where \\( v_1 \\) corresponds to the function \\( e^t \\) and \\( v_2 \\) corresponds to the function \\( e^{-t} \\).\n\nThe solution \\( y(t) = \\frac{1}{2} e^t + \\frac{1}{2} e^{-t} \\) can be expressed in terms of these basis functions as:\n\n\\[ y(t) = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot e^t + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot e^{-t}. \\]\n\nThus, in the new coordinate system, the solution is represented by the vector:\n\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2} \\right). \\]\n\nThis vector indicates the coefficients of the basis functions \\( e^t \\) and \\( e^{-t} \\) in the solution. Therefore, the solution in the new coordinate system is simply the vector \\( \\left( \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2} \\right) \\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  NontriviallyNormedField (\u211d \u2192 \u211d)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\ninvalid declaration name 'v1', there is a section variable with the same name\ninvalid declaration name 'v2', there is a section variable with the same name\ninvalid declaration name 'sol', there is a section variable with the same name\nfunction expected at\n  boundary_conditions\nterm has type\n  Prop\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  And fun y => ?m.96 y = 1\nargument\n  fun y => ?m.96 y = 1\nhas type\n  ?m.64 \u2192 Prop : Sort (max 1 ?u.63)\nbut is expected to have type\n  Prop : Type\nfailed to synthesize\n  NontriviallyNormedField \u2115\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  NormedAddCommGroup \u2115\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  NormedSpace \u2115 \u2115\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfunction expected at\n  y\nterm has type\n  ?m.64\ncompiler IR check failed at 'general_solution', error: unknown declaration 'Real.exp'\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.exp', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.exp', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\nfunction expected at\n  boundary_conditions\nterm has type\n  Prop\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nfunction expected at\n  boundary_conditions\nterm has type\n  Prop\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: function expected at\n  y\nterm has type\n  \u211d\nfunction expected at\n  y'\nterm has type\n  \u211d\ncompiler IR check failed at 'general_solution', error: unknown declaration 'Real.exp'\ncompiler IR check failed at 'general_solution_deriv', error: unknown declaration 'Real.exp'\napplication type mismatch\n  boundary_conditions (general_solution C1 C2)\nargument\n  general_solution C1 C2\nhas type\n  \u211d \u2192 \u211d : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u211d : Type\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nfailed to synthesize\n  HAdd \u211d \u211d (\u211d \u2192 \u211d)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\napplication type mismatch\n  diff_eq (solution_new_coords t)\nargument\n  solution_new_coords t\nhas type\n  \u211d \u2192 \u211d : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u211d : Type\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\napplication type mismatch\n  boundary_conditions (solution_new_coords 0)\nargument\n  solution_new_coords 0\nhas type\n  \u211d \u2192 \u211d : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u211d : Type\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\napplication type mismatch\n  boundary_conditions (general_solution C1 C2)\nargument\n  general_solution C1 C2\nhas type\n  \u211d \u2192 \u211d : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u211d : Type\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",
