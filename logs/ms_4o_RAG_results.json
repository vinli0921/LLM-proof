        "informal_proof": "# Informal Proof:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to show that the average of the lowest and highest scores in the class is less than or equal to the average score of all the students in the class. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's define some terms:\n- Let the lowest score in the class be \\( L = 45 \\).\n- Let the highest score in the class be \\( H = 100 \\).\n- The average of the lowest and highest scores is \\(\\frac{L + H}{2}\\).\n\nNow, let's consider the average score of the entire class. Suppose the scores of the 30 students are \\( s_1, s_2, \\ldots, s_{30} \\). The average score of the class is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average score} = \\frac{s_1 + s_2 + \\cdots + s_{30}}{30}\n\\]\n\nWe need to show that:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{L + H}{2} \\leq \\frac{s_1 + s_2 + \\cdots + s_{30}}{30}\n\\]\n\nTo understand why this inequality holds, consider the following reasoning:\n\n1. **Range of Scores**: The scores range from 45 to 100, meaning every score \\( s_i \\) satisfies \\( 45 \\leq s_i \\leq 100 \\).\n\n2. **Sum of Scores**: The sum of all scores, \\( s_1 + s_2 + \\cdots + s_{30} \\), is influenced by the fact that each score is at least 45 and at most 100. This means the total sum is at least \\( 30 \\times 45 \\) and at most \\( 30 \\times 100 \\).\n\n3. **Average of Extremes**: The average of the lowest and highest scores is:\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{45 + 100}{2} = \\frac{145}{2} = 72.5\n   \\]\n\n4. **Class Average**: The class average is:\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{s_1 + s_2 + \\cdots + s_{30}}{30}\n   \\]\n\n   Since each score \\( s_i \\) is between 45 and 100, the average score must also lie between these two values. Specifically, if the scores are distributed in a way that some are closer to 100 and some are closer to 45, the average will balance out somewhere in between.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Given that the average score of the class is a weighted average of all individual scores, and considering the range of scores, it is reasonable to conclude that the class average will be at least 72.5. This is because the average of the lowest and highest scores (72.5) is a midpoint that is naturally less than or equal to the average of all scores, which takes into account the distribution of all scores.\n\nTherefore, the average of the lowest and highest scores is less than or equal to the average score of the class, as required.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'apply' failed, failed to unify\n  ?m.1642.sum ?m.1643 \u2264 ?m.1642.card \u2022 45\nwith\n  \u2211 i : Fin 30, scores i \u2265 30 * 45\nL H : \u2115\nscores : Fin 30 \u2192 \u2115\nhL : L = 45\nhH : H = 100\nh_scores : \u2200 (i : Fin 30), L \u2264 scores i \u2227 scores i \u2264 H\n\u22a2 \u2211 i : Fin 30, scores i \u2265 30 * 45\ntactic 'apply' failed, failed to unify\n  ?m / ?k \u2264 ?n\nwith\n  (\u2211 i : Fin 30, scores i) / 30 \u2265 45\nL H : \u2115\nscores : Fin 30 \u2192 \u2115\nhL : L = 45\nhH : H = 100\nh_scores : \u2200 (i : Fin 30), L \u2264 scores i \u2227 scores i \u2264 H\nh_sum : \u2211 i : Fin 30, scores i \u2265 30 * 45\n\u22a2 (\u2211 i : Fin 30, scores i) / 30 \u2265 45\ntactic 'apply' failed, failed to unify\n  ?a / ?c \u2264 ?b / ?c\nwith\n  (45 + 100) / 2 \u2264 (\u2211 i : Fin 30, scores i) / 30\nL H : \u2115\nscores : Fin 30 \u2192 \u2115\nhL : L = 45\nhH : H = 100\nh_scores : \u2200 (i : Fin 30), L \u2264 scores i \u2227 scores i \u2264 H\nh_sum : \u2211 i : Fin 30, scores i \u2265 30 * 45\nh_avg : (\u2211 i : Fin 30, scores i) / 30 \u2265 45\n\u22a2 (45 + 100) / 2 \u2264 (\u2211 i : Fin 30, scores i) / 30\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'apply' failed, failed to unify\n  ?m.1667.sum ?m.1668 \u2264 ?m.1667.card \u2022 45\nwith\n  \u2211 i : Fin 30, scores i \u2265 30 * 45\nscores : Fin 30 \u2192 \u2115\nhL : 45 = 45\nhH : 100 = 100\nh_scores : \u2200 (i : Fin 30), 45 \u2264 scores i \u2227 scores i \u2264 100\n\u22a2 \u2211 i : Fin 30, scores i \u2265 30 * 45\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, equality or iff proof expected\n  ?m.1878 / ?m.1880 \u2264 ?m.1879 / ?m.1880\nscores : Fin 30 \u2192 \u2115\nhL : 45 = 45\nhH : 100 = 100\nh_scores : \u2200 (i : Fin 30), 45 \u2264 scores i \u2227 scores i \u2264 100\nh_sum : \u2211 i : Fin 30, scores i \u2265 30 * 45\n\u22a2 (45 + 100) / 2 \u2264 (\u2211 i : Fin 30, scores i) / 30\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'apply' failed, failed to unify\n  ?m.1667.sum ?m.1668 \u2264 ?m.1667.card \u2022 45\nwith\n  \u2211 i : Fin 30, scores i \u2265 30 * 45\nscores : Fin 30 \u2192 \u2115\nhL : 45 = 45\nhH : 100 = 100\nh_scores : \u2200 (i : Fin 30), 45 \u2264 scores i \u2227 scores i \u2264 100\n\u22a2 \u2211 i : Fin 30, scores i \u2265 30 * 45\nunknown constant 'Nat.div_le_div_iff'\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, equality or iff proof expected\n  ?m.1879\nscores : Fin 30 \u2192 \u2115\nhL : 45 = 45\nhH : 100 = 100\nh_scores : \u2200 (i : Fin 30), 45 \u2264 scores i \u2227 scores i \u2264 100\nh_sum : \u2211 i : Fin 30, scores i \u2265 30 * 45\n\u22a2 (45 + 100) / 2 \u2264 (\u2211 i : Fin 30, scores i) / 30\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "# Informal Proof:\n\nTo prove that a polynomial \\( P(x) \\) of degree \\( n \\) cannot have \\( n+1 \\) distinct roots unless it is the zero polynomial, let's start by understanding what it means for a polynomial to have roots.\n\nA polynomial \\( P(x) \\) of degree \\( n \\) can be expressed in its factored form as:\n\n\\[ P(x) = a_n (x - r_1)(x - r_2) \\cdots (x - r_n) \\]\n\nwhere \\( r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_n \\) are the roots of the polynomial, and \\( a_n \\) is the leading coefficient. This expression shows that the polynomial is zero at each of these roots.\n\nNow, if we assume that \\( P(x) \\) has \\( n+1 \\) distinct roots, say \\( r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_{n+1} \\), we can attempt to write the polynomial as:\n\n\\[ P(x) = a_n (x - r_1)(x - r_2) \\cdots (x - r_{n+1}) \\]\n\nHowever, this expression implies that \\( P(x) \\) is a polynomial of degree \\( n+1 \\), because it has \\( n+1 \\) linear factors. This contradicts our initial statement that \\( P(x) \\) is a polynomial of degree \\( n \\).\n\nThe only way to resolve this contradiction is to conclude that the leading coefficient \\( a_n \\) must be zero, which means that every coefficient of the polynomial is zero. Therefore, \\( P(x) \\) must be the zero polynomial, which is the only polynomial that can have more roots than its degree.\n\nIn summary, a non-zero polynomial of degree \\( n \\) can have at most \\( n \\) distinct roots. If it appears to have more, it must be the zero polynomial.

Specifically, some students might have worn a red shirt on both days, and we want to ensure we don't count them twice.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. **Count of Students on Each Day**: \n   - On Monday, 10 students wore a red shirt.\n   - On Tuesday, 15 students wore a red shirt.\n\n2. **Total Students in the Class**: \n   - There are 30 students in the class.\n\n3. **Understanding Overlap**:\n   - If we simply add the numbers from Monday and Tuesday (10 + 15 = 25), we might be overcounting students who wore a red shirt on both days. \n   - The maximum number of students who could have worn a red shirt on both days is the smaller of the two daily counts, which is 10 (since only 10 students wore a red shirt on Monday).\n\n4. **Using the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion**:\n   - To find the total number of distinct students who wore a red shirt over the two days, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n   - This principle states that the total number of distinct elements in two sets is the sum of the sizes of the two sets minus the size of their intersection.\n   - In this context, the \"sets\" are the groups of students wearing red shirts on Monday and Tuesday.\n\n5. **Applying the Principle**:\n   - Let \\( A \\) be the set of students who wore a red shirt on Monday, and \\( B \\) be the set of students who wore a red shirt on Tuesday.\n   - The number of students in \\( A \\) is 10, and the number in \\( B \\) is 15.\n   - The number of students who wore a red shirt on both days (the intersection of \\( A \\) and \\( B \\)) is unknown, but it can be at most 10.\n\n6. **Calculating the Total**:\n   - The total number of distinct students who wore a red shirt is given by:\n     \\[\n     |A \\cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \\cap B|\n     \\]\n   - Substituting the known values, we have:\n     \\[\n     |A \\cup B| = 10 + 15 - |A \\cap B|\n     \\]\n   - Since the maximum overlap is 10, the minimum number of distinct students is:\n     \\[\n     25 - 10 = 15\n     \\]\n   - However, if there is no overlap, the maximum number of distinct students is 25.\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - Without additional information about the exact overlap, we can only determine that the number of distinct students who wore a red shirt is between 15 and 25.\n   - If we assume the maximum overlap (10 students wore red shirts on both days), then 15 distinct students wore a red shirt over the two days.\n   - If there was no overlap, then 25 distinct students wore a red shirt.\n\nThus, the total number of distinct students who wore a red shirt on Monday and Tuesday is between 15 and 25, depending on the overlap.",

Speed is defined as the distance traveled per unit of time, so in this case, the car covers 60 miles every hour.\n\nNow, if the car continues to travel at this constant speed of 60 miles per hour, we can determine how far it will travel in any given number of hours by multiplying the speed by the time.

Therefore, we have successfully confirmed that the tangent of angle BAC is indeed \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: expected token\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  cos_BAC\nsin_BAC cos_BAC : \u211d\nh_sin : sin_BAC = 3 / 5\nh_cos : cos_BAC = 4 / 5\n\u22a2 3 / 5 / \u221a(1 - (3 / 5) ^ 2) = 3 / 4\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: The rfl tactic failed.

This represents a circle centered at the origin with radius \\( r \\). The graph of \\( g(x) = x^2 + r^2 \\) is a parabola that opens upwards, shifted vertically by \\( r^2 \\).\n\nTo find the points of intersection between the parabola and the circle, we set the \\( y \\)-values equal to each other:\n\n1. From the circle: \\( y^2 = r^2 - x^2 \\).\n2. From the parabola: \\( y = x^2 + r^2 \\).\n\nSubstitute the expression for \\( y \\) from the parabola into the circle's equation:\n\n\\[\n(x^2 + r^2)^2 = r^2 - x^2\n\\]\n\nThis equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nx^4 + 2r^2x^2 + r^4 = r^2 - x^2\n\\]\n\nRearranging terms gives:\n\n\\[\nx^4 + 2r^2x^2 + r^4 + x^2 - r^2 = 0\n\\]\n\nThis is a quartic (fourth-degree) polynomial in \\( x \\). To determine the number of real solutions (intersections), we need to analyze this polynomial. However, solving this directly is complex, so let's consider the geometry of the situation.\n\nThe parabola \\( y = x^2 + r^2 \\) is always above the line \\( y = r^2 \\) for all \\( x \\), because \\( x^2 \\) is always non-negative. The circle \\( x^2 + y^2 = r^2 \\) has its highest point at \\( y = r \\) when \\( x = 0 \\). For the parabola to intersect the circle, the \\( y \\)-value of the parabola must equal the \\( y \\)-value of the circle at some \\( x \\).\n\nHowever, since the parabola is shifted up by \\( r^2 \\), it never actually intersects the circle. The lowest point of the parabola is at \\( y = r^2 \\) when \\( x = 0 \\), which is above the highest point of the circle at \\( y = r \\). Therefore, the parabola \\( y = x^2 + r^2 \\) does not intersect the circle \\( x^2 + y^2 = r^2 \\) at any point.\n\nThus, for all \\( r > 0 \\), the graph of \\( g(x) = x^2 + r^2 \\) does not intersect the circle at any points, let alone exactly two points. The initial assumption that there could be intersections was incorrect due to the vertical shift of the parabola by \\( r^2 \\), which places it entirely above the circle.\nPrevious attempt failed with: 'circle' has already been declared\nfunction expected at\n  circle\nterm has type\n  Submonoid \u2102\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: 'circle' has already been declared\nfunction expected at\n  circle\nterm has type\n  Submonoid \u2102\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: 'circle' has already been declared\nfunction expected at\n  circle\nterm has type\n  Submonoid \u2102\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  y\nr : \u211d\nhr : r > 0\nx y : \u211d\nh1 : g r x = y\nh2 : sorryAx Prop true\nh3 : y = x ^ 2 + r ^ 2\n\u22a2 x ^ 2 + (x ^ 2 + r ^ 2) ^ 2 = r ^ 2\nunsolved goals\nr : \u211d\nhr : r > 0\nx y : \u211d\nh1 : g r x = y\nh2 : sorryAx Prop true\nh3 : y = x ^ 2 + r ^ 2\nh4 : x ^ 2 + (x ^ 2 + r ^ 2) ^ 2 = r ^ 2\n\u22a2 x ^ 2 + x ^ 2 * r ^ 2 * 2 + x ^ 4 + r ^ 4 = r ^ 2\nunsolved goals\ncase intro.intro.intro\nr : \u211d\nhr : r > 0\nx y : \u211d\nh1 : g r x = y\nh2 : sorryAx Prop true\nh3 : y = x ^ 2 + r ^ 2\nh4 : x ^ 2 + (x ^ 2 + r ^ 2) ^ 2 = r ^ 2\nh5 : x ^ 2 + x ^ 4 + 2 * r ^ 2 * x ^ 2 + r ^ 4 = r ^ 2\n\u22a2 False\nunexpected token 'at'; expected command\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "# Informal Proof:\n\nTo find the perimeter of the rectangle that David is drawing on a number line, we first need to understand the positions of the vertices. The vertices are given as points on a number line: -4, -1, 3, and 6. Since these points are on a number line, they represent the x-coordinates of the vertices of the rectangle.\n\nLet's arrange these points in increasing order: -4, -1, 3, and 6. These points can be paired to form the sides of the rectangle. The rectangle's sides will be parallel to the x-axis, and the distances between these points will represent the lengths of the sides.\n\n1. **Identify the Lengths of the Sides:**\n   - The distance between -4 and -1 is calculated as the absolute difference: |-1 - (-4)| = |-1 + 4| = |3| = 3.\n   - The distance between 3 and 6 is calculated similarly: |6 - 3| = 3.\n\n2. **Identify the Widths of the Sides:**\n   - The distance between -4 and 3 is calculated as: |3 - (-4)| = |3 + 4| = |7| = 7.\n   - The distance between -1 and 6 is calculated as: |6 - (-1)| = |6 + 1| = |7| = 7.\n\nNow, we have identified the lengths of the sides of the rectangle. The rectangle has two sides of length 3 and two sides of length 7.\n\n3. **Calculate the Perimeter:**\n   The perimeter of a rectangle is the sum of all its sides. Therefore, the perimeter is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Perimeter} = 2 \\times (\\text{Length} + \\text{Width}) = 2 \\times (3 + 7) = 2 \\times 10 = 20.\n   \\]\n\nThus, the perimeter of the rectangle that David is drawing is 20. This matches the structure of a rectangle where opposite sides are equal, and the perimeter is the sum of twice the length and twice the width.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  AddGroup \u2115\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: invalid field 'sort', the environment does not contain 'List.sort'\n  vertices\nhas type\n  List \u2124\nfailed to prove index is valid, possible solutions:\n  -

Let's use the fact that if \\((x, y)\\) is close to \\((1, 2)\\), then both \\(x\\) is close to 1 and \\(y\\) is close to 2. We can express this closeness using the Chebyshev distance, which is the maximum of the absolute differences \\(|x - 1|\\) and \\(|y - 2|\\).\n\nLet's choose \\(\\delta\\) such that \\(|x - 1| < \\delta\\) and \\(|y - 2| < \\delta\\). We will show that this choice of \\(\\delta\\) ensures \\(|f(x, y) - f(1, 2)| < \\epsilon\\).\n\nConsider the expression:\n\\[\n|x^2y - 3xy^2 + 10|.\n\\]\n\nWe can expand and approximate this around \\((1, 2)\\):\n- \\(x^2y \\approx 1^2 \\cdot 2 + 2 \\cdot 1 \\cdot (x - 1) + 1 \\cdot (y - 2) = 2 + 2(x - 1) + (y - 2)\\).\n- \\(-3xy^2 \\approx -3 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 2^2 - 6 \\cdot 1 \\cdot (y - 2) - 6 \\cdot 2 \\cdot (x - 1) = -12 - 6(y - 2) - 12(x - 1)\\).\n\nCombining these, we have:\n\\[\nf(x, y) \\approx 2 + 2(x - 1) + (y - 2) - 12 - 6(y - 2) - 12(x - 1) + 5.\n\\]\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\\[\nf(x, y) \\approx -5 + (2 - 12)(x - 1) + (1 - 6)(y - 2).\n\\]\n\nThis shows that the change in \\(f(x, y)\\) is approximately linear in terms of \\((x - 1)\\) and \\((y - 2)\\). Therefore, by choosing \\(\\delta\\) small enough, we can make the linear terms small enough to ensure that \\(|f(x, y) - f(1, 2)| < \\epsilon\\).\n\nThus, for any \\(\\epsilon > 0\\), we can find a \\(\\delta > 0\\) such that if \\(|x - 1| < \\delta\\) and \\(|y - 2| < \\delta\\), then \\(|f(x, y) - (-5)| < \\epsilon\\).

Specifically, if we have a statement of the form \"If P, then Q\" (written as \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)), the Rule of Transposition tells us that this is logically equivalent to \"If not Q, then not P\" (written as \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\)).\n\nTo understand why this is true, let's break it down:\n\n1. **Understanding the Implication \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\):** \n   - This statement means that whenever P is true, Q must also be true. The only situation where this implication would be false is if P is true and Q is false.\n\n2. **Understanding the Transposed Implication \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\):**\n   - This statement means that whenever Q is false, P must also be false. The only situation where this implication would be false is if Q is false and P is true.\n\n3. **Logical Equivalence:**\n   - For the original implication \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) to be true, we must avoid the scenario where P is true and Q is false.\n   - For the transposed implication \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) to be true, we must avoid the scenario where Q is false and P is true.\n\nNotice that these two conditions are actually the same. If P is true and Q is false, then both the original implication and the transposed implication would be false. In all other cases, both implications are true. Therefore, the two statements are logically equivalent.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - By understanding the conditions under which each implication is true or false, we see that \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) are equivalent.

The student studies 3 pages per hour, and the probability of remembering each page is 0.8. We are asked to find the derivative of the function \\( f(x) \\), which represents the probability of remembering at least \\( x \\) pages after studying for one hour.\n\n1. **Finding the Derivative of \\( f(x) \\) at \\( x = 3 \\):**\n\n   Since the student studies 3 pages per hour, the maximum number of pages he can remember is 3. The probability of remembering each page is independent, and the probability of remembering all 3 pages is \\( 0.8^3 \\). However, \\( f(x) \\) is defined as the probability of remembering at least \\( x \\) pages. \n\n   To find the derivative at \\( x = 3 \\), we need to consider how the probability changes as \\( x \\) changes. Since the student can only study 3 pages in an hour, \\( f(x) \\) is constant for \\( x \\leq 3 \\). This means the derivative of \\( f(x) \\) with respect to \\( x \\) is 0 for \\( x \\leq 3 \\), because the probability does not change as \\( x \\) increases within this range.\n\n2. **If the Derivative of \\( f(x) \\) is a Constant:**\n\n   If we assume the derivative of \\( f(x) \\) is a constant, it implies that \\( f(x) \\) is a linear function. However, given the context that the student studies a fixed number of pages (3 pages per hour), the probability function \\( f(x) \\) is not linear but rather a step function. For \\( x \\leq 3 \\), \\( f(x) \\) is constant, and for \\( x > 3 \\), \\( f(x) \\) is 0 because the student cannot remember more pages than he studies.\n\n   Therefore, the derivative of \\( f(x) \\) is 0 for all \\( x \\) because \\( f(x) \\) does not change with \\( x \\) within the range of pages the student can study in an hour. Thus, the value of the constant derivative is 0.\n\nIn conclusion, the derivative of \\( f(x) \\) at \\( x = 3 \\) is 0, and if the derivative is a constant, that constant is also 0, reflecting the fact that the probability of remembering pages does not change as \\( x \\) increases within the studied range.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instPow', and it does not have executable code\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instPow', and it does not have executable code\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instPow', and it does not have executable code\nPlease revise the proof.",

The theorem states that if a function `f(x)` is continuous on a closed interval `[a, b]`, differentiable on the open interval `(a, b)`, and if the function values at the endpoints are equal, i.e., `f(a) = f(b)`, then there must be at least one point `c` in the open interval `(a, b)` where the derivative `f'(c) = 0`.\n\nLet's break down the reasoning:\n\n1. **Continuity and Differentiability**: We are given that `f(x)` is continuous on `[a, b]` and differentiable on `(a, b)`. This means that there are no breaks, jumps, or sharp corners in the graph of `f(x)` over the interval, and the function has a well-defined tangent (slope) at every point in `(a, b)`.\n\n2. **Equal Endpoint Values**: We also know that `f(a) = f(b)`. This implies that the function starts and ends at the same height on the graph over the interval `[a, b]`.\n\n3. **Finding Maximum and Minimum**: According to the properties of continuous functions on closed intervals, `f(x)` must attain a maximum and a minimum value somewhere on `[a, b]`. Let's denote the points where these occur as `\u03be_1` and `\u03be_2`, respectively.\n\n4. **Considering Endpoints**: If both `\u03be_1` and `\u03be_2` are at the endpoints `a` and `b`, then the maximum and minimum values are the same (`f(a) = f(b)`), meaning the function is constant over `[a, b]`. In this case, the derivative `f'(x)` is zero everywhere in `(a, b)`.\n\n5. **Interior Points**: If either `\u03be_1` or `\u03be_2` is not at the endpoints, say `\u03be_1` is in the open interval `(a, b)`, then `f(x)` has a local maximum at `\u03be_1`. By the properties of differentiable functions, the derivative at a local maximum (or minimum) must be zero. Therefore, `f'(\u03be_1) = 0`.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Whether the function is constant or has a local extremum in `(a, b)`, there exists at least one point `c` in `(a, b)` where `f'(c) = 0`.\n\nThus, by considering the behavior of the function and applying the properties of continuity and differentiability, we conclude that there must be at least one point `c` in the open interval `(a, b)` where the derivative of the function is zero, as required by Rolle's Theorem.\nPrevious attempt failed with: function expected at\n  Icc\nterm has type\n  ?m.386\nfunction expected at\n  Ioo\nterm has type\n  ?m.894\nfunction expected at\n  Ioo\nterm has type\n  ?m.894\nfunction expected at\n  Ioo\nterm has type\n  x\u271d\nunsolved goals\nx\u271d\u00b9 : Sort u_1\nIcc : x\u271d\u00b9\nx\u271d : Sort u_2\nIoo : x\u271d\nf : \u211d \u2192 \u211d\na b : \u211d\nhab : a < b\nhf_cont : ContinuousOn f (sorryAx (Set \u211d) true)\nhf_diff : DifferentiableOn \u211d f (sorryAx (Set \u211d) true)\nhf_eq : f a = f b\n\u22a2 \u2203 c \u2208 ?m.3630 f a b hab hf_cont hf_diff hf_eq c, deriv f c = 0\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: function expected at\n  Icc\nterm has type\n  ?m.386\nfunction expected at\n  Ioo\nterm has type\n  ?m.894\nfunction expected at\n  Ioo\nterm has type\n  ?m.894\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: function expected at\n  Icc\nterm has type\n  ?m.386\nfunction expected at\n  Ioo\nterm has type\n  ?m.894\nfunction expected at\n  Ioo\nterm has type\n  ?m.894\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "# Informal Proof:\n\nThe problem we are dealing with involves the Rule of Transposition, which is a logical principle that allows us to infer a statement of the form \"if not Q, then not P\" from a statement of the form \"if P, then Q\". This is a fundamental rule in logic and is often used in proofs to simplify or transform statements.\n\nTo understand why this rule holds, let's break it down:\n\n1. **Understanding the Statements**: \n   - We start with the implication \"if P, then Q\". This means that whenever P is true, Q must also be true. In logical terms, this is written as \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\).\n   - The transposition of this statement is \"if not Q, then not P\", which is written as \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\).\n\n2. **Why the Transposition Holds**:\n   - Suppose the original statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is true. This means that there is no situation where P is true and Q is false simultaneously.\n   - Now consider the contrapositive \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\). This states that if Q is false, then P cannot be true. \n   - If Q is false and P were true, it would contradict our original statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) because P being true would require Q to be true as well. Therefore, if Q is false, P must also be false, which is exactly what \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) asserts.\n\n3. **Logical Equivalence**:\n   - The key idea here is that the original implication and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means that proving one is true automatically proves the other is true as well.\n   - This equivalence is a well-established result in logic and is often used to simplify proofs by allowing us to work with whichever form of the statement is more convenient.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - By understanding that the truth of \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) ensures the truth of \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), we have effectively shown why the Rule of Transposition is valid.\n   - This rule is a powerful tool in logical reasoning and is frequently used in mathematical proofs to transform statements into more manageable forms.\n\nIn summary, the Rule of Transposition allows us to confidently switch between an implication and its contrapositive, knowing that both statements are logically equivalent and thus, if one is true, so is the other.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\n'rule_of_transposition' has already been declared\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

The two points provided are (2, 3) and (4, 7). The two-point form of a line's equation is derived from the slope-intercept form, but it specifically uses the coordinates of two points on the line.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the slope of the line. The slope (m) is the change in the y-coordinates divided by the change in the x-coordinates between the two points. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n\n\\[ m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \\]\n\nSubstituting the coordinates of the points (2, 3) and (4, 7) into this formula, we get:\n\n\\[ m = \\frac{7 - 3}{4 - 2} = \\frac{4}{2} = 2 \\]\n\nSo, the slope of the line is 2.\n\nNext, we use the point-slope form of the line's equation, which is:\n\n\\[ y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) \\]\n\nWe can use either of the two points for this equation. Let's use the point (2, 3). Substituting the slope and the coordinates of the point into the equation, we have:\n\n\\[ y - 3 = 2(x - 2) \\]\n\nNow, we simplify this equation to get it into the slope-intercept form (y = mx + b):\n\n1. Distribute the slope on the right side: \n   \\[ y - 3 = 2x - 4 \\]\n\n2. Add 3 to both sides to solve for y:\n   \\[ y = 2x - 4 + 3 \\]\n\n3. Simplify the right side:\n   \\[ y = 2x - 1 \\]\n\nThus, the equation of the line passing through the points (2, 3) and (4, 7) is \\( y = 2x - 1 \\).\n\nThis equation makes sense because it reflects the slope we calculated, and if you substitute either of the original points into this equation, it holds true, confirming that both points lie on the line described by this equation.\nPrevious attempt failed with: 'slope' has already been declared\ntypeclass instance problem is stuck, it is often due to metavariables\n  AddTorsor ?m.116 ?m.117\nfailed to synthesize\n  HMul ((?m.5153 \u2192 ?m.5156) \u2192 ?m.5153 \u2192 ?m.5153 \u2192 ?m.5155) \u211d ?m.8794\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\ncannot evaluate code because 'sorryAx' uses 'sorry' and/or contains errors\ncannot evaluate code because 'sorryAx' uses 'sorry' and/or contains errors\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: 'slope' has already been declared\ntypeclass instance problem is stuck, it is often due to metavariables\n  OfNat ((?m.116 \u2192 ?m.119) \u2192 ?m.116 \u2192 ?m.116 \u2192 ?m.118) 2\nnumerals are polymorphic in Lean, but the numeral `2` cannot be used in a context where the expected type is\n  (?m.116 \u2192 ?m.119) \u2192 ?m.116 \u2192 ?m.116 \u2192 ?m.118\ndue to the absence of the instance above\nfailed to synthesize\n  HMul ((?m.8816 \u2192 ?m.8819) \u2192 ?m.8816 \u2192 ?m.8816 \u2192 ?m.8818) \u211d ?m.12457\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nunsolved goals\n\u22a2 sorryAx \u211d true = point1.2\nunsolved goals\n\u22a2 sorryAx \u211d true = point2.2\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: 'slope' has already been declared\ntypeclass instance problem is stuck, it is often due to metavariables\n  OfNat ((?m.116 \u2192 ?m.119) \u2192 ?m.116 \u2192 ?m.116 \u2192 ?m.118) 2\nnumerals are polymorphic in Lean, but the numeral `2` cannot be used in a context where the expected type is\n  (?m.116 \u2192 ?m.119) \u2192 ?m.116 \u2192 ?m.116 \u2192 ?m.118\ndue to the absence of the instance above\nfailed to synthesize\n  HMul ((?m.8816 \u2192 ?m.8819) \u2192 ?m.8816 \u2192 ?m.8816 \u2192 ?m.8818) \u211d ?m.12457\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nunsolved goals\n\u22a2 sorryAx \u211d true = point1.2\nunsolved goals\n\u22a2 sorryAx \u211d true = point2.2\ncannot evaluate code because 'sorryAx' uses 'sorry' and/or contains errors\nPlease revise the proof.",

When adding numbers, the result should be rounded to the least precise decimal place of the numbers involved. Here, 5.7 has its last significant figure in the tenths place (10^-1), and 3.2 also has its last significant figure in the tenths place (10^-1). Therefore, the sum should be rounded to the tenths place.\n\nCalculating the sum:\n5.7 + 3.2 = 8.9\n\nSince both numbers have their last significant figure in the tenths place, the result, 8.9, is already in the correct form with respect to significant figures.\n\nNext, we subtract 6.4 from 8.9.

This means that the total flux of the vector field \\( \\mathbf{F} \\) across the closed surface \\( S \\) is zero.\n\nThus, we have shown that if the divergence of a vector field is zero throughout a region, the net flux of the vector field across the boundary of that region is also zero. This conclusion aligns with the physical intuition that if there are no sources or sinks within the region (as indicated by zero divergence), the amount of \"flow\" entering the region must equal the amount leaving, resulting in a net flux of zero across the boundary.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unexpected token '\u2202'; expected ')', '_', '\u2191', '\u21a5', '\u21d1', identifier or term\nunexpected token '\u222b'; expected ',' or 'in'\nunexpected token '\u222b'; expected ',' or 'in'\nunsolved goals\ncase h\nf_1 f_2 f_3 : \u211d \u2192 \u211d \u2192 \u211d \u2192 \u211d\nF : \u211d \u2192 \u211d \u2192 \u211d \u2192 \u211d \u00d7 \u211d \u00d7 \u211d\nS : Set (\u211d \u00d7 \u211d \u00d7 \u211d)\n\u22a2 sorryAx (Sort ?u.440) true\n\nf_1 f_2 f_3 : \u211d \u2192 \u211d \u2192 \u211d \u2192 \u211d\nF : \u211d \u2192 \u211d \u2192 \u211d \u2192 \u211d \u00d7 \u211d \u00d7 \u211d\nS : Set (\u211d \u00d7 \u211d \u00d7 \u211d)\nh : sorryAx (Sort ?u.440) true\n\u22a2 flux_integral F S = 0\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unexpected token '\u2202'; expected term\nunexpected token '\u222b'; expected ',' or 'in'\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unexpected token '\u2202'; expected term\nunexpected token '\u222b'; expected ',' or 'in'\nPlease revise the proof.",

In one dimension, if \\( X \\) is a continuous random variable with a probability density function \\( f(x) \\), the expected value \\( E(X) \\) is given by the integral:\n\n\\[\nE(X) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x f(x) \\, dx\n\\]\n\nThis formula essentially weights each possible value \\( x \\) by its probability density \\( f(x) \\) and sums (integrates) these weighted values over the entire real line.\n\nNow, let's extend this idea to three dimensions. In \\( \\mathbb{R}^3 \\), the random variable \\( X \\) is described by a density function \\( F(x, y, z) \\), which is a vector field. The region \\( A \\) is the domain over which this density function is defined. The expected value \\( E(X) \\) in this context is analogous to finding the \"center of mass\" of the density distribution described by \\( F \\).\n\nTo compute \\( E(X) \\), we need to integrate the density function over the entire region \\( A \\). This is done using a triple integral, which accounts for the contribution of the density function at each point \\((x, y, z)\\) within the region \\( A \\). The triple integral is expressed as:\n\n\\[\nE(X) = \\int \\int \\int_A F(x, y, z) \\, dV\n\\]\n\nHere, \\( dV \\) represents the differential volume element in \\( \\mathbb{R}^3 \\), and the integration is performed over the entire region \\( A \\).\n\nThe reason this triple integral gives us the expected value is that it accumulates the density \\( F(x, y, z) \\) over the volume of \\( A \\), effectively summing up the contributions of all infinitesimal volume elements within \\( A \\). This is analogous to summing up the weighted values in the one-dimensional case, but now extended to three dimensions.\n\nThus, the expected value \\( E(X) \\) of the random variable \\( X \\) is indeed equivalent to the triple integral of the density function \\( F \\) over the region \\( A \\), as it captures the total \"mass\" or \"weight\" of the distribution described by \\( F \\) within \\( A \\).

Initially, John has a book priced at some original price, which we'll call \\( P \\).\n\n1. **First Price Change (Increase by 20%)**: \n   - John increases the price by 20%. To find the new price after this increase, we calculate 20% of the original price \\( P \\), which is \\( 0.2 \\times P = 0.2P \\).\n   - The new price after the increase is the original price plus this additional amount: \\( P + 0.2P = 1.2P \\).\n\n2. **Second Price Change (Decrease by 20%)**:\n   - After the sale, John decreases the price by 20% of the increased price. The increased price is \\( 1.2P \\), so 20% of this is \\( 0.2 \\times 1.2P = 0.24P \\).\n   - The price after the decrease is the increased price minus this amount: \\( 1.2P - 0.24P = 0.96P \\).\n\nNow, let's compare the final price \\( 0.96P \\) to the original price \\( P \\).\n\n3. **Difference Between Original and Final Price**:\n   - The final price \\( 0.96P \\) is less than the original price \\( P \\). The difference between the original price and the final price is \\( P - 0.96P = 0.04P \\).\n\n4. **Percentage Difference**:\n   - To find the percentage difference between the original price and the final price, we calculate what fraction of the original price this difference represents. The difference is \\( 0.04P \\), and the original price is \\( P \\).\n   - The percentage difference is given by \\( \\left(\\frac{0.04P}{P}\\right) \\times 100\\% = 4\\% \\).\n\nTherefore, the percentage of the difference between the increased price and the final price is 4%. This shows that when you increase a price by a certain percentage and then decrease it by the same percentage, you do not return to the original price, but rather end up with a lower price.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\nsimp made no progress\nsimp made no progress\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unsolved goals\nP : \u211d\nincreased_price : \u211d := 1.2 * P\nfinal_price : \u211d := 0.96 * P\ndifference : \u211d := increased_price - final_price\npercentage_difference : \u211d := difference / P * 100\n\u22a2 (6 / 5 * P - 24 / 25 * P) / P * 100 = 4\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

If \\( \\mathbf{v} = (v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_n) \\) and \\( \\mathbf{w} = (w_1, w_2, \\ldots, w_n) \\), then their sum \\( \\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{w} \\) is the vector \\( (v_1 + w_1, v_2 + w_2, \\ldots, v_n + w_n) \\).\n\n2. **Scalar Multiplication of a Vector**: When we multiply a vector by a scalar \\( c \\), we multiply each component of the vector by \\( c \\). So, for a vector \\( \\mathbf{a} = (a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n) \\), the scalar multiplication \\( c \\cdot \\mathbf{a} \\) results in the vector \\( (c \\cdot a_1, c \\cdot a_2, \\ldots, c \\cdot a_n) \\).\n\n3. **Applying Scalar Multiplication to the Sum**: Now, consider the left-hand side of our equation, \\( c \\cdot (\\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{w}) \\). Using the definition of vector addition, this becomes \\( c \\cdot (v_1 + w_1, v_2 + w_2, \\ldots, v_n + w_n) \\). Applying scalar multiplication, we get the vector \\( (c \\cdot (v_1 + w_1), c \\cdot (v_2 + w_2), \\ldots, c \\cdot (v_n + w_n)) \\).\n\n4. **Distributing the Scalar**: By the distributive property of real numbers, which states that \\( c \\cdot (a + b) = c \\cdot a + c \\cdot b \\) for any real numbers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), we can distribute the scalar \\( c \\) over each component sum. Thus, \\( c \\cdot (v_i + w_i) = c \\cdot v_i + c \\cdot w_i \\) for each component \\( i \\).\n\n5. **Resulting Vector**: Applying this to each component, the vector \\( (c \\cdot (v_1 + w_1), c \\cdot (v_2 + w_2), \\ldots, c \\cdot (v_n + w_n)) \\) becomes \\( (c \\cdot v_1 + c \\cdot w_1, c \\cdot v_2 + c \\cdot w_2, \\ldots, c \\cdot v_n + c \\cdot w_n) \\).\n\n6. **Rewriting as Two Vectors**: Notice that this is exactly the same as adding the two vectors \\( (c \\cdot v_1, c \\cdot v_2, \\ldots, c \\cdot v_n) \\) and \\( (c \\cdot w_1, c \\cdot w_2, \\ldots, c \\cdot w_n) \\), which are \\( c \\cdot \\mathbf{v} \\) and \\( c \\cdot \\mathbf{w} \\) respectively.\n\n7. **Conclusion**: Therefore, we have shown that \\( c \\cdot (\\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{w}) = c \\cdot \\mathbf{v} + c \\cdot \\mathbf{w} \\), confirming that scalar multiplication distributes over vector addition.\n\nThis completes our informal proof that scalar multiplication of vectors in \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\) obeys the distributive law.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  HSMul \u211d (\u211d ^ n) ?m.697\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nsimp made no progress\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  HSMul \u211d (\u211d ^ n) ?m.697\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nsimp made no progress\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  HSMul \u211d (\u211d ^ n) ?m.697\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nsimp made no progress\nPlease revise the proof.",

For a function \\( f: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}^2 \\), this derivative is represented by a \\( 2 \\times 2 \\) matrix.\n\nLet's consider the function \\( f(x) = Ax \\). Here, \\( x \\) is a vector in \\( \\mathbb{R}^2 \\), and \\( A \\) is a constant matrix. The function \\( f \\) is linear because it is defined as a matrix multiplication, which is a linear operation. This means that for any vectors \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) in \\( \\mathbb{R}^2 \\), and any scalar \\( c \\), the function satisfies:\n\n1. \\( f(x + y) = A(x + y) = Ax + Ay = f(x) + f(y) \\)\n2. \\( f(cx) = A(cx) = c(Ax) = cf(x) \\)\n\nSince \\( f \\) is linear, its derivative at any point \\( x \\) is simply the matrix \\( A \\) itself. This is because the best linear approximation to a linear function is the function itself. In other words, the rate of change of \\( f \\) with respect to \\( x \\) is constant and is given by the matrix \\( A \\).\n\nTo see this more explicitly, consider the definition of the derivative for functions from \\( \\mathbb{R}^2 \\) to \\( \\mathbb{R}^2 \\).

Here, \\( z \\) is a complex number and \\( i \\) is the imaginary unit.\n\nFirst, let's recall that the exponential function \\( e^{ix} \\) can be expressed using Euler's formula: \\( e^{ix} = \\cos(x) + i\\sin(x) \\). This means that \\( f(x) = z \\cdot (\\cos(x) + i\\sin(x)) \\). However, for the purpose of integration, it's often more straightforward to work directly with the exponential form.\n\nThe integral we need to evaluate is:\n\n\\[\n\\int_a^b z \\cdot e^{ix} \\, dx\n\\]\n\nSince \\( z \\) is a constant with respect to \\( x \\), we can factor it out of the integral:\n\n\\[\nz \\int_a^b e^{ix} \\, dx\n\\]\n\nNow, we focus on integrating \\( e^{ix} \\). The antiderivative of \\( e^{ix} \\) is \\(\\frac{1}{i} e^{ix}\\), because when you differentiate \\(\\frac{1}{i} e^{ix}\\) with respect to \\( x \\), you get back \\( e^{ix} \\) (since the derivative of \\( e^{ix} \\) is \\( i e^{ix} \\), and multiplying by \\(\\frac{1}{i}\\) cancels the \\( i \\)).\n\nThus, the integral becomes:\n\n\\[\nz \\left[ \\frac{1}{i} e^{ix} \\right]_a^b\n\\]\n\nThis means we evaluate the antiderivative at the bounds \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) and subtract:\n\n\\[\nz \\left( \\frac{1}{i} e^{ib} - \\frac{1}{i} e^{ia} \\right)\n\\]\n\nSimplifying this expression, we factor out \\(\\frac{1}{i}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{z}{i} \\left( e^{ib} - e^{ia} \\right)\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the integral of \\( f(x) = z \\cdot e^{ix} \\) from \\( a \\) to \\( b \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{z}{i} \\left( e^{ib} - e^{ia} \\right)\n\\]\n\nThis matches the expression we were asked to prove, confirming that our integration and reasoning are correct.

It measures how the function \\( f(x, y) \\) changes as \\( x \\) changes, while \\( y \\) is held constant.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Difference Quotient**: The expression \\(\\frac{f(x+h, y) - f(x, y)}{h}\\) is a difference quotient. It represents the average rate of change of the function \\( f \\) with respect to \\( x \\) over the interval from \\( x \\) to \\( x+h \\), while keeping \\( y \\) constant.\n\n2. **Limit as \\( h \\to 0 \\)**: We are interested in what happens to this average rate of change as the interval \\( h \\) becomes infinitesimally small. This is precisely what the partial derivative \\(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}\\) at \\((x, y)\\) captures: the instantaneous rate of change of \\( f \\) with respect to \\( x \\) at the point \\((x, y)\\).\n\n3. **Continuity of Partial Derivatives**: The problem states that the partial derivatives \\(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}\\) and \\(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}\\) exist and are continuous on \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\). This continuity is crucial because it ensures that as \\( h \\) approaches 0, the behavior of the function \\( f \\) is well-behaved and predictable.\n\n4. **Application of the Limit**: By the definition of the partial derivative, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}(x, y) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(x+h, y) - f(x, y)}{h}\n   \\]\n   This limit exists because the partial derivative is assumed to exist and be continuous. Therefore, as \\( h \\) becomes very small, the difference quotient approaches the value of the partial derivative \\(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}\\) at the point \\((x, y)\\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since the partial derivative \\(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}\\) is defined as the limit of the difference quotient as \\( h \\to 0 \\), and given the continuity of the partial derivatives, we conclude that:\n   \\[\n   \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(x+h, y) - f(x, y)}{h} = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}(x, y)\n   \\]\n   This completes the proof, showing that the limit of the difference quotient is indeed the partial derivative with respect to \\( x \\) at the point \\((x, y)\\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: invalid binder annotation, type is not a class instance\n  ?m.60\nuse the command `set_option checkBinderAnnotations false` to disable the check\ninvalid binder annotation, type is not a class instance\n  ?m.84\nuse the command `set_option checkBinderAnnotations false` to disable the check\ninvalid binder annotation, type is not a class instance\n  ?m.108\nuse the command `set_option checkBinderAnnotations false` to disable the check\nfunction expected at\n  Tendsto\nterm has type\n  ?m.134\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: invalid binder annotation, type is not a class instance\n  Continuous fun p => f (p.1, p.2)\nuse the command `set_option checkBinderAnnotations false` to disable the check\ninvalid binder annotation, type is not a class instance\n  Continuous fun p => f (p.1, p.2)\nuse the command `set_option checkBinderAnnotations false` to disable the check\ntype mismatch\n  fun h => (f (x + h, y) - f (x, y)) / h\nhas type\n  \u211d \u2192 \u211d : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u211d : Type\nfunction expected at\n  Tendsto\nterm has type\n  ?m.2101\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: invalid binder annotation, type is not a class instance\n  Continuous f_x\nuse the command `set_option checkBinderAnnotations false` to disable the check\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\nfunction expected at\n  Tendsto\nterm has type\n  ?m.897\nfunction expected at\n  Tendsto\nterm has type\n  ?m.897\nPlease revise the proof.",

A complex number \\( z \\) can be expressed in the form \\( z = a + bi \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are real numbers, and \\( i \\) is the imaginary unit with the property \\( i^2 = -1 \\). The complex conjugate of \\( z \\), denoted \\( \\overline{z} \\), is \\( a - bi \\).\n\nThe magnitude (or modulus) of a complex number \\( z = a + bi \\) is given by \\( |z| = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \\). Similarly, the magnitude of the conjugate \\( \\overline{z} = a - bi \\) is \\( |\\overline{z}| = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \\). Notice that the magnitudes of \\( z \\) and \\( \\overline{z} \\) are the same because both are calculated using the same expression \\( \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \\).\n\nNow, let's consider the product of the magnitudes of \\( z \\) and \\( \\overline{z} \\):\n\\[ |z| \\cdot |\\overline{z}| = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \\cdot \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = a^2 + b^2. \\]\n\nNext, we need to find the square of the magnitude of \\( z \\):\n\\[ |z|^2 = (\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2})^2 = a^2 + b^2. \\]\n\nWe observe that both expressions, \\( |z| \\cdot |\\overline{z}| \\) and \\( |z|^2 \\), simplify to \\( a^2 + b^2 \\).

        "informal_proof": "# Informal Proof:\n\nTo prove that multiplying any number by 1 always gives the original number, let's think about what multiplication by 1 means. Multiplication is essentially repeated addition. When we multiply a number \\( x \\) by 1, we are essentially adding \\( x \\) to itself zero additional times. In other words, we are not adding anything extra to \\( x \\), so the result should just be \\( x \\).\n\nLet's break it down further:\n\n1. **Understanding Multiplication by 1**: When you multiply a number by 1, you are asking, \"How many times should I take this number?\" Since you are multiplying by 1, you take the number exactly once. Therefore, \\( x \\times 1 \\) means you take \\( x \\) one time, which is just \\( x \\).\n\n2. **Using the Identity Property of Multiplication**: In mathematics, there is a property called the \"identity property of multiplication.\" This property states that any number multiplied by 1 remains unchanged. This is because 1 is the multiplicative identity, meaning it does not alter the value of the number it multiplies.\n\n3. **Example with Numbers**: Consider a simple example with a number, say 5. If you multiply 5 by 1, you are essentially saying, \"I have 5, and I want to take it one time.\" So, \\( 5 \\times 1 = 5 \\). This holds true for any number, whether it's 0, a positive number, a negative number, or even a fraction.\n\n4. **Generalization**: This reasoning applies to any number \\( x \\). No matter what \\( x \\) is, multiplying it by 1 means you are taking \\( x \\) exactly once, which results in \\( x \\).\n\nTherefore, for any number \\( x \\), multiplying by 1 gives us the original number back, i.e., \\( x \\times 1 = x \\). This is a fundamental property of numbers and is consistent across all types of numbers, including integers, fractions, and real numbers.",

The area \\( A \\) of a circle with radius \\( r \\) is given by the formula \\( A(r) = \\pi r^2 \\).\n\nNow, we want to find the rate of change of the area with respect to the radius, which is mathematically represented as the derivative \\( \\frac{dA}{dr} \\). To find this derivative, we differentiate the area function \\( A(r) = \\pi r^2 \\) with respect to \\( r \\).\n\nDifferentiating \\( \\pi r^2 \\) with respect to \\( r \\), we apply the power rule of differentiation. The power rule states that if you have a function of the form \\( x^n \\), its derivative is \\( nx^{n-1} \\). Applying this to \\( \\pi r^2 \\), we get:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{dA}{dr} = \\frac{d}{dr}(\\pi r^2) = 2\\pi r\n\\]\n\nThis result, \\( 2\\pi r \\), is actually the formula for the circumference of the circle. So, the rate of change of the area of the circle with respect to its radius is \\( 2\\pi r \\), which is exactly the circumference of the circle.\n\nThis shows that the rate at which the area increases as the radius increases is directly proportional to the circumference of the circle. In other words, as you increase the radius by a small amount, the increase in area is approximately the same as adding a thin ring around the circle, whose width is the small increase in radius and whose length is the circumference of the circle.\n\nThus, the derivative \\( \\frac{dA}{dr} = 2\\pi r \\) confirms that the rate of change of the area with respect to the radius is indeed proportional to the circumference of the circle.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.pi', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.denselyNormedField', and it does not have executable code\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.pi', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.pi', and it does not have executable code\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: function expected at\n  deriv\nterm has type\n  ?m.6\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

To do this, we need to have a common denominator for the fractions. The denominators here are 4 and 2. The least common denominator (LCD) of 4 and 2 is 4. \n\nSo, we rewrite 1/2 with the denominator 4. We know that 1/2 is equivalent to 2/4 because if you multiply both the numerator and the denominator of 1/2 by 2, you get 2/4. Now, we can perform the subtraction:\n\n3/4 - 1/2 becomes 3/4 - 2/4.\n\nSubtracting these fractions is straightforward because they have the same denominator. We subtract the numerators and keep the denominator the same:\n\n3/4 - 2/4 = (3 - 2)/4 = 1/4.\n\nNow, we have 1/4 after the subtraction. The next step is to add 1/2 back to this result. Again, we need a common denominator to add these fractions. We already know that 1/2 is equivalent to 2/4. So, we add:\n\n1/4 + 1/2 becomes 1/4 + 2/4.\n\nAdding these fractions, we add the numerators and keep the denominator the same:\n\n1/4 + 2/4 = (1 + 2)/4 = 3/4.\n\nAs we can see, after subtracting 1/2 from 3/4 and then adding 1/2 back, we end up with 3/4, which is the original fraction we started with. This process works because subtraction and addition are inverse operations, meaning that adding back what you subtracted will return you to your starting point.",

The formula for the sum of the first \\( n \\) terms of a geometric series is:\n\n\\[ S_n = a \\frac{r^n - 1}{r - 1} \\]\n\nThis formula arises from the pattern and structure of geometric series. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Understanding the Series**: The series given is \\( S = 2 + 2 \\cdot 3 + 2 \\cdot 3^2 + 2 \\cdot 3^3 + 2 \\cdot 3^4 + 2 \\cdot 3^5 \\). This is a geometric series where each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by the common ratio \\( r = 3 \\).\n\n2. **Applying the Formula**: We substitute the given values into the formula.

The derivative of a term \\( z^n \\) with respect to \\( z \\) is \\( n \\cdot z^{n-1} \\). Additionally, the derivative of a constant is zero, and the derivative of a term \\( az \\) where \\( a \\) is a constant is simply \\( a \\).\n\nNow, let's apply these rules to our function \\( f(z) = z^2 + 2z + 1 \\):\n\n1. **Differentiate \\( z^2 \\):**  \n   The derivative of \\( z^2 \\) is \\( 2z \\). This follows from the power rule, where the exponent 2 is brought down as a coefficient, and the new exponent becomes 1 (i.e., \\( 2 \\cdot z^{2-1} = 2z \\)).\n\n2. **Differentiate \\( 2z \\):**  \n   The derivative of \\( 2z \\) is simply 2. This is because the derivative of \\( z \\) is 1, and multiplying by the constant 2 gives us 2.\n\n3. **Differentiate the constant 1:**  \n   The derivative of a constant is 0. Therefore, the derivative of 1 is 0.\n\nCombining these results, the derivative of the function \\( f(z) = z^2 + 2z + 1 \\) is:\n\n\\[ f'(z) = 2z + 2 + 0 = 2z + 2. \\]\n\nThus, the derivative of the function \\( f(z) = z^2 + 2z + 1 \\) is \\( f'(z) = 2z + 2 \\). This result holds for any complex number \\( z \\), including \\( z = 3 + 4i \\).

This involves rearranging the equation so that all terms involving \\( y \\) are on one side and all terms involving \\( x \\) are on the other side. We can rewrite the equation as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{y} \\frac{dy}{dx} = k\n\\]\n\nNow, we integrate both sides with respect to their respective variables. The left side is integrated with respect to \\( y \\), and the right side is integrated with respect to \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\n\\int \\frac{1}{y} \\, dy = \\int k \\, dx\n\\]\n\nThe integral of \\(\\frac{1}{y}\\) with respect to \\( y \\) is \\(\\ln |y|\\), and the integral of \\( k \\) with respect to \\( x \\) is \\( kx \\). Thus, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\ln |y| = kx + C_1\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( C_1 \\) is the constant of integration. To solve for \\( y \\), we exponentiate both sides to eliminate the natural logarithm:\n\n\\[\n|y| = e^{kx + C_1}\n\\]\n\nThis can be rewritten as:\n\n\\[\n|y| = e^{C_1} e^{kx}\n\\]\n\nSince \\( e^{C_1} \\) is just a positive constant, we can denote it by \\( C \\), where \\( C \\) can be any non-zero constant (positive or negative, since we took the absolute value of \\( y \\)). Therefore, we have:\n\n\\[\ny = Ce^{kx}\n\\]\n\nThis shows that the solution to the differential equation \\(\\frac{dy}{dx} = ky\\) is indeed \\( y = Ce^{kx} \\), where \\( C \\) is an arbitrary constant. This solution makes sense because it reflects the exponential growth or decay behavior that is characteristic of such differential equations, depending on whether \\( k \\) is positive or negative.\nPrevious attempt failed with: type mismatch\n  diff_eq\nhas type\n  \u2200 (f f' : \u211d \u2192 \u211d) (k x : \u211d), f' x = k * f x : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u2200 (x : \u211d), f' x = k * f x : Prop\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  ?a * (?b / ?c)\ncase h\nf f' : \u211d \u2192 \u211d\nk : \u211d\nh : \u2200 (x : \u211d), f' x = k * f x\nx0 : \u211d\nhx0 : f x0 \u2260 0\nC : \u211d := f x0 / rexp (k * x0)\nx : \u211d\nh1 : f' x = k * f x\nh2 : f x0 \u2260 0\nh3 : rexp (k * x0) \u2260 0\n\u22a2 f x = C * rexp (k * x)\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: type mismatch\n  hx0\nhas type\n  x0 \u2260 0 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  f x0 \u2260 0 : Prop\napplication type mismatch\n  diff_eq x\nargument\n  x\nhas type\n  \u211d : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u211d \u2192 \u211d : Type\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, equality or iff proof expected\n  \u211d\nf f' : \u211d \u2192 \u211d\nk x0 : \u211d\nhx0 : x0 \u2260 0\nhf0 : f x0 \u2260 0\nC : \u211d := f x0 / rexp (k * x0)\nx : \u211d\nh1 : f' x = k * f x\nh2 : rexp (k * x0) \u2260 0\n\u22a2 f x0 = C * rexp (k * x0)\nunknown identifier 'integral_deriv_eq_sub'\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, equality or iff proof expected\n  ?m.2290\nf f' : \u211d \u2192 \u211d\nk x0 : \u211d\nhx0 : x0 \u2260 0\nhf0 : f x0 \u2260 0\nC : \u211d := f x0 / rexp (k * x0)\nx : \u211d\nh1 : f' x = k * f x\nh2 : rexp (k * x0) \u2260 0\nh3 : f x0 = C * rexp (k * x0)\n\u22a2 f x = f x0 + \u222b (t : \u211d) in x0..x, f' t\nunknown identifier 'integral_const_mul'\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, equality or iff proof expected\n  ?m.2442\nf f' : \u211d \u2192 \u211d\nk x0 : \u211d\nhx0 : x0 \u2260 0\nhf0 : f x0 \u2260 0\nC : \u211d := f x0 / rexp (k * x0)\nx : \u211d\nh1 : f' x = k * f x\nh2 : rexp (k * x0) \u2260 0\nh3 : f x0 = C * rexp (k * x0)\nh4 : f x = f x0 + \u222b (t : \u211d) in x0..x, f' t\n\u22a2 \u222b (t : \u211d) in x0..x, k * f t = k * \u222b (t : \u211d) in x0..x, f t\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  \u222b (t : \u211d) in x0..x, k * f t\ncase h\nf f' : \u211d \u2192 \u211d\nk x0 : \u211d\nhx0 : x0 \u2260 0\nhf0 : f x0 \u2260 0\nC : \u211d := f x0 / rexp (k * x0)\nx : \u211d\nh1 : f' x = k * f x\nh2 : rexp (k * x0) \u2260 0\nh3 : f x0 = C * rexp (k * x0)\nh4 : f x = f x0 + \u222b (t : \u211d) in x0..x, f' t\nh5 : \u222b (t : \u211d) in x0..x, k * f t = k * \u222b (t : \u211d) in x0..x, f t\n\u22a2 C * rexp (k * x0) + \u222b (t : \u211d) in x0..x, f' t = C * rexp (k * x)\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  f' ?x\nf f' : \u211d \u2192 \u211d\nk x\u271d : \u211d\nh h1 : \u2200 (x : \u211d), f' x = k * f x\nx0 : \u2115 := 0\nh2 : f' \u2191x0 = k * f \u2191x0\nC : \u211d := f \u2191x0 / rexp (k * \u2191x0)\nx : \u211d\nh3 : f x = f \u2191x0 + \u222b (t : \u211d) in \u2191x0..x, f' t\nh4 : \u222b (t : \u211d) in \u2191x0..x, k * f t = k * \u222b (t : \u211d) in \u2191x0..x, f t\n\u22a2 \u222b (t : \u211d) in \u2191x0..x, f' t = k * \u222b (t : \u211d) in \u2191x0..x, f t\nunsolved goals\ncase h\nf f' : \u211d \u2192 \u211d\nk x\u271d : \u211d\nh h1 : \u2200 (x : \u211d), f' x = k * f x\nx0 : \u2115 := 0\nh2 : f' \u2191x0 = k * f \u2191x0\nC : \u211d := f \u2191x0 / rexp (k * \u2191x0)\nx : \u211d\nh3 : f x = f \u2191x0 + \u222b (t : \u211d) in \u2191x0..x, f' t\nh4 : \u222b (t : \u211d) in \u2191x0..x, k * f t = k * \u222b (t : \u211d) in \u2191x0..x, f t\nh5 : \u222b (t : \u211d) in \u2191x0..x, f' t = k * \u222b (t : \u211d) in \u2191x0..x, f t\n\u22a2 f 0 + k * \u222b (t : \u211d) in 0 ..x, f t = f 0 * (rexp 0)\u207b\u00b9 * rexp (k * x)\nPlease revise the proof.",

We are given a function \\( f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R} \\) that is continuous and differentiable everywhere, with the special property that its derivative at any point \\( x \\) is equal to the function value at that point, i.e., \\( f'(x) = f(x) \\).\n\nWe are also given a parametric curve \\( \\gamma(t) = (t, f(t)) \\) in the plane, and we need to find the equation of the tangent line to this curve at a point \\( (t, f(t)) \\).\n\nFirst, let's recall what a tangent line is. The tangent line to a curve at a given point is a straight line that just \"touches\" the curve at that point and has the same direction as the curve at that point. The slope of this tangent line is given by the derivative of the function that describes the curve.\n\nIn our case, the curve is described by the parametric equations \\( x = t \\) and \\( y = f(t) \\). The slope of the tangent line at the point \\( (t, f(t)) \\) is given by the derivative of \\( y \\) with respect to \\( x \\). Since \\( x = t \\), the derivative \\( \\frac{dy}{dx} \\) is simply \\( f'(t) \\).\n\nGiven that \\( f'(t) = f(t) \\), the slope of the tangent line at the point \\( (t, f(t)) \\) is \\( f(t) \\).\n\nNow, we can use the point-slope form of the equation of a line to write the equation of the tangent line. The point-slope form is given by:\n\n\\[ y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) \\]\n\nwhere \\( (x_1, y_1) \\) is a point on the line, and \\( m \\) is the slope of the line.\n\nFor our tangent line, the point is \\( (t, f(t)) \\) and the slope is \\( f(t) \\). Substituting these into the point-slope form, we get:\n\n\\[ y - f(t) = f(t)(x - t) \\]\n\nSimplifying this equation, we have:\n\n\\[ y = f(t)(x - t) + f(t) \\]\n\nThis is the equation of the tangent line to the curve \\( \\gamma(t) = (t, f(t)) \\) at the point \\( (t, f(t)) \\).\n\nThus, we have shown that the tangent line to the curve at the point \\( (t, f(t)) \\) is indeed given by the equation \\( y = f(t) \\cdot (x - t) + f(t) \\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: invalid field notation, type is not of the form (C ...) where C is a constant\n  \u03b3 t\nhas type\n  \u211d \u2192 \u211d \u00d7 \u211d\ninvalid field notation, type is not of the form (C ...) where C is a constant\n  \u03b3 t\nhas type\n  \u211d \u2192 \u211d \u00d7 \u211d\napplication type mismatch\n  f t\nargument\n  t\nhas type\n  \u211d \u2192 \u211d : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u211d : Type\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: invalid declaration name '\u03b3', there is a section variable with the same name\ninvalid argument, variable is not a proposition or let-declaration\nsimp made no progress\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: invalid field notation, type is not of the form (C ...) where C is a constant\n  \u03b3 t\nhas type\n  \u211d \u2192 \u211d \u00d7 \u211d\ninvalid field notation, type is not of the form (C ...) where C is a constant\n  \u03b3 t\nhas type\n  \u211d \u2192 \u211d \u00d7 \u211d\napplication type mismatch\n  f t\nargument\n  t\nhas type\n  \u211d \u2192 \u211d : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u211d : Type\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "# Informal Proof:\n\nThe problem at hand involves proving the Rule of Transposition, which is a logical principle that states: if a conditional statement \"if P, then Q\" is true, then its contrapositive \"if not Q, then not P\" is also true. This rule is fundamental in logic and is often used to simplify proofs by allowing us to work with the contrapositive of a statement instead of the original statement.\n\nTo understand why this rule holds, let's break it down:\n\n1. **Understanding the Conditional Statement**: The statement \"if P, then Q\" can be understood as saying that whenever P is true, Q must also be true. In other words, there is no situation where P is true and Q is false.\n\n2. **Understanding the Contrapositive**: The contrapositive of \"if P, then Q\" is \"if not Q, then not P\". This means that if Q is false, then P must also be false. \n\n3. **Why the Contrapositive is Equivalent**: The key to understanding why the contrapositive is equivalent to the original statement lies in the structure of logical implications. If \"if P, then Q\" is true, it means that the only way for the implication to be false is if P is true and Q is false. However, since we are given that \"if P, then Q\" is true, this situation cannot occur. Therefore, if Q is false, P cannot be true, which is exactly what the contrapositive states.\n\n4. **Logical Equivalence**: In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are always logically equivalent. This means that proving one automatically proves the other. This equivalence is a fundamental property of logical implications and is widely used in mathematical proofs.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: By understanding that a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, we can confidently use the Rule of Transposition in proofs. This allows us to switch between a statement and its contrapositive as needed, often simplifying the process of proving logical implications.\n\nIn summary, the Rule of Transposition is a powerful tool in logic that allows us to work with the contrapositive of a statement, knowing that it is logically equivalent to the original statement. This equivalence is based on the structure of logical implications and is a fundamental concept in mathematical reasoning.",

Two events \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are independent if the occurrence of one does not affect the probability of the occurrence of the other. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n\n\\[\n\\Pr(A \\cap B) = \\Pr(A) \\cdot \\Pr(B)\n\\]\n\nNow, we want to find the probability of the union of \\( A \\) and \\( B \\), denoted as \\( \\Pr(A \\cup B) \\). According to the addition law of probability, the probability of the union of two events is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\Pr(A \\cup B) = \\Pr(A) + \\Pr(B) - \\Pr(A \\cap B)\n\\]\n\nThis formula accounts for the fact that when we add the probabilities of \\( A \\) and \\( B \\), we are double-counting the probability of the intersection \\( A \\cap B \\), so we need to subtract it once.\n\nSince \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are independent, we can substitute the expression for the intersection of independent events:\n\n\\[\n\\Pr(A \\cap B) = \\Pr(A) \\cdot \\Pr(B)\n\\]\n\nSubstituting this into the formula for the union, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\Pr(A \\cup B) = \\Pr(A) + \\Pr(B) - \\Pr(A) \\cdot \\Pr(B)\n\\]\n\nThis shows that the probability of the union of two independent events is indeed the sum of their individual probabilities minus the product of their probabilities. This result aligns with our understanding of how probabilities combine for independent events, ensuring that the overlap (intersection) is correctly accounted for by subtracting the product of their probabilities.

By substituting \\( x = 2 \\) into the function, we get:\n\n\\[ f(2) = 2^2 = 4. \\]\n\nNow, according to the definition of continuity at a point, a function \\( f(x) \\) is continuous at \\( x = a \\) if the limit of \\( f(x) \\) as \\( x \\) approaches \\( a \\) is equal to \\( f(a) \\).

Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[ 8x = 32 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 8:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{32}{8} = 4 \\]\n\nSo, the shorter side of the rectangle is 4 units. Since the longer side is 3 times the shorter side, we calculate:\n\n\\[ 3x = 3 \\times 4 = 12 \\]\n\nThus, the longer side of the rectangle is 12 units.\n\nIn conclusion, the lengths of the sides of the rectangle are 4 units and 12 units. This satisfies both the condition that one side is 3 times the other and that the perimeter is 32 units.\nPrevious attempt failed with: type mismatch\n  h2\nhas type\n  2 * (4 * x) = 32 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  8 * x = 32 : Prop\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: no goals to be solved\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: no goals to be solved\nPlease revise the proof.",

Specifically, the Rule of Transposition states that for any propositions \\( P \\) and \\( Q \\), the implication \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is logically equivalent to its contrapositive \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\).\n\nTo understand this, let's break it down:\n\n1. **Understanding the Implication \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\):**\n   - The statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) means \"if \\( P \\) is true, then \\( Q \\) is also true.\" In other words, whenever \\( P \\) holds, \\( Q \\) must hold as well.\n\n2. **Understanding the Contrapositive \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\):**\n   - The contrapositive of the implication \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\). This means \"if \\( Q \\) is not true, then \\( P \\) is not true either.\" In other words, if \\( Q \\) fails to hold, then \\( P \\) must also fail to hold.\n\n3. **Why are they equivalent?**\n   - The equivalence between an implication and its contrapositive is a fundamental property of logical statements. To see why they are equivalent, consider the truth values:\n     - If \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is true, then whenever \\( P \\) is true, \\( Q \\) must be true. This also means that if \\( Q \\) is false, \\( P \\) cannot be true (otherwise, it would contradict the truth of \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)).\n     - Conversely, if \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) is true, then whenever \\( Q \\) is false, \\( P \\) must also be false. This implies that if \\( P \\) were true, \\( Q \\) would have to be true as well, which is exactly what \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) states.\n\n4. **Proof Strategy:**\n   - To prove the equivalence, we need to show two things:\n     - **Forward Implication:** If \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is true, then \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) is also true.\n     - **Reverse Implication:** If \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) is true, then \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is also true.\n\n5. **Forward Implication:**\n   - Assume \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is true. We need to show that \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) holds.\n   - Suppose \\( Q \\) is false. Since \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is true, \\( P \\) cannot be true (otherwise, \\( Q \\) would have to be true). Therefore, \\( P \\) must be false, which means \\( \\neg P \\) is true. Thus, \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) holds.\n\n6. **Reverse Implication:**\n   - Assume \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) is true. We need to show that \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) holds.\n   - Suppose \\( P \\) is true. Since \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) is true, if \\( Q \\) were false, \\( P \\) would also have to be false, which contradicts our assumption that \\( P \\) is true. Therefore, \\( Q \\) must be true. Thus, \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) holds.\n\nBy demonstrating both the forward and reverse implications, we have shown that \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is logically equivalent to \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), completing the proof of the Rule of Transposition.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  h hQ\nargument\n  hQ\nhas type\n  Q : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u00acQ : Prop\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

Let's start by considering the end behavior of the polynomial. Since the leading term is \\( 2x^4 \\), which is a positive coefficient of an even power, as \\( x \\) approaches both positive and negative infinity, \\( f(x) \\) will tend to positive infinity. This suggests that the graph of the polynomial opens upwards on both ends.\n\nNext, we can look for critical points by finding the derivative of \\( f(x) \\) and setting it to zero. The derivative is:\n\n\\[ f'(x) = 8x^3 - 9x^2 - 22x + 6. \\]\n\nSolving \\( f'(x) = 0 \\) will give us the critical points, which are potential locations for local maxima, minima, or points of inflection. However, finding the exact roots of this cubic equation analytically can be complex, so instead, we can use numerical methods or graphing to approximate these points.\n\nOnce we have the critical points, we can evaluate \\( f(x) \\) at these points to determine the local minima and maxima. If all local minima are above the x-axis, and the function tends to positive infinity as \\( x \\) approaches both positive and negative infinity, then the polynomial does not cross the x-axis, indicating no real roots.\n\nAdditionally, we can use the Intermediate Value Theorem, which states that if a continuous function changes sign over an interval, it must have a root in that interval. By evaluating \\( f(x) \\) at several points, if we find that \\( f(x) \\) does not change sign, it further supports the conclusion that there are no real roots.\n\nFor instance, evaluating \\( f(x) \\) at some test points:\n\n- \\( f(0) = 30 \\)\n- \\( f(1) = 2(1)^4 - 3(1)^3 - 11(1)^2 + 6(1) + 30 = 24 \\)\n- \\( f(-1) = 2(-1)^4 - 3(-1)^3 - 11(-1)^2 + 6(-1) + 30 = 38 \\)\n\nThese evaluations show that \\( f(x) \\) is positive at these points. If similar evaluations at other points also yield positive values, it suggests that the polynomial does not cross the x-axis.\n\nIn conclusion, by analyzing the end behavior, critical points, and evaluating the polynomial at various points, we can infer that the polynomial \\( f(x) = 2x^4 - 3x^3 - 11x^2 + 6x + 30 \\) does not have any real roots.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unsolved goals\nx : \u211d\nh : f x = 0\nh1 : f 0 = 30\nh2 : f 1 = 24\n\u22a2 18 = 38\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\nx : \u211d\nh : f x = 0\nh1 : f 0 = 30\nh2 : f 1 = 24\nh3 : f (-1) = 38\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unsolved goals\nx : \u211d\nh : f x = 0\nh1 : f 0 = 30\nh2 : f 1 = 24\n\u22a2 18 = 38\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase h\nx\u271d : \u211d\nh : f x\u271d = 0\nh1 : f 0 = 30\nh2 : f 1 = 24\nh3 : f (-1) = 38\nx : \u211d\na\u271d : 0 \u2265 f x\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nfunction expected at\n  h4 x\nterm has type\n  f x > 0\nPlease revise the proof.",

We can do this by adding each digit place separately:\n\n- Start with the units place: \\(5 + 6 = 11\\).

Again, we do this by subtracting each digit place:\n\n- Start with the units place: \\(1 - 9\\) is not possible directly, so we need to borrow.

Since 602 is greater than 600, the result of adding 345 and 456 and then subtracting 199 is indeed greater than 600. Therefore, the answer to the problem is yes, the result is greater than 600.",

Mary has 1000 milliliters of juice. We want to find out how much juice each cup will have when this total amount is divided equally among 4 cups.\n\nThe operation we need to perform is dividing the total amount of juice, 1000 milliliters, by the number of cups, which is 4.

We know that 1 liter is equivalent to 1000 milliliters. Therefore, to convert milliliters to liters, we divide the number of milliliters by 1000:\n\n\\[ \\text{Juice per cup in liters} = \\frac{250 \\text{ milliliters}}{1000} \\]\n\n\\[ = 0.25 \\text{ liters} \\]\n\nThus, each cup will contain 0.25 liters of juice.

An antiderivative of \\( x^2 \\) is a function whose derivative is \\( x^2 \\). From basic calculus, we know that the antiderivative of \\( x^2 \\) is \\(\\frac{x^3}{3}\\).

The process of finding the antiderivative and evaluating it at the bounds gives us the exact area under the curve, confirming that the integral is indeed \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  NormedAddCommGroup \u2115\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  NormedSpace \u211d \u2115\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  MeasureTheory.MeasureSpace \u2115\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\ntype mismatch\n  Float.val 0.\nhas type\n  floatSpec.float : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  Set \u2115 : Type\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  NormedAddCommGroup \u2115\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  NormedSpace \u211d \u2115\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  MeasureTheory.MeasureSpace \u2115\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\ntype mismatch\n  Float.val 0.\nhas type\n  floatSpec.float : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  Set \u2115 : Type\ntactic 'apply' failed, failed to unify\n  HasDerivAt (fun x => ?c x / ?d) (?c' / ?d) ?x\nwith\n  HasDerivAt (fun x => x ^ 3 / 3) (x ^ 2) x\nx : \u211d\nhx : x \u2208 Set.Icc 0 1\n\u22a2 HasDerivAt (fun x => x ^ 3 / 3) (x ^ 2) x\napplication type mismatch\n  intervalIntegral.integral_eq_sub_of_hasDerivAt h\nargument\n  h\nhas type\n  \u2200 x \u2208 Set.Icc 0 1, HasDerivAt (fun x => x ^ 3 / 3) (x ^ 2) x : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u2200 x \u2208 Set.uIcc ?m.5746 ?m.5747, HasDerivAt ?m.5744 (?m.5745 x) x : Prop\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  \u222b (y : \u211d) in ?m.5746..?m.5747, ?m.5745 y\nh : \u2200 x \u2208 Set.Icc 0 1, HasDerivAt (fun x => x ^ 3 / 3) (x ^ 2) x\n\u22a2 \u222b (x : \u2115) in ?m.76, x ^ 2 = 1 / 3\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  NormedAddCommGroup \u2115\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  NormedSpace \u211d \u2115\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  MeasureTheory.MeasureSpace \u2115\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\ntype mismatch\n  Float.val 0.\nhas type\n  floatSpec.float : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  Set \u2115 : Type\nfailed to synthesize\n  NontriviallyNormedField \u2115\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  NormedAddCommGroup \u2115\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  NormedSpace \u2115 \u2115\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\ntactic 'apply' failed, failed to unify\n  HasDerivAt (fun x => ?c x / ?d) (?c' / ?d) ?x\nwith\n  HasDerivAt (fun x => x ^ 3 / 3) (x ^ 2) x\nx : \u2115\nhx : x \u2208 Set.Icc 0 1\n\u22a2 HasDerivAt (fun x => x ^ 3 / 3) (x ^ 2) x\nunknown identifier 'h'\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  \u222b (y : \u211d) in ?m.7786..?m.7787, ?m.7785 y\ncase refine_1\n\u22a2 \u2115 \u2192 NontriviallyNormedField \u2115\nPlease revise the proof.",

The system given is \\( \\frac{dx}{dt} = Ax \\), where \\( A \\) is a constant \\( n \\times n \\) matrix, and \\( x(t) \\) is a vector function of time. The matrix \\( X(t) \\) is constructed such that its columns are solutions to this system.\n\nThe Laplace Transform is a powerful tool for solving linear differential equations, especially when dealing with systems. The key idea is to transform the differential equation into an algebraic equation, which is often easier to solve.\n\n1. **Understanding the System**: The differential equation \\( \\frac{dx}{dt} = Ax \\) can be rewritten in matrix form as \\( X'(t) = AX(t) \\), where \\( X(t) \\) is the matrix of solutions. Each column of \\( X(t) \\) is a solution vector to the system.\n\n2. **Applying the Laplace Transform**: The Laplace Transform of a derivative, \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{X'(t)\\} \\), is given by \\( s\\mathcal{L}\\{X(t)\\} - X(0) \\), where \\( X(0) \\) is the initial condition matrix. Applying the Laplace Transform to both sides of the equation \\( X'(t) = AX(t) \\), we get:\n   \\[\n   s\\mathcal{L}\\{X(t)\\} - X(0) = A\\mathcal{L}\\{X(t)\\}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Rearranging the Equation**: We can rearrange this equation to solve for \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{X(t)\\} \\):\n   \\[\n   s\\mathcal{L}\\{X(t)\\} - A\\mathcal{L}\\{X(t)\\} = X(0)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   (sI - A)\\mathcal{L}\\{X(t)\\} = X(0)\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solving for the Laplace Transform**: To isolate \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{X(t)\\} \\), we multiply both sides by the inverse of \\( (sI - A) \\), assuming it exists:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}\\{X(t)\\} = (sI - A)^{-1}X(0)\n   \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The expression \\( (sI - A)^{-1} \\) is the Laplace Transform of the matrix \\( X(t) \\), given the initial condition \\( X(0) \\). This result shows how the Laplace Transform converts the differential equation into an algebraic form, where \\( (sI - A)^{-1} \\) acts as a transfer function that relates the initial state to the transformed state.\n\nIn summary, the Laplace Transform of the matrix \\( X(t) \\) is \\( (sI - A)^{-1} \\), which elegantly captures the behavior of the system in the frequency domain. This transformation simplifies the process of solving the system of differential equations by converting it into a problem of matrix inversion.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to infer binder type\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: invalid field notation, type is not of the form (C ...) where C is a constant\n  set\nhas type\n  ?m.263 \u2192 ?m.264 PUnit.{?u.262 + 1}\nfailed to synthesize\n  NormedAddCommGroup (Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) \u211d)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nexpected token\nunexpected token ','; expected '\u21a6', '=>'\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: function expected at\n  Ioi\nterm has type\n  ?m.225\nPlease revise the proof.",

We are given that the sample mean \\( \\bar{X} \\) is calculated from a random sample of size \\( n \\) drawn from a population with mean \\( \\mu \\) and standard deviation \\( \\sigma \\).\n\nFirst, let's recall that the sample mean \\( \\bar{X} \\) is an unbiased estimator of the population mean \\( \\mu \\). This means that the expected value of \\( \\bar{X} \\) is equal to \\( \\mu \\), as shown in the context. The proof provided in the context demonstrates that the expectation of the sample mean is indeed \\( \\mu \\) by using the linearity of expectation.\n\nNow, let's consider the distribution of \\( \\bar{X} \\). According to the Central Limit Theorem, for a sufficiently large sample size \\( n \\), the distribution of the sample mean \\( \\bar{X} \\) approaches a normal distribution with mean \\( \\mu \\) and standard deviation \\( \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} \\). This is because the sample mean is a sum of independent random variables, each with the same distribution.\n\nThe probability density function of a normal distribution is symmetric around its mean. Therefore, the pdf of \\( \\bar{X} \\), which is approximately normal, is symmetric around \\( \\mu \\). This symmetry implies that at the point \\( \\bar{X} = \\mu \\), the slope of the pdf is zero. In other words, the derivative of the pdf with respect to \\( \\bar{X} \\) is zero at \\( \\bar{X} = \\mu \\).\n\nTo summarize, the derivative of the pdf of \\( \\bar{X} \\) with respect to \\( \\bar{X} \\) is zero at \\( \\bar{X} = \\mu \\) because the pdf is symmetric around \\( \\mu \\). This symmetry results in a horizontal tangent line at the peak of the normal distribution, which occurs at the mean \\( \\mu \\). Thus, the derivative is zero at this point, confirming the statement in the problem.",

This is a classic problem of combinations, where we are selecting a subset of players from a larger group.\n\nFirst, let's identify the total number of players available for selection. Originally, there are 15 players on the team, but since one player is injured, only 14 players are available for selection. The task is to choose 11 players from these 14.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 11 players from 14 is given by the combination formula:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{14}{11} = \\binom{14}{3}\n\\]\n\nThis simplification comes from the property of combinations where \\(\\binom{n}{k} = \\binom{n}{n-k}\\). So, choosing 11 players to play is equivalent to choosing 3 players not to play.\n\nNow, let's calculate \\(\\binom{14}{3}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\binom{14}{3} = \\frac{14 \\times 13 \\times 12}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = \\frac{2184}{6} = 364\n\\]\n\nThus, there are 364 different ways to choose 11 players from the 14 available.\n\nNext, we consider the second part of the problem: the coach changes the players every 10 minutes during a 90-minute game. This means there are 9 intervals (since \\(90 \\div 10 = 9\\)) during which the coach can change the team.\n\nThe rate of change of the number of different teams the coach can choose is 0 when the number of ways to choose the team does not change. Since the number of ways to choose the team is fixed at 364 for each interval, the rate of change is 0 throughout the game. Therefore, the rate of change is 0 for all 9 intervals.\n\nIn conclusion, the coach can choose the team in 364 different ways, and the rate of change of the number of different teams the coach can choose is 0 for all 9 intervals during the game.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'choose_eq_choose_symm'\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, equality or iff proof expected\n  ?m.42\n\u22a2 choose 14 11 = 364\nunknown identifier 'choose_eq_choose_symm'\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, equality or iff proof expected\n  ?m.84\n\u22a2 choose 14 11 = 364\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'choose_eq_choose_symm'\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, equality or iff proof expected\n  ?m.42\n\u22a2 choose 14 11 = 364\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'choose_eq_choose_symm'\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, equality or iff proof expected\n  ?m.42\n\u22a2 choose 14 11 = 364\nPlease revise the proof.",

The curve represents the function values \\( f(x) \\) for each \\( x \\) in the interval \\([a, b]\\). Our goal is to find the total area between this curve, the \\( x \\)-axis, and the vertical lines at \\( x = a \\) and \\( x = b \\).\n\nTo approximate this area, we can use a method called Riemann sums. Here's how it works:\n\n1. **Divide the Interval**: First, we divide the interval \\([a, b]\\) into a number of smaller subintervals. Let's say we divide it into \\( n \\) subintervals, each of width \\(\\delta x\\). The width \\(\\delta x\\) is calculated as \\((b-a)/n\\).\n\n2. **Approximate Each Subinterval**: For each subinterval, we can approximate the area under the curve by a rectangle. The height of each rectangle is determined by the value of the function at some point within the subinterval. A common choice is to use the left endpoint, right endpoint, or the midpoint of the subinterval.\n\n3. **Sum the Areas of Rectangles**: The area of each rectangle is approximately \\( f(x_i) \\cdot \\delta x \\), where \\( x_i \\) is the chosen point in the \\( i \\)-th subinterval. By summing up the areas of all these rectangles, we get an approximation of the total area under the curve.\n\n4. **Refine the Approximation**: As we increase the number of subintervals \\( n \\), the width \\(\\delta x\\) becomes smaller, and our approximation becomes more accurate. In the limit, as \\( n \\) approaches infinity, the sum of the areas of these rectangles converges to the exact area under the curve.\n\nThis limiting process is precisely what the definite integral \\(\\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx\\) represents. It is the limit of the Riemann sums as the number of subintervals goes to infinity, capturing the exact area under the curve.\n\nSince \\( f \\) is continuous on \\([a, b]\\), it is guaranteed to be integrable, meaning this limiting process will yield a well-defined number, which is the area we are looking for.\n\nThus, the area \\( A \\) under the curve of \\( f \\) from \\( a \\) to \\( b \\) is given by the definite integral \\(\\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx\\). This integral effectively sums up an infinite number of infinitesimally small areas, providing the exact total area under the curve.\nPrevious attempt failed with: function expected at\n  Icc\nterm has type\n  ?m.386\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: function expected at\n  Icc\nterm has type\n  ?m.386\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: function expected at\n  Icc\nterm has type\n  ?m.386\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

According to the theorem mentioned in the context, the area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying one of its bases (which can be thought of as the length) by the associated altitude (which can be thought of as the width). \n\nSo, to find the area of this rectangle, we simply multiply the length by the width:\n\n- Length = 8 units\n- Width = 5 units\n\nThe area of the rectangle is therefore:\n\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\text{Length} \\times \\text{Width} = 8 \\times 5 = 40 \\text{ square units} \\]\n\nThis calculation aligns with the theorem that states the area of a rectangle is the product of its base and height.

The variance of a random variable \\( X \\), denoted as \\( \\text{Var}(X) \\), is a measure of how much the values of \\( X \\) deviate from the mean \\( \\mu \\). Mathematically, it is defined as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Var}(X) = \\mathbb{E}[(X - \\mu)^2]\n\\]\n\nThis definition directly tells us that the variance is the expected value of the squared deviations of \\( X \\) from its mean \\( \\mu \\).\n\nNow, let's consider the expression \\( \\mathbb{E}[(X - \\mu)^2] \\). This expression represents the average of the squared differences between the values of \\( X \\) and the mean \\( \\mu \\). By the definition of variance, this is exactly what variance measures. Therefore, we can see that:\n\n\\[\n\\mathbb{E}[(X - \\mu)^2] = \\text{Var}(X)\n\\]\n\nGiven that the variance \\( \\text{Var}(X) \\) is denoted as \\( \\sigma^2 \\), we can substitute this into our equation:\n\n\\[\n\\mathbb{E}[(X - \\mu)^2] = \\sigma^2\n\\]\n\nThis shows that the expected value of the squared deviation of \\( X \\) from its mean \\( \\mu \\) is indeed equal to the variance \\( \\sigma^2 \\).\n\nIn summary, the problem essentially asks us to confirm the definition of variance in terms of expected squared deviations. Since variance is defined as the expected value of these squared deviations, the statement \\( \\mathbb{E}[(X - \\mu)^2] = \\sigma^2 \\) holds true by definition. Thus, for any real number \\( t \\), this relationship remains valid, as the choice of \\( t \\) does not affect the fundamental definition of variance.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'E_X', and it does not have executable code\nThe rfl tactic failed.

The components of \\( F \\) are \\( y \\), \\(-x\\), and \\( z \\). If we look at the parameterization of the curve \\( \\mathbf{r}(t) \\), we have:\n- \\( x(t) = \\cos(t) \\)\n- \\( y(t) = \\sin(t) \\)\n- \\( z(t) = t \\)\n\nSubstituting these into \\( F \\), we get:\n- The first component of \\( F \\) becomes \\( y = \\sin(t) \\).\n- The second component becomes \\(-x = -\\cos(t) \\).\n- The third component remains \\( z = t \\).\n\nNow, let's check if \\( F \\) is a conservative vector field. A vector field is conservative if it can be expressed as the gradient of some scalar function \\( f \\), i.e., \\( F = \\nabla f \\). For \\( F = \\langle y, -x, z \\rangle \\), we need to find a function \\( f(x, y, z) \\) such that:\n- \\( \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = y \\)\n- \\( \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = -x \\)\n- \\( \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z} = z \\)\n\nLet's try to find such a function \\( f \\). Consider:\n- From \\( \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = y \\), we can integrate with respect to \\( x \\) to get \\( f(x, y, z) = xy + g(y, z) \\).\n- From \\( \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = -x \\), we differentiate \\( xy + g(y, z) \\) with respect to \\( y \\) to get \\( x + \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y} = -x \\). This implies \\( \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y} = -2x \\), which is not possible since \\( g \\) should not depend on \\( x \\).\n\nThus, \\( F \\) is not a conservative vector field because we cannot find a single scalar function \\( f \\) whose gradient matches \\( F \\).\n\nHowever, we can still evaluate the line integral directly.

This is known as the unit circle. Any point on the circumference of this circle can be described using an angle \\( x \\) measured from the positive x-axis. The coordinates of this point are \\((\\cos x, \\sin x)\\).\n\nThe key property of the unit circle is that the distance from the center of the circle to any point on its circumference is always 1, because the radius is 1.

The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Area of a rectangle} = \\text{length} \\times \\text{width} \\]\n\nFor each rectangle in our problem, the length is 20 units and the width is 10 units.

Removing one rectangle means we subtract the area of one rectangle from the total area. Since each rectangle has an area of 200 square units, the area of the remaining figure after removing one rectangle is:\n\n\\[ 800 - 200 = 600 \\text{ square units} \\]\n\nThus, the total area of the remaining figure, after removing one rectangle, is 600 square units.

The gradient of a function \\( f: V \\to \\mathbb{R} \\) at a point \\( a \\) in a vector space \\( V \\) is a vector that points in the direction of the greatest rate of increase of the function. It is composed of the partial derivatives of \\( f \\) with respect to each of the basis vectors of \\( V \\).\n\nNow, consider the directional derivative of \\( f \\) at the point \\( a \\) in the direction of a basis vector \\( v_i \\). The directional derivative gives us the rate of change of the function \\( f \\) as we move from \\( a \\) in the direction of \\( v_i \\). Mathematically, this is expressed as the dot product of the gradient of \\( f \\) at \\( a \\) and the vector \\( v_i \\).\n\nAccording to the problem, for each basis vector \\( v_i \\), the directional derivative of \\( f \\) at \\( a \\) in the direction of \\( v_i \\) is equal to the \\( i \\)-th component of the vector \\( w \\). This means that the rate of change of \\( f \\) in the direction of each basis vector is exactly captured by the corresponding component of \\( w \\).\n\nSince the gradient of \\( f \\) at \\( a \\) is composed of these directional derivatives with respect to each basis vector, it follows that the gradient must be the vector whose components are these directional derivatives. In other words, the gradient of \\( f \\) at \\( a \\) is precisely the vector \\( w \\), because \\( w \\) is defined to have components that match these directional derivatives.\n\nThus, we conclude that the gradient of \\( f \\) at the point \\( a \\) is equal to the vector \\( w \\).

The task is to add the first two numbers together and then subtract the third number from this sum.\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Addition of the First Two Numbers:**\n   - We start by adding 1234 and 5678.\n   - To do this, we align the numbers by their rightmost digits and add each column, carrying over any extra value to the next column on the left if necessary.\n   - Adding the units place: \\(4 + 8 = 12\\). We write down 2 and carry over 1.\n   - Adding the tens place: \\(3 + 7 = 10\\), plus the carried over 1 gives us 11. We write down 1 and carry over 1.\n   - Adding the hundreds place: \\(2 + 6 = 8\\), plus the carried over 1 gives us 9. We write down 9.\n   - Adding the thousands place: \\(1 + 5 = 6\\). We write down 6.\n   - So, the sum of 1234 and 5678 is 6912.\n\n2. **Subtraction of the Third Number:**\n   - Next, we subtract 3456 from the sum we just calculated, which is 6912.\n   - Again, we align the numbers by their rightmost digits and subtract each column, borrowing from the next column on the left if necessary.\n   - Subtracting the units place: \\(2 - 6\\) is not possible without borrowing, so we borrow 1 from the tens place, making it \\(12 - 6 = 6\\).\n   - Subtracting the tens place: After borrowing, we have \\(0 - 5\\), which is not possible without borrowing again. We borrow 1 from the hundreds place, making it \\(10 - 5 = 5\\).\n   - Subtracting the hundreds place: After borrowing, we have \\(8 - 4 = 4\\).\n   - Subtracting the thousands place: \\(6 - 3 = 3\\).\n   - So, the result of subtracting 3456 from 6912 is 3456.\n\nTherefore, the result of adding 1234 and 5678, and then subtracting 3456, is 3456.

Two triangles are congruent if all their corresponding sides and angles are equal. This means that if triangle ABC is congruent to triangle DEF, then the sides AB, BC, and CA of triangle ABC are equal to the sides DE, EF, and FD of triangle DEF, respectively, and the angles at corresponding vertices are also equal.\n\nNow, let's consider the transformations mentioned: rotation, reflection, and translation. These are known as rigid transformations or isometries, and they have a crucial property: they preserve distances and angles. This means that if you apply any of these transformations to a shape, the size and shape of the figure do not change, only its position or orientation might.\n\nGiven that triangle ABC is transformed into triangle DEF through such transformations, the congruence of the triangles is maintained. Specifically, since these transformations do not alter the lengths of the sides, the length of side AB in triangle ABC must be equal to the length of side DE in triangle DEF.\n\nTo see why this is true, consider each transformation:\n- **Rotation**: Rotating a triangle around a point changes its orientation but not the lengths of its sides. Thus, AB remains equal to DE.\n- **Reflection**: Reflecting a triangle over a line flips it over that line, but again, the side lengths remain unchanged. So, AB is still equal to DE.\n- **Translation**: Moving a triangle in a straight line to a new position does not affect the side lengths. Therefore, AB continues to be equal to DE.\n\nSince the transformations do not change the side lengths, and since the triangles are congruent by definition, we conclude that the length of side AB is indeed equal to the length of side DE.

When we take a sample from a population with a proportion \\( p \\), the sample proportion (let's call it \\(\\hat{p}\\)) can be approximated by a normal distribution, especially when the sample size \\( n \\) is large. This is due to the Central Limit Theorem, which tells us that the distribution of the sample proportion will be approximately normal if \\( n \\) is large enough.\n\nThe mean of this normal distribution is the population proportion \\( p = 0.7 \\). The standard deviation, often called the standard error in this context, is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Standard Deviation} = \\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the values, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Standard Deviation} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.7 \\times (1 - 0.7)}{100}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.7 \\times 0.3}{100}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.21}{100}} = \\sqrt{0.0021} \\approx 0.0458\n\\]\n\nNow, we want to find the probability that the sample proportion \\(\\hat{p}\\) is less than 0.5. To do this, we calculate the z-score for \\( x = 0.5 \\). The z-score is a measure of how many standard deviations away \\( x \\) is from the mean. It is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\nz = \\frac{x - \\text{mean}}{\\text{standard deviation}}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values we have:\n\n\\[\nz = \\frac{0.5 - 0.7}{0.0458} = \\frac{-0.2}{0.0458} \\approx -4.37\n\\]\n\nA z-score of -4.37 is quite extreme, indicating that 0.5 is far below the mean of 0.7 in terms of standard deviations. In a standard normal distribution, such a low z-score corresponds to a very small probability.\n\nTo find the exact probability, we would look up this z-score in a standard normal distribution table or use a calculator that provides cumulative probabilities for the normal distribution. A z-score of -4.37 is so far into the tail of the distribution that the probability of the sample proportion being less than 0.5 is extremely small, close to zero.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the sample proportion is less than 0.5 is nearly zero, given the population proportion of 0.7 and a sample size of 100. This makes intuitive sense because 0.5 is significantly lower than the population proportion of 0.7, and with a reasonably large sample size, the sample proportion is unlikely to deviate that much from the population proportion.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\ncompiler IR check failed at 'probability_below_z_score', error: unknown declaration 'Real.decidableLT'\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'standard_deviation', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'z', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'prob_below_x', and it does not have executable code\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown constant 'Real.stdNormalCDF'\nunsolved goals\n\u22a2 sorryAx \u211d true = 0\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: expected token\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'normalCDF', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'stdDev', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'z', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to synthesize\n  HasEquiv \u211d\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\ntype mismatch\n  rfl\nhas type\n  (0.5 - 0.7) / \u221a(0.7 * (1 - 0.7) / 100) = (0.5 - 0.7) / \u221a(0.7 * (1 - 0.7) / 100) : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  (0.5 - 0.7) / \u221a(0.7 * (1 - 0.7) / 100) = -0.2 / \u221a(0.7 * 0.3 / 100) : Prop\ntype mismatch\n  rfl\nhas type\n  -0.2 / \u221a(0.7 * 0.3 / 100) = -0.2 / \u221a(0.7 * 0.3 / 100) : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  -0.2 / \u221a(0.7 * 0.3 / 100) = -0.2 / \u221a(0.21 / 100) : Prop\ntype mismatch\n  rfl\nhas type\n  -0.2 / \u221a(0.21 / 100) = -0.2 / \u221a(0.21 / 100) : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  -0.2 / \u221a(0.21 / 100) = -0.2 / \u221a21e-4 : Prop\ntype mismatch\n  rfl\nhas type\n  -0.2 / \u221a21e-4 = -0.2 / \u221a21e-4 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  -0.2 / \u221a21e-4 = -0.2 / 458e-4 : Prop\nfailed to synthesize\n  HasEquiv \u211d\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\ninvalid 'calc' step, left-hand-side is\n  Sort ?u.4602 : Type ?u.4602\nprevious right-hand-side is\n  -0.2 / 458e-4 : \u211d\nfailed to synthesize\n  HasEquiv \u211d\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  z\nhz : z = -4.37\n\u22a2 sorryAx (Sort ?u.4634) true\nPlease revise the proof.",

This rule is fundamental in logic and is often used to simplify proofs by allowing us to work with the contrapositive of a statement instead of the original statement.\n\nTo understand why this rule holds, let's break it down:\n\n1. **Understanding the Conditional Statement**: The statement \"if P then Q\" can be understood as saying that whenever P is true, Q must also be true. In other words, there is no situation where P is true and Q is false.\n\n2. **Understanding the Contrapositive**: The contrapositive of \"if P then Q\" is \"if not Q then not P\". This means that if Q is false, then P must also be false. \n\n3. **Why the Contrapositive is Equivalent**: The key to understanding why the contrapositive is equivalent to the original statement lies in the structure of logical implications. If \"if P then Q\" is true, it means that the only way for the implication to be false is if P is true and Q is false. Therefore, if Q is false, P cannot be true, which is exactly what the contrapositive states.\n\n4. **Logical Equivalence**: In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are always logically equivalent. This means that proving one automatically proves the other. This equivalence is a fundamental property of logical implications and is widely used in mathematical proofs.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: By understanding that a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, we can confidently use the Rule of Transposition in proofs. This allows us to switch between a statement and its contrapositive as needed, often simplifying the process of proving logical implications.\n\nIn summary, the Rule of Transposition is a powerful tool in logic that allows us to work with the contrapositive of a statement, knowing that it is logically equivalent to the original statement.

Since AB and CD are parallel and have the same slope of 2, they are equidistant throughout, maintaining a constant distance of 10 units apart. The line EF, with a slope of -0.5, intersects these parallel lines at points E and F.\n\nThe key to solving this problem is to use the concept of the perpendicular distance between parallel lines. The distance between two parallel lines is the shortest distance between them, which is along a line perpendicular to both. In this case, the distance is given as 10 units.\n\nNow, let's consider the slopes. The slope of AB and CD is 2, which means these lines rise 2 units for every 1 unit they run horizontally. The line EF, with a slope of -0.5, descends 0.5 units for every 1 unit it runs horizontally. The negative slope indicates that EF is slanting in the opposite direction compared to AB and CD.\n\nTo find the length of EF, we can use the fact that the distance between the parallel lines is 10 units. Since EF intersects both lines, it forms a right triangle with the segment connecting the points of intersection on AB and CD. The vertical leg of this triangle is the distance between the lines, which is 10 units.\n\nThe slope of EF, -0.5, gives us the ratio of the vertical change to the horizontal change. For every 1 unit of horizontal change, there is a 0.5 unit of vertical change. However, since we are interested in the total length of EF, we need to consider the entire vertical distance of 10 units.\n\nTo find the horizontal distance (the base of the right triangle), we use the slope of EF. If the vertical change is 10 units, then the horizontal change is 10 / 0.5 = 20 units. This is because the slope is the ratio of vertical change to horizontal change, so a vertical change of 10 units corresponds to a horizontal change of 20 units.\n\nFinally, we use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of EF. The length of EF is the hypotenuse of the right triangle with legs of 10 units (vertical) and 20 units (horizontal). According to the Pythagorean theorem, the length of EF is:\n\nEF = \u221a(10^2 + 20^2) = \u221a(100 + 400) = \u221a500 = 10\u221a5.\n\nTherefore, the length of line EF is 10\u221a5 units.\nPrevious attempt failed with: no goals to be solved\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: no goals to be solved\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: no goals to be solved\nPlease revise the proof.",

The girl has 3/4 of a chocolate bar, and the boy has 1/2 of a chocolate bar.\n\nWhen adding fractions, it's important to have a common denominator. The denominators here are 4 and 2. The least common multiple of 4 and 2 is 4, so we will use 4 as the common denominator.\n\nThe girl's portion is already expressed with the denominator 4, so we don't need to change it. It remains 3/4.\n\nFor the boy's portion, which is 1/2, we need to convert it to have the denominator 4. To do this, we multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 2. This gives us:\n\n1/2 = (1 \u00d7 2) / (2 \u00d7 2) = 2/4.\n\nNow, both fractions have the same denominator, and we can add them directly:\n\n3/4 + 2/4.\n\nTo add these fractions, we simply add the numerators while keeping the denominator the same:\n\n3 + 2 = 5.\n\nSo, 3/4 + 2/4 = 5/4.\n\nThe result, 5/4, means they have 5 parts of chocolate, each part being 1/4 of a chocolate bar. This can also be expressed as 1 whole chocolate bar and 1/4 of another chocolate bar.\n\nTherefore, together, the girl and the boy have 1 and 1/4 chocolate bars.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

This rule is fundamental in logic and is often used to simplify proofs by allowing us to work with the contrapositive of a statement instead of the original statement.\n\nTo understand why this rule holds, let's break it down:\n\n1. **Understanding the Conditional Statement**: The statement \"if P, then Q\" can be understood as saying that whenever P is true, Q must also be true. In other words, there is no situation where P is true and Q is false.\n\n2. **Understanding the Contrapositive**: The contrapositive of \"if P, then Q\" is \"if not Q, then not P\". This means that if Q is false, then P must also be false. \n\n3. **Why the Contrapositive is Equivalent**: To see why these two statements are equivalent, consider the following:\n   - If \"if P, then Q\" is true, then there cannot be a case where P is true and Q is false. This directly implies that if Q is false, P cannot be true, which is exactly what the contrapositive states.\n   - Conversely, if \"if not Q, then not P\" is true, then whenever Q is false, P must also be false. This means there cannot be a situation where P is true and Q is false, which is precisely what \"if P, then Q\" asserts.\n\n4. **Logical Equivalence**: The equivalence of a statement and its contrapositive is a well-known result in logic. It relies on the fact that both statements cover the same logical possibilities: they both rule out the scenario where P is true and Q is false.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Therefore, proving the original statement \"if P, then Q\" is logically equivalent to proving its contrapositive \"if not Q, then not P\". This equivalence allows us to use whichever form is more convenient for a given proof.\n\nIn summary, the Rule of Transposition is a powerful tool in logical reasoning, allowing us to switch between a statement and its contrapositive, knowing that they are logically equivalent. This can simplify proofs and make them more intuitive by focusing on the negations of the original conditions.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

The cone's base coincides with the base of the cylinder, and its apex is at the center of the top face of the cylinder.\n\nFirst, let's visualize the setup. We have a cylinder with a circular base of radius \\( r \\) and height \\( h \\). The cone is perfectly inscribed in this cylinder, meaning its base is the same circle as the base of the cylinder, and its apex is directly above the center of this circle, at the top face of the cylinder.\n\nThe key to finding the apex angle of the cone is to consider a vertical cross-section of the cylinder and cone. This cross-section will be a triangle, with the base of the triangle being the diameter of the cylinder's base, and the apex of the triangle being the apex of the cone.\n\nThe base of this triangle is the diameter of the cylinder's base, which is \\( 2r \\). The height of the triangle is the height of the cylinder, which is \\( h \\). This triangle is isosceles because the cone is symmetric about its vertical axis.\n\nThe apex angle of the cone, which is the angle at the top of this isosceles triangle, can be found using trigonometry. Specifically, we can use the tangent function, which relates the angle to the opposite side and the adjacent side in a right triangle. However, since we are dealing with an isosceles triangle, we can split it into two right triangles by drawing a line from the apex to the midpoint of the base.\n\nEach of these right triangles will have:\n- One leg as \\( r \\) (half of the base, since the base is \\( 2r \\)),\n- The other leg as \\( h \\) (the height of the triangle).\n\nThe tangent of half the apex angle, \\(\\theta/2\\), is given by the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side in one of these right triangles:\n\\[\n\\tan(\\theta/2) = \\frac{r}{h}\n\\]\n\nTo find the full apex angle \\(\\theta\\), we use the arctangent function:\n\\[\n\\theta = 2 \\cdot \\arctan\\left(\\frac{r}{h}\\right)\n\\]\n\nThus, the angle at the apex of the cone, in terms of the radius \\( r \\) and the height \\( h \\) of the cylinder, is \\( 2 \\cdot \\arctan\\left(\\frac{r}{h}\\right) \\).

Specifically, for two solutions \\( y_1(x) \\) and \\( y_2(x) \\) of the given homogeneous second order linear differential equation, the Wronskian is defined as:\n\n\\[ W(y_1, y_2) = y_1(x)y_2'(x) - y2(x)y1'(x). \\]\n\nThe problem asks us to show that this Wronskian is either always zero or never zero on the interval \\( I \\).\n\nFirst, let's consider the differential equation:\n\n\\[ y'' + p(x)y' + q(x)y = 0, \\]\n\nwhere \\( p(x) \\) and \\( q(x) \\) are continuous functions on the interval \\( I \\). The solutions \\( y_1(x) \\) and \\( y_2(x) \\) are particular solutions to this equation.\n\nThe key to understanding the behavior of the Wronskian lies in its derivative. By applying the product rule to the Wronskian, we find:\n\n\\[ W'(y_1, y_2) = y_1(x)y_2''(x) - y_2(x)y_1''(x). \\]\n\nSince both \\( y_1(x) \\) and \\( y_2(x) \\) satisfy the original differential equation, we can substitute \\( y_1'' \\) and \\( y_2'' \\) from the equation:\n\n\\[ y_1'' = -p(x)y_1' - q(x)y_1, \\]\n\\[ y_2'' = -p(x)y_2' - q(x)y_2. \\]\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for \\( W' \\), we get:\n\n\\[ W'(y_1, y_2) = y_1(-p(x)y_2' - q(x)y_2) - y_2(-p(x)y_1' - q(x)y_1). \\]\n\nSimplifying this, we find:\n\n\\[ W'(y_1, y_2) = -p(x)(y_1y_2' - y_2y_1') = -p(x)W(y_1, y_2). \\]\n\nThis is a first-order linear differential equation for the Wronskian:\n\n\\[ W' = -p(x)W. \\]\n\nThe solution to this type of differential equation is given by:\n\n\\[ W(x) = C e^{-\\int p(x) \\, dx}, \\]\n\nwhere \\( C \\) is a constant.

This rule is fundamental in logic and is often used to simplify proofs by allowing us to work with the contrapositive of a statement instead of the original statement.\n\nTo understand why this rule holds, let's break it down:\n\n1. **Understanding the Conditional Statement**: The statement \"if P, then Q\" can be understood as saying that whenever P is true, Q must also be true. In other words, there are no cases where P is true and Q is false.\n\n2. **Understanding the Contrapositive**: The contrapositive of \"if P, then Q\" is \"if not Q, then not P\". This means that whenever Q is false, P must also be false. In other words, there are no cases where Q is false and P is true.\n\n3. **Why the Rule Holds**: The key to understanding why the rule of transposition holds is to recognize that both the original statement and its contrapositive describe the same set of circumstances. If \"if P, then Q\" is true, it means that the only possible scenarios are either both P and Q are true, or P is false (regardless of Q). This directly implies that if Q is false, P cannot be true, which is exactly what the contrapositive states.\n\n4. **Logical Equivalence**: The logical equivalence between a statement and its contrapositive is a well-established principle in logic. This equivalence means that proving one automatically proves the other. Therefore, if we can establish the truth of \"if P, then Q\", we have simultaneously established the truth of \"if not Q, then not P\".\n\nIn summary, the Rule of Transposition is valid because the truth of a conditional statement inherently guarantees the truth of its contrapositive. This is due to the logical structure of implications and the way truth values are assigned in logic. By understanding the relationship between a statement and its contrapositive, we can confidently use this rule in logical reasoning and proofs.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

We have a power series \\( \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n x^n \\) that converges absolutely for all \\( x \\) in the interval \\((-R, R)\\). Absolute convergence is a strong form of convergence that ensures the series behaves nicely, allowing us to perform operations like differentiation term by term.\n\nThe key idea here is that if a power series converges absolutely within some interval, then it can be differentiated term by term within that interval. This is a well-known result in the theory of power series and is analogous to the theorem about differentiating uniformly convergent series of functions.\n\nNow, let's differentiate the series term by term. The function \\( f(x) \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ f(x) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n x^n. \\]\n\nTo find the derivative \\( f'(x) \\), we differentiate each term of the series with respect to \\( x \\):\n\n- The derivative of \\( a_0 \\) (the constant term) is 0.\n- The derivative of \\( a_1 x \\) is \\( a_1 \\).\n- The derivative of \\( a_2 x^2 \\) is \\( 2 a_2 x \\).\n- In general, the derivative of \\( a_n x^n \\) is \\( n a_n x^{n-1} \\).\n\nThus, the derivative of the entire series is:\n\n\\[ f'(x) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} n a_n x^{n-1}. \\]\n\nNotice that the series for \\( f'(x) \\) starts at \\( n=1 \\) because the derivative of the \\( n=0 \\) term is zero.\n\nThe reason we can differentiate term by term is due to the absolute convergence of the original series. Absolute convergence ensures that the series of derivatives \\( \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} n a_n x^{n-1} \\) also converges for all \\( x \\) in \\((-R, R)\\).\n\nTherefore, by the properties of power series and the absolute convergence condition, we have shown that the derivative of \\( f(x) \\) is indeed given by the series \\( f'(x) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} n a_n x^{n-1} \\) for all \\( x \\) in the interval \\((-R, R)\\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

We also need to assess whether the length of AB can be less than or equal to 5.\n\nFirst, let's recall the definition of the sine function in a right triangle. The sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the hypotenuse. In triangle ABC, angle A is opposite side BC, and the hypotenuse is side AB. Therefore, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\sin A = \\frac{\\text{opposite side}}{\\text{hypotenuse}} = \\frac{BC}{AB}\n\\]\n\nGiven that \\(\\sin A = 0.5\\) and \\(BC = 10\\), we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n0.5 = \\frac{10}{AB}\n\\]\n\nTo find AB, we solve for it by multiplying both sides of the equation by AB and then dividing by 0.5:\n\n\\[\nAB = \\frac{10}{0.5} = 20\n\\]\n\nThus, the length of side AB is 20.\n\nNow, let's consider the hypothesis that the length of AB is less than or equal to 5.

In this context, we are dealing with a straightforward geometric calculation rather than a statistical test. Since our calculation shows that AB is 20, which is not less than or equal to 5, we can confidently reject the hypothesis without needing to consider a significance level.\n\nIn conclusion, the length of side AB is 20, and we can reject the hypothesis that it is less than or equal to 5.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.sin', and it does not have executable code\nambiguous, possible interpretations \n  \u03c0 : \u2115 \u2192 \u2115\n  \n  \u03c0 : \u211d\nambiguous, possible interpretations \n  _root_.sin A : \u211d\n  \n  A.sin : \u211d\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown constant 'Real.sin'\nunsolved goals\nA : \u211d\nAB : \u2115\nBC : \u211d\nh : sin A = 0.5\nhBC : BC = 10\n\u22a2 1 / 2 = 10 / \u2191AB\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  sin A\nA : \u211d\nAB : \u2115\nBC : \u211d\nh : sin A = 0.5\nhBC : BC = 10\nh1 : sin A = BC / \u2191AB\n\u22a2 \u2191AB = BC / 0.5\ntype mismatch\n  h2\nhas type\n  \u2191AB = 20 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  AB = 20 : Prop\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown constant 'Real.sin'\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "# Informal Proof:\n\nTo understand the problem, let's first recall the formula for the slope of the regression line in a simple linear regression model. The slope, denoted as 'm', is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ m = \\frac{\\text{cov}(x, y)}{\\text{var}(x)} \\]\n\nwhere \\(\\text{cov}(x, y)\\) is the covariance between the independent variable \\(x\\) and the dependent variable \\(y\\), and \\(\\text{var}(x)\\) is the variance of the independent variable \\(x\\).\n\nNow, let's consider what happens when we multiply every value in set A (the independent variable \\(x\\)) by a constant factor \\(k\\). This transformation results in a new set of values, which we can denote as \\(x' = kx\\).\n\nFirst, let's examine how this transformation affects the variance of \\(x\\). The variance of a set of values is defined as the average of the squared deviations from the mean. If we multiply each value in \\(x\\) by \\(k\\), the variance of the new set \\(x'\\) becomes:\n\n\\[ \\text{var}(x') = \\text{var}(kx) = k^2 \\cdot \\text{var}(x) \\]\n\nThis is because each deviation from the mean is also multiplied by \\(k\\), and when squared, this results in a factor of \\(k^2\\).\n\nNext, let's consider the covariance between the new set \\(x'\\) and the original set \\(y\\). The covariance is defined as the average of the products of the deviations of each pair of values from their respective means. When we multiply each value in \\(x\\) by \\(k\\), the covariance becomes:\n\n\\[ \\text{cov}(x', y) = \\text{cov}(kx, y) = k \\cdot \\text{cov}(x, y) \\]\n\nThis is because each deviation of \\(x\\) from its mean is multiplied by \\(k\\), affecting the product of deviations by a factor of \\(k\\).\n\nNow, we can calculate the new slope \\(m_{\\text{new}}\\) using the transformed values:\n\n\\[ m_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{\\text{cov}(x', y)}{\\text{var}(x')} = \\frac{k \\cdot \\text{cov}(x, y)}{k^2 \\cdot \\text{var}(x)} \\]\n\nSimplifying this expression, we find:\n\n\\[ m_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{k}{k^2} \\cdot \\frac{\\text{cov}(x, y)}{\\text{var}(x)} = \\frac{1}{k} \\cdot m \\]\n\nHowever, this result seems to contradict the statement we are trying to prove. Let's re-evaluate the problem statement. The problem states that the new slope should be \\(k\\) times the original slope, not \\(\\frac{1}{k}\\) times. This suggests a misunderstanding in the problem setup or the interpretation of the transformation.\n\nUpon closer inspection, the problem statement might be intended to convey that the transformation affects the dependent variable \\(y\\) instead, or there might be a misinterpretation in the problem's context. If the transformation affects \\(y\\) instead, the slope would indeed be scaled by \\(k\\).\n\nIn conclusion, the problem as stated seems to have a discrepancy, but the mathematical reasoning shows that multiplying the independent variable by \\(k\\) results in the slope being scaled by \\(\\frac{1}{k}\\), not \\(k\\). If the problem intended a different transformation, such as affecting \\(y\\), the result would align with the statement.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\n'slope' has already been declared\nfailed to synthesize\n  Field (List \u211d)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\napplication type mismatch\n  slope x'\nargument\n  x'\nhas type\n  List \u211d : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  List \u211d \u2192 ?m.2335 : Type ?u.2331\nfailed to synthesize\n  Field (List \u211d)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\napplication type mismatch\n  slope x\nargument\n  x\nhas type\n  List \u211d : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  List \u211d \u2192 ?m.4921 : Type ?u.4917\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\n'slope' has already been declared\nfailed to synthesize\n  Field (List \u211d)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  Field (List \u211d)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\napplication type mismatch\n  slope x\nargument\n  x\nhas type\n  List \u211d : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  List \u211d \u2192 ?m.3415 : Type ?u.3411\nunexpected token 'let'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: 'slope' has already been declared\nfailed to synthesize\n  Field (List \u211d)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  Field (List \u211d)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\napplication type mismatch\n  slope x\nargument\n  x\nhas type\n  List \u211d : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  List \u211d \u2192 ?m.1185 : Type ?u.1181\nunexpected token 'let'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

For a rectangle, the opposite sides are equal in length. Therefore, the garden has two sides that are each 15 feet long and two sides that are each 10 feet long.\n\nTo find the perimeter, we add the lengths of all four sides:\n\n1.

This theorem connects the concept of differentiation with that of integration and provides a powerful tool for evaluating definite integrals.\n\nFirst, let's recall what it means for \\( F(x) \\) to be an antiderivative of \\( f(x) \\). This means that the derivative of \\( F(x) \\) with respect to \\( x \\) is \\( f(x) \\), or in other words, \\( F'(x) = f(x) \\).\n\nThe Fundamental Theorem of Calculus states that if \\( F(x) \\) is an antiderivative of \\( f(x) \\) on the interval \\([a, b]\\), then the definite integral of \\( f(x) \\) from \\( a \\) to \\( b \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx = F(b) - F(a)\n\\]\n\nIn our problem, we are given that \\( F(a) = 0 \\). Therefore, substituting this into the equation from the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx = F(b) - F(a) = F(b) - 0 = F(b)\n\\]\n\nThus, the definite integral from \\( a \\) to \\( b \\) of \\( f(x) \\, dx \\) is simply \\( F(b) \\), which is consistent with the statement we wanted to prove. The condition \\( F(a) = 0 \\) simplifies the expression \\( F(b) - F(a) \\) to just \\( F(b) \\), confirming that the integral evaluates to the change in the antiderivative from \\( a \\) to \\( b \\).\n\nIn summary, by applying the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus and using the given condition \\( F(a) = 0 \\), we have shown that the definite integral from \\( a \\) to \\( b \\) of \\( f(x) \\, dx \\) equals \\( F(b) - F(a) \\), which simplifies to \\( F(b) \\).

Here, \\( m \\) is the slope of the line, and \\( b \\) is the y-intercept. The slope \\( m \\) tells us how steep the line is, and it is the same for any point on the line. The y-intercept \\( b \\) is the point where the line crosses the y-axis.\n\nNow, let's modify the equation by replacing \\( x \\) with \\( (x + 1) \\). This gives us the new equation:\n\n\\[ y = m(x + 1) + b. \\]\n\nLet's expand this equation to see what it looks like:\n\n\\[ y = mx + m \\cdot 1 + b = mx + m + b. \\]\n\nNotice that the new equation \\( y = mx + (m + b) \\) has the same slope \\( m \\) as the original equation. The only thing that has changed is the y-intercept, which is now \\( m + b \\) instead of \\( b \\).\n\nThe key point here is that the slope of the line has not changed. Since the slope \\( m \\) is the same in both the original and the new equation, the two lines are parallel. In geometry, two lines are parallel if they have the same slope, meaning they rise and run at the same rate and will never intersect.\n\nTherefore, by replacing \\( x \\) with \\( (x + 1) \\), we have effectively shifted the line horizontally by 1 unit to the left, but the direction and steepness of the line remain unchanged. This horizontal shift does not affect the parallelism of the lines, as parallelism is determined solely by the slope.\n\nIn conclusion, the new line described by \\( y = m(x + 1) + b \\) is parallel to the original line \\( y = mx + b \\) because they both have the same slope \\( m \\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

In simpler terms, as \\( x \\) gets closer to \\( c \\), \\( f(x) \\) gets closer to \\( f(c) \\).\n\nNow, let's consider the limit definition. The statement \\(\\lim_{x \\to c} f(x) = f(c)\\) means that as \\( x \\) approaches \\( c \\), the values of \\( f(x) \\) approach \\( f(c) \\). This is essentially the same condition as continuity at \\( c \\).\n\nTo see why these are equivalent, assume \\( f \\) is continuous at \\( c \\). By definition, for every \\( \\epsilon > 0 \\), there exists a \\( \\delta > 0 \\) such that if \\( 0 < |x - c| < \\delta \\), then \\( |f(x) - f(c)| < \\epsilon \\). This directly matches the definition of the limit, which states that for every \\( \\epsilon > 0 \\), there exists a \\( \\delta > 0 \\) such that if \\( 0 < |x - c| < \\delta \\), then \\( |f(x) - f(c)| < \\epsilon \\). Therefore, the limit of \\( f(x) \\) as \\( x \\) approaches \\( c \\) is indeed \\( f(c) \\).\n\nIn summary, the condition for continuity at a point \\( c \\) ensures that the function behaves nicely as \\( x \\) approaches \\( c \\), making the limit of \\( f(x) \\) as \\( x \\) approaches \\( c \\) equal to \\( f(c) \\). This is why continuity at a point implies that the limit of the function at that point equals the function's value at that point.\nPrevious attempt failed with: function expected at\n  Iic\nterm has type\n  ?m.135\nfunction expected at\n  Ici\nterm has type\n  ?m.173\nunknown identifier 'Iic_subset_Iic_self'\nunknown identifier 'Ici_subset_Ici_self'\ninvalid field notation, type is not of the form (C ...) where C is a constant\n  ContinuousAt\nhas type\n  (?m.3482 \u2192 ?m.3483) \u2192 ?m.3482 \u2192 Prop\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  TopologicalSpace \u211d\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  TopologicalSpace \u211d\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  TopologicalSpace \u211d\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfunction expected at\n  Iic\nterm has type\n  ?m.33\nfunction expected at\n  Ici\nterm has type\n  ?m.72\nfailed to rewrite using equation theorems for 'ContinuousAt'\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown namespace 'Topology'\nunexpected token '*'; expected '}'\nunexpected token '*'; expected '}'\nPlease revise the proof.",

The definite integral will give us the net area, which means it will account for areas above the x-axis as positive and areas below the x-axis as negative.\n\n1. **Identify the Integral**: We need to compute the integral \\(\\int_{-1}^{2} (3x^3 - 4x + 2) \\, dx\\).\n\n2. **Find the Antiderivative**: The antiderivative of \\( f(x) = 3x^3 - 4x + 2 \\) is found by integrating each term separately:\n   - The antiderivative of \\( 3x^3 \\) is \\(\\frac{3}{4}x^4\\).\n   - The antiderivative of \\(-4x\\) is \\(-2x^2\\).\n   - The antiderivative of \\(2\\) is \\(2x\\).\n\n   So, the antiderivative of \\( f(x) \\) is \\(\\frac{3}{4}x^4 - 2x^2 + 2x\\).\n\n3. **Evaluate the Definite Integral**: We now evaluate this antiderivative from \\( x = -1 \\) to \\( x = 2 \\):\n   - First, substitute \\( x = 2 \\) into the antiderivative: \n     \\[\n     \\frac{3}{4}(2)^4 - 2(2)^2 + 2(2) = \\frac{3}{4}(16) - 8 + 4 = 12 - 8 + 4 = 8\n     \\]\n   - Next, substitute \\( x = -1 \\) into the antiderivative:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{3}{4}(-1)^4 - 2(-1)^2 + 2(-1) = \\frac{3}{4}(1) - 2(1) - 2 = \\frac{3}{4} - 2 - 2 = \\frac{3}{4} - 4 = -\\frac{13}{4}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Net Area**: The definite integral is the difference between these two evaluations:\n   \\[\n   8 - \\left(-\\frac{13}{4}\\right) = 8 + \\frac{13}{4} = \\frac{32}{4} + \\frac{13}{4} = \\frac{45}{4}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Interpret the Result**: The result \\(\\frac{45}{4}\\) represents the net area between the curve and the x-axis from \\( x = -1 \\) to \\( x = 2 \\).

When you multiply a number by 10, you are essentially increasing its value by a factor of 10, which is the same as shifting all its digits one place to the left in the decimal system. For example, multiplying 3.5 by 10 gives 35, which is the same as moving the decimal point one place to the right.\n\nNow, let's extend this idea to multiplying by \\(10^n\\). The expression \\(10^n\\) represents the number 1 followed by \\(n\\) zeros. For instance, \\(10^2 = 100\\), \\(10^3 = 1000\\), and so on. When you multiply a number by \\(10^n\\), you are effectively multiplying it by 1 followed by \\(n\\) zeros, which shifts all the digits of the original number \\(n\\) places to the left. This is equivalent to moving the decimal point \\(n\\) places to the right.\n\nLet's look at a specific example to make this clearer. Suppose we have the number 4.56 and we want to multiply it by \\(10^2\\) (which is 100). Multiplying 4.56 by 100 gives us 456. This result is the same as moving the decimal point in 4.56 two places to the right, transforming it into 456.\n\nThis pattern holds for any natural number \\(n\\). If you start with a number \\(x\\) and multiply it by \\(10^n\\), you are effectively moving the decimal point \\(n\\) places to the right. This is because each multiplication by 10 shifts the digits one place to the left, and doing this \\(n\\) times results in the decimal point moving \\(n\\) places to the right.\n\nIn summary, multiplying a number by \\(10^n\\) is equivalent to moving the decimal point \\(n\\) places to the right because each multiplication by 10 shifts the digits one place to the left, and repeating this process \\(n\\) times achieves the desired shift of the decimal point.",

However, the expression \\( a_n = n^2 - 2n + 3 \\) is a quadratic function, not a linear one. In a quadratic function, the term \\( n^2 \\) dominates as \\( n \\) becomes large, and this term is responsible for the curvature of the graph.\n\nIn the context of regression, the \"slope\" usually refers to the coefficient of the linear term, which in this case is the coefficient of \\( n \\). Here, the linear term is \\(-2n\\), and its coefficient is \\(-2\\). This means that if we were to consider only the linear part of the expression, the slope would be \\(-2\\), which is negative.\n\nHowever, because the sequence is quadratic, the behavior of the sequence is primarily determined by the \\( n^2 \\) term as \\( n \\) becomes large. The positive coefficient of \\( n^2 \\) (which is 1) indicates that the sequence will grow without bound as \\( n \\) increases, meaning the sequence diverges to infinity. The negative linear term \\(-2n\\) affects the rate of growth but does not change the overall direction of the sequence's growth.\n\nIn summary, while the linear term has a negative coefficient, indicating a negative slope if considered in isolation, the sequence itself is dominated by the quadratic term, which causes the sequence to increase indefinitely. Therefore, the sequence diverges to infinity, and the negative slope of the linear term does not prevent this divergence.\nPrevious attempt failed with: no goals to be solved\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  Neg \u2115\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nsimp made no progress\nno goals to be solved\nno goals to be solved\nPlease revise the proof.",

The formula for three sets is:\n\n\\[\n\\card{A \\cup B \\cup C} = \\card{A} + \\card{B} + \\card{C} - \\card{A \\cap B} - \\card{A \\cap C} - \\card{B \\cap C} + \\card{A \\cap B \\cap C}\n\\]\n\nHowever, the problem does not provide information about the number of students who like two or all three fruits.

The minimum number of students is the maximum of the individual set sizes, which is 40 (since at least 40 students like cherries). The maximum number of students is the sum of all individual set sizes, which is 25 + 35 + 40 = 100, assuming no overlap.\n\nThus, without further information, the total number of students who like at least one of the fruits is between 40 and 100.

The derivative of the exponential function \\( e^t \\) with respect to \\( t \\) is well-known to be \\( e^t \\). This is because the exponential function is unique in that its rate of change (derivative) is the same as its value. Therefore, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{dy}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}(e^t) = e^t\n\\]\n\nNow, let's compare this result with the right-hand side of the differential equation \\(\\frac{dy}{dt} = y\\).

More formally, there exist real numbers \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) such that:\n\n\\[\nf(x, y) = f(x_0, y_0) + A(x - x_0) + B(y - y_0) + \\epsilon(x, y)\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\epsilon(x, y)\\) is a function that goes to zero faster than the distance \\(\\sqrt{(x - x_0)^2 + (y - y_0)^2}\\) as \\((x, y)\\) approaches \\((x_0, y_0)\\). This means that:\n\n\\[\n\\lim_{(x, y) \\to (x_0, y_0)} \\frac{\\epsilon(x, y)}{\\sqrt{(x - x_0)^2 + (y - y_0)^2}} = 0\n\\]\n\nNow, let's consider the partial derivative with respect to \\( x \\) at \\((x_0, y_0)\\). The partial derivative \\(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}(x_0, y_0)\\) is defined as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}(x_0, y_0) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(x_0 + h, y_0) - f(x_0, y_0)}{h}\n\\]\n\nUsing the differentiability condition, we substitute \\( f(x_0 + h, y_0) \\) into the expression:\n\n\\[\nf(x_0 + h, y_0) = f(x_0, y_0) + A \\cdot h + B \\cdot 0 + \\epsilon(x_0 + h, y_0)\n\\]\n\nThus, the expression for the partial derivative becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{f(x_0 + h, y_0) - f(x_0, y_0)}{h} = \\frac{A \\cdot h + \\epsilon(x_0 + h, y_0)}{h} = A + \\frac{\\epsilon(x_0 + h, y_0)}{h}\n\\]\n\nAs \\( h \\to 0 \\), the term \\(\\frac{\\epsilon(x_0 + h, y_0)}{h}\\) goes to zero because \\(\\epsilon(x_0 + h, y_0)\\) goes to zero faster than \\( h \\). Therefore, the limit exists and equals \\( A \\), which means the partial derivative with respect to \\( x \\) exists and is equal to \\( A \\).\n\nSimilarly, for the partial derivative with respect to \\( y \\), we consider:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}(x_0, y_0) = \\lim_{k \\to 0} \\frac{f(x_0, y_0 + k) - f(x_0, y_0)}{k}\n\\]\n\nUsing the differentiability condition:\n\n\\[\nf(x_0, y_0 + k) = f(x_0, y_0) + A \\cdot 0 + B \\cdot k + \\epsilon(x_0, y_0 + k)\n\\]\n\nThe expression for the partial derivative becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{f(x_0, y_0 + k) - f(x_0, y_0)}{k} = \\frac{B \\cdot k + \\epsilon(x_0, y_0 + k)}{k} = B + \\frac{\\epsilon(x_0, y_0 + k)}{k}\n\\]\n\nAs \\( k \\to 0 \\), the term \\(\\frac{\\epsilon(x_0, y_0 + k)}{k}\\) goes to zero, so the limit exists and equals \\( B \\). Thus, the partial derivative with respect to \\( y \\) exists and is equal to \\( B \\).\n\nIn conclusion, if \\( f \\) is differentiable at \\((x_0, y_0)\\), then both partial derivatives \\(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}(x_0, y_0)\\) and \\(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}(x_0, y_0)\\) exist, and they are the coefficients \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) from the linear approximation of \\( f \\) at that point.\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  HasFDerivAt f fun p => (?m.1230 p, ?m.1231 p)\nargument\n  fun p => (?m.1230 p, ?m.1231 p)\nhas type\n  (p : \u211d \u00d7 \u211d) \u2192 ?m.1228 p \u00d7 ?m.1229 p : Type (max ?u.1222 ?u.1223)\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u211d \u00d7 \u211d \u2192L[?m.876] \u211d : Type\nfunction expected at\n  partialDeriv\nterm has type\n  ?m.870\nfunction expected at\n  partialDeriv\nterm has type\n  ?m.870\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  HasFDerivAt f fun p => (?m.1230 p, ?m.1231 p)\nargument\n  fun p => (?m.1230 p, ?m.1231 p)\nhas type\n  (p : \u211d \u00d7 \u211d) \u2192 ?m.1228 p \u00d7 ?m.1229 p : Type (max ?u.1222 ?u.1223)\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u211d \u00d7 \u211d \u2192L[?m.876] \u211d : Type\nfunction expected at\n  partialDeriv\nterm has type\n  ?m.870\nfunction expected at\n  partialDeriv\nterm has type\n  ?m.870\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  HasFDerivAt f fun p => (?m.1230 p, ?m.1231 p)\nargument\n  fun p => (?m.1230 p, ?m.1231 p)\nhas type\n  (p : \u211d \u00d7 \u211d) \u2192 ?m.1228 p \u00d7 ?m.1229 p : Type (max ?u.1222 ?u.1223)\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u211d \u00d7 \u211d \u2192L[?m.876] \u211d : Type\nfunction expected at\n  partialDeriv\nterm has type\n  ?m.870\nfunction expected at\n  partialDeriv\nterm has type\n  ?m.870\nfunction expected at\n  partialDeriv\nterm has type\n  x\u271d\nfunction expected at\n  partialDeriv\nterm has type\n  x\u271d\nunsolved goals\nf : \u211d \u00d7 \u211d \u2192 \u211d\nx\u2080 y\u2080 : \u211d\nhf : DifferentiableAt \u211d f (x\u2080, y\u2080)\nx\u271d : Sort u_1\npartialDeriv : x\u271d\n\u22a2 HasFDerivAt f (sorryAx (\u211d \u00d7 \u211d \u2192L[?m.5746] \u211d) true) (x\u2080, y\u2080)\nPlease revise the proof.",

Substitute \\( x = 3 \\) into the polynomial:\n   \\[\n   p(3) = 3^2 - 5 \\times 3 + 6\n   \\]\n\n2. Calculate each term:\n   - \\( 3^2 = 9 \\)\n   - \\( 5 \\times 3 = 15 \\)\n\n3. Substitute these values back into the expression:\n   \\[\n   p(3) = 9 - 15 + 6\n   \\]\n\n4. Simplify the expression:\n   \\[\n   p(3) = 9 - 15 + 6 = 0\n   \\]\n\nSince \\( p(3) = 0 \\), \\( x = 3 \\) is also a root of the polynomial.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that the polynomial \\( p(x) = x^2 - 5x + 6 \\) has roots at \\( x = 2 \\) and \\( x = 3 \\). This means that when the polynomial is evaluated at these points, the result is zero, confirming that they are indeed the roots.",

This means that John is starting with a negative balance of $2.5$ dollars.\n\nNext, John gains $1 \\frac{2}{3}$ dollars. To work with this more easily, we convert this mixed number into a decimal. $1 \\frac{2}{3}$ is equivalent to $1 + \\frac{2}{3}$. The fraction $\\frac{2}{3}$ is approximately $0.6667$ in decimal form. So, $1 \\frac{2}{3}$ dollars is approximately $1.6667$ dollars.\n\nNow, we need to combine these two amounts to find the net result. Since John starts with a loss of $2.5$ dollars and then gains $1.6667$ dollars, we can calculate his net gain or loss by adding these two amounts together:\n\n- Start with a loss of $2.5$ dollars (which is negative, so we consider it as $-2.5$).\n- Add the gain of $1.6667$ dollars.\n\nThe calculation is: \n\\[ -2.5 + 1.6667 = -0.8333 \\]\n\nThe result, $-0.8333$, indicates that John still has a net loss.

We have two bases, B and C, for a vector space V. A basis is essentially a set of vectors that can be used to express any vector in the space uniquely as a linear combination of these basis vectors.\n\nWhen we talk about the coordinate vector [x]B of a vector x with respect to the basis B, we mean the unique set of coefficients (or scalars) that, when multiplied with the basis vectors of B and summed, give us the vector x. Similarly, [x]C is the coordinate vector of x with respect to the basis C.\n\nThe change of basis matrix P from B to C is a special matrix that allows us to convert the coordinate vector of x from one basis to another. Specifically, it transforms the coordinates of x from the basis B to the basis C.\n\nHere's how it works: The matrix P is constructed such that its columns are the coordinate vectors of the basis vectors of B expressed in terms of the basis C. In other words, each column of P tells us how to express one of the basis vectors of B using the basis vectors of C.\n\nNow, let's see why [x]C = P[x]B for any vector x in V. \n\n1. Start with the vector x expressed in terms of the basis B: x = a1v1 + a2v2 + ... + anvn, where a1, a2, ..., an are the coordinates of x with respect to B, i.e., [x]B = (a1, a2, ..., an).\n\n2. The change of basis matrix P is designed to convert these coordinates into the coordinates with respect to the basis C. When we multiply P by [x]B, we are essentially applying a linear transformation that re-expresses the vector x in terms of the new basis C.\n\n3. The result of this multiplication, P[x]B, gives us the coordinates of x with respect to the basis C, which is exactly [x]C.\n\nTherefore, the change of basis matrix P effectively transforms the coordinate vector of x from the basis B to the basis C, confirming that [x]C = P[x]B for any vector x in V. This is the essence of what a change of basis matrix does, and it is why the statement holds true.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'inner_product'\nunknown identifier 'inner_product'\nunknown identifier 'inner_product'\nunknown identifier 'inner_product'\nunexpected token '['; expected ':=', '_', 'rec' or identifier\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown constant 'Basis.ofVectorSpaceChangeMatrix'\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown constant 'Basis.ofVectorSpaceChangeMatrix'\nunknown constant 'Basis.ofVectorSpaceChangeMatrix'\nfailed to synthesize\n  Finite \u2191(Basis.ofVectorSpaceIndex \u211d V)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  Finite \u2191(Basis.ofVectorSpaceIndex \u211d V)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nunknown constant 'Basis.ofVectorSpaceChangeMatrix'\nsimp made no progress\nPlease revise the proof.",

This is because mass is additive, and removing a part of the cube means subtracting the mass of that part from the total mass.\n\nLet's calculate:\n\n- **Original Mass**: The original mass of the metal cube is 20 grams.\n- **Mass of Removed Cube**: The mass of the smaller cube that is removed is 7 grams.\n\nTo find the mass of the remaining metal cube, we subtract the mass of the removed cube from the original mass:\n\n\\[ \\text{Mass of Remaining Cube} = \\text{Original Mass} - \\text{Mass of Removed Cube} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Mass of Remaining Cube} = 20 \\, \\text{grams} - 7 \\, \\text{grams} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Mass of Remaining Cube} = 13 \\, \\text{grams} \\]\n\nTherefore, the mass of the remaining metal cube is 13 grams. This straightforward subtraction gives us the answer, as the problem involves simple arithmetic based on the given masses.\nPrevious attempt failed with: type of theorem 'remaining_cube_mass' is not a proposition\n  \u211d\nunknown constant 'remaining_cube_mass'\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'calc'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: type of theorem 'remainingCubeMass' is not a proposition\n  \u211d\ninvalid argument, variable is not a proposition or let-declaration\nsimp made no progress\nPlease revise the proof.",

The area of \\( R \\) is simply the product of its length and width, which is \\( l \\times w \\).\n\nNow, we perform a transformation on this rectangle.

The coefficients of this linear combination form the coordinate vector.\n\n2. **Existence of the Matrix \\( A \\)**:\n   - Since both \\( B_1 = \\{v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_n\\} \\) and \\( B_2 = \\{w_1, w_2, \\ldots, w_n\\} \\) are bases for \\( V \\), each vector in \\( V \\) can be uniquely expressed as a linear combination of the vectors in \\( B_1 \\) and also as a linear combination of the vectors in \\( B_2 \\).\n   - For each basis vector \\( w_i \\) in \\( B_2 \\), we can express it as a linear combination of the vectors in \\( B_1 \\).

Let's start by understanding the given setup.\n\nWe have a rectangle ABCD with sides AB = a and BC = b. The area of this rectangle is simply the product of its sides, which is \\( a \\times b \\).\n\nNow, we are given a new line segment AE such that AE = AB + BC, which means AE = a + b. We need to find the area of triangle ABE and show that it is half of the area of rectangle ABCD.\n\nFirst, let's consider the position of point E. Since AE = a + b, point E must lie on the extension of line AB beyond point B, or on the extension of line AD beyond point D, depending on how we visualize the rectangle. For simplicity, let's assume E is on the extension of line AB beyond B.\n\nNow, let's calculate the area of triangle ABE. The base of this triangle is AB, which is a. To find the height, we need to drop a perpendicular from point E to line AB. Since E is on the extension of AB, the height of triangle ABE is the same as the height of rectangle ABCD, which is the length of side BC, or b.\n\nThe area of triangle ABE is given by the formula for the area of a triangle: \\(\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}\\). Here, the base is a and the height is b, so the area of triangle ABE is \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times a \\times b\\).\n\nNow, let's compare this with the area of rectangle ABCD, which we found to be \\( a \\times b \\).

This essentially means that \\( B \\) is the inverse of \\( A \\).\n\nFirst, let's recall what it means for a matrix to be invertible. A matrix \\( A \\) is invertible if there exists a matrix \\( B \\) such that \\( AB = BA = I \\), where \\( I \\) is the identity matrix. For a 2x2 matrix, a key condition for invertibility is that the determinant of \\( A \\) is non-zero.\n\nGiven that the determinant of \\( A \\) is non-zero, we can conclude that \\( A \\) is indeed invertible. This is because the determinant being non-zero ensures that the matrix does not collapse the space into a lower dimension, which would make it impossible to reverse the transformation.\n\nNow, let's consider the transformation of vector \\( v \\) by matrix \\( A \\). In polar coordinates, this transformation can be thought of as a combination of scaling and rotating the vector \\( v \\) to produce the vector \\( w \\). Since \\( A \\) is invertible, there exists a matrix \\( B \\) such that applying \\( B \\) to \\( w \\) will reverse this scaling and rotation, bringing us back to the original vector \\( v \\).\n\nThe matrix \\( B \\) is precisely the inverse of \\( A \\), denoted as \\( A^{-1} \\). From the context provided, we know that the inverse of a matrix can be calculated using the adjugate matrix and the reciprocal of the determinant. Specifically, for a 2x2 matrix \\( A = \\begin{bmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{bmatrix} \\), the inverse \\( A^{-1} \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\nA^{-1} = \\frac{1}{\\det(A)} \\begin{bmatrix} d & -b \\\\ -c & a \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\det(A) = ad - bc\\).\n\nSince \\(\\det(A) \\neq 0\\), we can compute \\( A^{-1} \\) using the formula above. Applying \\( A^{-1} \\) to \\( w \\) will yield the original vector \\( v \\), thus proving that the transformation by \\( A \\) can indeed be inverted.\n\nIn summary, because the determinant of \\( A \\) is non-zero, \\( A \\) is invertible, and there exists a matrix \\( B = A^{-1} \\) that can transform \\( w \\) back to \\( v \\).

The null hypothesis (\\(H_0\\)) is that the new teaching method has no effect, meaning the mean score of the students remains 80. The alternative hypothesis (\\(H_a\\)) is that the new teaching method has a positive effect, meaning the mean score is greater than 80.\n\nGiven:\n- Population mean (\\(\\mu\\)) = 80\n- Population standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)) = 10\n- Sample mean (\\(\\bar{x}\\)) = 85\n- Sample size (\\(n\\)) = 30\n- Significance level (\\(\\alpha\\)) = 0.05\n\nSince the sample size is 30, which is reasonably large, we can use the Central Limit Theorem to assume that the sampling distribution of the sample mean is approximately normal. The standard deviation of the sampling distribution (standard error) is calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Standard Error (SE)} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} = \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{30}} \\approx 1.83\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the z-score to determine how many standard errors the sample mean is away from the population mean:\n\n\\[\nz = \\frac{\\bar{x} - \\mu}{\\text{SE}} = \\frac{85 - 80}{1.83} \\approx 2.73\n\\]\n\nNow, we compare this z-score to the critical value for a one-tailed test at the 0.05 significance level. The critical z-value for \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) in a one-tailed test is approximately 1.645.\n\nSince the calculated z-score of 2.73 is greater than the critical z-value of 1.645, we have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis. This means that the observed increase in the mean score to 85 is statistically significant at the 0.05 level, suggesting that the new teaching method likely has a positive effect on the students' test scores.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  HasEquiv \u211d\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nunsolved goals\n\u03bc : \u2115 := 80\n\u03c3 : \u2115 := 10\nx_bar : \u2115 := 85\nn : \u2115 := 30\n\u03b1 : Float := 5e-2\nSE : \u211d := \u2191\u03c3 / \u221a\u2191n\nz_score : \u211d := (\u2191x_bar -

The row sums are \\( 7 \\) and \\( 9 \\), while the vector sum components are \\( 11 \\) and \\( 5 \\). Clearly, these do not match directly.\n\nHowever, the problem might be asking us to consider the total sum of the vector components and the total sum of the row sums. Let's calculate these:\n\n- Total sum of vector components: \\( 11 + 5 = 16 \\)\n- Total sum of row sums: \\( 7 + 9 = 16 \\)\n\nHere, we see that the total sum of the vector components matches the total sum of the row sums. This suggests that while the individual components do not match the row sums directly, their total sums do.\n\nFinally, let's calculate the Chi-square statistic for the table. The Chi-square statistic is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\chi^2 = \\sum \\frac{(O - E)^2}{E}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( O \\) is the observed frequency, and \\( E \\) is the expected frequency. However, without additional information on expected frequencies, we cannot compute the Chi-square statistic directly. Typically, expected frequencies are calculated based on the marginal totals and the grand total, but this requires more context.\n\nIn conclusion, while the individual vector components do not match the row sums, their total sums do match. This observation aligns with the problem's requirement to show a relationship between the vector sum and the row sums of the table.\nPrevious attempt failed with: The rfl tactic failed.

The particle's motion is described by parametric equations, which are functions of time.\n\nFirst, let's understand the given information:\n- The radius of the circle, \\( r \\), is 5 units.\n- The constant speed of the particle, \\( s \\), is 10 units per second.\n- We need to find the position of the particle at \\( t = 2 \\) seconds.\n\nThe problem states that the parametric equations for the particle's motion are:\n\\[ x = r \\cos(\\omega t) \\]\n\\[ y = r \\sin(\\omega t) \\]\n\nHere, \\( \\omega \\) is the angular velocity of the particle. According to the context, the angular velocity \\( \\omega \\) is given by the formula:\n\\[ \\omega = \\frac{s}{r} \\]\n\nSubstituting the given values for \\( s \\) and \\( r \\):\n\\[ \\omega = \\frac{10}{5} = 2 \\text{ radians per second} \\]\n\nNow, we have the angular velocity \\( \\omega = 2 \\). We can use this to find the position of the particle at \\( t = 2 \\) seconds.\n\nSubstitute \\( r = 5 \\), \\( \\omega = 2 \\), and \\( t = 2 \\) into the parametric equations:\n\\[ x = 5 \\cos(2 \\times 2) = 5 \\cos(4) \\]\n\\[ y = 5 \\sin(2 \\times 2) = 5 \\sin(4) \\]\n\nTo find the exact coordinates, we need to calculate the values of \\( \\cos(4) \\) and \\( \\sin(4) \\). These are trigonometric functions evaluated at 4 radians. Using a calculator or trigonometric tables, we find:\n- \\( \\cos(4) \\approx -0.653 \\)\n- \\( \\sin(4) \\approx -0.757 \\)\n\nThus, the coordinates of the particle at \\( t = 2 \\) seconds are approximately:\n\\[ x = 5 \\times (-0.653) = -3.265 \\]\n\\[ y = 5 \\times (-0.757) = -3.785 \\]\n\nTherefore, the position of the particle at \\( t = 2 \\) seconds is approximately \\((-3.265, -3.785)\\).

Since \\( c \\) is within the interval \\([a, b]\\), the area from \\( a \\) to \\( c \\) is just a part of the total area from \\( a \\) to \\( b \\).\n\nBecause \\( f(x) \\) is non-negative, the area from \\( a \\) to \\( c \\) cannot exceed the total area from \\( a \\) to \\( b \\). In other words, the area under the curve from \\( a \\) to \\( c \\) is a subset of the area from \\( a \\) to \\( b \\). Therefore, it must be that:\n\n\\[\n\\int_a^c f(x) \\, dx \\leq \\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx = A\n\\]\n\nThis inequality holds because the integral from \\( a \\) to \\( c \\) only accumulates the area up to \\( c \\), and since \\( c \\leq b \\), it cannot include any area beyond \\( b \\).\n\nThus, we have shown that for any \\( c \\) in the interval \\([a, b]\\), the integral \\(\\int_a^c f(x) \\, dx\\) is indeed less than or equal to the total area \\( A \\) under the curve from \\( a \\) to \\( b \\).

The chain rule states that if you have a function \\( g(x) = h(u(x)) \\), then the derivative \\( g'(x) \\) is given by \\( h'(u(x)) \\cdot u'(x) \\).\n\nIn our case, the function \\( f(x) = e^{2x} \\) can be seen as a composition of two functions: the exponential function \\( h(u) = e^u \\) and the linear function \\( u(x) = 2x \\). According to the chain rule, we first differentiate the outer function \\( h(u) = e^u \\) with respect to \\( u \\), which gives us \\( h'(u) = e^u \\). Then, we differentiate the inner function \\( u(x) = 2x \\) with respect to \\( x \\), which gives us \\( u'(x) = 2 \\).\n\nNow, applying the chain rule, the derivative of \\( f(x) = e^{2x} \\) is:\n\n\\[ f'(x) = h'(u(x)) \\cdot u'(x) = e^{2x} \\cdot 2 = 2e^{2x}. \\]\n\nThis result shows that the derivative of \\( f(x) = e^{2x} \\) is \\( 2e^{2x} \\).\n\nNext, we need to solve the differential equation \\( \\frac{df}{dx} = 2f \\). We have already found that \\( \\frac{df}{dx} = 2e^{2x} \\), and we know that \\( f(x) = e^{2x} \\). Substituting \\( f(x) = e^{2x} \\) into the differential equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 2e^{2x} = 2f. \\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[ 2e^{2x} = 2e^{2x}, \\]\n\nwhich is clearly true. Therefore, the function \\( f(x) = e^{2x} \\) satisfies the differential equation \\( \\frac{df}{dx} = 2f \\).\n\nIn summary, by using the chain rule, we found that the derivative of \\( f(x) = e^{2x} \\) is \\( 2e^{2x} \\), and we verified that this function satisfies the given differential equation.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.exp', and it does not have executable code\ncompiler IR check failed at 'f'', error: unknown declaration 'Real.exp'\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.exp', and it does not have executable code\ncompiler IR check failed at 'f'', error: unknown declaration 'Real.exp'\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.exp', and it does not have executable code\ncompiler IR check failed at 'f'', error: unknown declaration 'Real.exp'\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "# Informal Proof:\n\nTo understand why the volume of a right circular cone is given by the formula \\( V = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2 h \\), we can use a method known as the Method of Disks, which is a technique from calculus used to find the volume of a solid of revolution.\n\nImagine a right circular cone with a base radius \\( r \\) and height \\( h \\). If we were to slice this cone horizontally into very thin disks (or circular slices), each disk would have a small thickness and a certain radius. The idea is to calculate the volume of each of these disks and then sum them up to get the total volume of the cone.\n\n1. **Setting Up the Problem:**\n   - Consider the cone standing upright with its apex at the origin of a coordinate system, and its base parallel to the x-axis at \\( x = h \\).\n   - The radius of each disk at a particular height \\( x \\) is proportional to \\( x \\). Specifically, the radius \\( R(x) \\) of a disk at height \\( x \\) is given by the linear function \\( R(x) = \\frac{r}{h} x \\). This is because the radius increases linearly from 0 at the apex to \\( r \\) at the base.\n\n2. **Volume of a Disk:**\n   - The volume of a thin disk at height \\( x \\) with thickness \\( \\Delta x \\) is approximately the area of the disk times its thickness. The area of a disk is \\( \\pi (R(x))^2 \\), so the volume of a disk is \\( \\pi \\left(\\frac{r}{h} x\\right)^2 \\Delta x \\).\n\n3. **Integrating to Find Total Volume:**\n   - To find the total volume of the cone, we sum up the volumes of all these disks from the apex (at \\( x = 0 \\)) to the base (at \\( x = h \\)). This is done by integrating the volume of the disks:\n     \\[\n     V = \\pi \\int_0^h \\left(\\frac{r}{h} x\\right)^2 \\, dx\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying the integrand, we have:\n     \\[\n     V = \\pi \\int_0^h \\frac{r^2}{h^2} x^2 \\, dx\n     \\]\n   - The constant \\( \\frac{r^2}{h^2} \\) can be factored out of the integral:\n     \\[\n     V = \\pi \\frac{r^2}{h^2} \\int_0^h x^2 \\, dx\n     \\]\n\n4. **Evaluating the Integral:**\n   - The integral \\( \\int_0^h x^2 \\, dx \\) is a standard power integral, which evaluates to \\( \\frac{x^3}{3} \\) from 0 to \\( h \\):\n     \\[\n     \\int_0^h x^2 \\, dx = \\left[\\frac{x^3}{3}\\right]_0^h = \\frac{h^3}{3}\n     \\]\n   - Substituting this back into the expression for \\( V \\), we get:\n     \\[\n     V = \\pi \\frac{r^2}{h^2} \\cdot \\frac{h^3}{3} = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2 h\n     \\]\n\nThus, the volume of the cone is indeed \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2 h \\), as required. This result makes intuitive sense because a cone can be thought of as a pyramid with a circular base, and the factor of \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) is consistent with the volume formula for pyramids.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown namespace 'Real'\nexpected token\nunknown constant 'CoeFun'\nunknown constant 'sorryAx'\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: function expected at\n  volume\nterm has type\n  ?m.8\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

The limit of a function as \\( x \\) approaches a particular value is the value that the function's output gets closer to as \\( x \\) gets closer to that particular value.\n\nLet's consider the function \\( f(x) = x^3 \\). We want to find out what happens to \\( f(x) \\) as \\( x \\) gets closer and closer to 2. \n\n1. **Substitution Approach**: The simplest way to start is by directly substituting \\( x = 2 \\) into the function. If we do this, we get:\n   \\[\n   f(2) = 2^3 = 8\n   \\]\n   This suggests that as \\( x \\) approaches 2, \\( f(x) \\) approaches 8.\n\n2. **Behavior Near the Point**: To further confirm this, let's consider values of \\( x \\) that are very close to 2, both from the left (values slightly less than 2) and from the right (values slightly more than 2). For example:\n   - If \\( x = 1.9 \\), then \\( f(1.9) = (1.9)^3 = 6.859 \\).\n   - If \\( x = 2.1 \\), then \\( f(2.1) = (2.1)^3 = 9.261 \\).\n\n   As \\( x \\) gets closer to 2 from either side, the value of \\( f(x) \\) gets closer to 8. This is consistent with our substitution result.\n\n3. **Mathematical Definition of Limit**: According to the formal definition of a limit, for every small positive number \\( \\epsilon \\), there exists a small positive number \\( \\delta \\) such that if \\( 0 < |x - 2| < \\delta \\), then \\( |f(x) - 8| < \\epsilon \\). In simpler terms, we can make \\( f(x) \\) as close to 8 as we want by choosing \\( x \\) sufficiently close to 2.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since both direct substitution and the behavior of the function around \\( x = 2 \\) support that \\( f(x) \\) approaches 8, we conclude that the limit of \\( f(x) = x^3 \\) as \\( x \\) approaches 2 is indeed 8.\n\nThus, we have shown through substitution, checking values around the point, and understanding the definition of a limit that the limit of \\( f(x) = x^3 \\) as \\( x \\) approaches 2 is 8.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  AddGroup \u2115\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  AddGroup \u2115\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  AddGroup \u2115\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  |?m.21381 - ?m.21382| < ?m.21383\ncase right.intro\n\u03b5 : \u2115\n\u03b5_pos : \u03b5 > 0\nx : \u2115\nhx1 : 0 < |x - 2|\nhx2 : |x - 2| = 0\n\u22a2 |x ^ 3 - 8| < \u03b5\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: function expected at\n  Tendsto\nterm has type\n  ?m.3\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: function expected at\n  Tendsto\nterm has type\n  ?m.3\nunknown identifier 'Metric.tendsto_nhds_within_nhds'\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, equality or iff proof expected\n  ?m.536\nx\u271d : Sort u_1\nTendsto : x\u271d\n\u22a2 sorryAx (Sort u_2) true\nPlease revise the proof.",

It is a first-order linear differential equation, which can be solved using the method of separation of variables. The equation \\(\\frac{dy}{dx} = -2y\\) suggests that the rate of change of \\(y\\) with respect to \\(x\\) is proportional to the value of \\(y\\) itself, with a proportionality constant of \\(-2\\).\n\nTo separate the variables, we rewrite the equation as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{dy}{y} = -2 \\, dx\n\\]\n\nNow, we integrate both sides.

The modulus of \\( z \\), denoted as \\( |z| \\), is defined as the distance from the origin to the point \\( (a, b) \\) in the complex plane. Mathematically, this is given by:\n\n\\[ |z| = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}. \\]\n\nThe problem asks us to consider \\( y = |z|^2 \\). Squaring the modulus, we have:\n\n\\[ y = (|z|)^2 = (\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2})^2 = a^2 + b^2. \\]\n\nNow, let's analyze this expression. The equation \\( y = a^2 + b^2 \\) is a quadratic equation in terms of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\). If we fix one of these variables, say \\( b \\), and let \\( a \\) vary, the equation \\( y = a^2 + b^2 \\) becomes:\n\n\\[ y = a^2 + \\text{constant}, \\]\n\nwhere the constant is \\( b^2 \\). This is the equation of a parabola opening upwards in the \\( a \\)-\\( y \\) plane, with its vertex at the point \\( (0, b^2) \\).\n\nSimilarly, if we fix \\( a \\) and let \\( b \\) vary, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ y = \\text{constant} + b^2, \\]\n\nwhere the constant is \\( a^2 \\). This is also a parabola, but in the \\( b \\)-\\( y \\) plane, with its vertex at \\( (0, a^2) \\).\n\nThus, the graph of \\( y = |z|^2 = a^2 + b^2 \\) is a surface in three-dimensional space that, when intersected by planes parallel to the \\( a \\)-\\( y \\) or \\( b \\)-\\( y \\) planes, reveals parabolic cross-sections. This confirms that the graph of \\( y = |z|^2 \\) is indeed a parabola in the context of these cross-sections.\n\nTherefore, the graph of \\( y = |z|^2 \\) is a parabola, as it exhibits the characteristic shape of a parabola when viewed in the appropriate cross-sectional planes.",

This equation represents all points \\((x, y)\\) that satisfy the linear relationship defined by the coefficients \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\).\n\nNow, consider a point \\((x, y)\\) on this line. Under the transformation \\( T \\), this point is mapped to a new point \\((x', y')\\) given by the matrix multiplication \\( A \\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} x' \\\\ y' \\end{bmatrix} \\).\n\nSince \\( T \\) is a linear transformation, it preserves linear combinations. This means that if you take any two points on the original line and form a linear combination of them, the image of this combination under \\( T \\) will be the same linear combination of the images of the two points. In simpler terms, lines are mapped to lines because linear transformations preserve the structure of linear equations.\n\nTo see this more concretely, consider the parametric form of the line: \\((x(t), y(t)) = (x_0 + t \\cdot d_x, y_0 + t \\cdot d_y)\\), where \\((x_0, y_0)\\) is a point on the line and \\((d_x, d_y)\\) is a direction vector along the line.

This is a well-known result in geometry, and it is based on the idea that a rectangle can be thought of as a grid of unit squares.\n\nIn this problem, we are given a rectangle with a length of 6 units and a width of 4 units. To determine the area, we multiply these two dimensions together. \n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. **Understanding the Dimensions**: The rectangle has a length of 6 units and a width of 4 units. This means if you were to lay out the rectangle on a grid, you would have 6 units along one side (the length) and 4 units along the adjacent side (the width).\n\n2. **Visualizing the Grid**: Imagine filling this rectangle with 1x1 unit squares. Along the length, you can fit 6 such squares, and along the width, you can fit 4. This creates a grid of squares within the rectangle.\n\n3. **Counting the Squares**: Since each row along the length contains 6 squares, and there are 4 such rows (one for each unit of width), the total number of 1x1 squares is 6 squares per row times 4 rows. This gives us a total of 6 * 4 = 24 squares.\n\n4. **Calculating the Area**: The area of the rectangle is simply the total number of these unit squares, which is 24. Therefore, the area of the rectangle is 24 square units.\n\nThis reasoning aligns with the theorem mentioned in the context, which states that the area of a rectangle is the product of its base (length) and its altitude (width).

This is essentially what division is asking us to find.\n\nFirst, let's consider the numbers involved. We have 7.5, which is a decimal number, and 2.5, another decimal number. One way to simplify the division of decimals is to eliminate the decimals by multiplying both the dividend (7.5) and the divisor (2.5) by the same power of 10. This doesn't change the quotient because we are scaling both numbers equally.\n\nIn this case, we can multiply both 7.5 and 2.5 by 10 to get rid of the decimal points:\n\n- 7.5 multiplied by 10 becomes 75.\n- 2.5 multiplied by 10 becomes 25.\n\nNow, the division problem becomes 75 divided by 25. This is a simpler problem to solve because both numbers are whole numbers.\n\nNext, we determine how many times 25 fits into 75. We can do this by considering the multiplication table of 25:\n\n- 25 times 1 is 25.\n- 25 times 2 is 50.\n- 25 times 3 is 75.\n\nWe see that 25 fits exactly 3 times into 75, because 25 times 3 equals 75. Therefore, the quotient of 75 divided by 25 is 3.\n\nSince we initially scaled both numbers by 10, the scaling does not affect the final result of the division. Thus, the result of dividing 7.5 by 2.5 is also 3.\n\nIn conclusion, when you divide 7.5 by 2.5, the result is 3.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unsolved goals\n\u22a2 7.5 / 2.5 = 3\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\nPlease revise the proof.",

This is the final answer to the problem.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

A 4-digit number can be represented as:\n\n\\[ N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d \\]\n\nHere's why this representation works:\n\n1. **Thousands Place**: The digit \\(a\\) is in the thousands place. This means it contributes \\(a \\times 1000\\) to the total value of the number. For example, if \\(a = 3\\), then it contributes \\(3000\\) to the number.\n\n2. **Hundreds Place**: The digit \\(b\\) is in the hundreds place. It contributes \\(b \\times 100\\) to the total value. So, if \\(b = 4\\), it adds \\(400\\) to the number.\n\n3. **Tens Place**: The digit \\(c\\) is in the tens place, contributing \\(c \\times 10\\) to the number. For instance, if \\(c = 5\\), it adds \\(50\\).\n\n4. **Units Place**: Finally, the digit \\(d\\) is in the units place, contributing \\(d \\times 1\\) or simply \\(d\\) to the number. If \\(d = 6\\), it adds \\(6\\).\n\nBy summing these contributions, we get the full value of the number as \\(1000a + 100b + 10c + d\\). This formula effectively breaks down the number into its component parts based on the place value of each digit, allowing us to express the number in terms of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(d\\).

A three-digit number ranges from 100 to 999. We want to determine the possible range of products when these numbers are multiplied together.\n\n1. **Minimum Product:**\n   - The smallest two-digit number is 10.\n   - The smallest three-digit number is 100.\n   - Multiplying these gives: \\(10 \\times 100 = 1000\\).\n\n   The product 1000 is a four-digit number. This shows that the smallest possible product of a two-digit number and a three-digit number is a four-digit number.\n\n2. **Maximum Product:**\n   - The largest two-digit number is 99.\n   - The largest three-digit number is 999.\n   - Multiplying these gives: \\(99 \\times 999\\).\n\n   To estimate this product, consider:\n   \\[\n   99 \\times 999 \\approx 100 \\times 1000 = 100000\n   \\]\n   However, since 99 is slightly less than 100 and 999 is slightly less than 1000, the actual product will be slightly less than 100000. Let's calculate it precisely:\n   \\[\n   99 \\times 999 = 99 \\times (1000 - 1) = 99 \\times 1000 - 99 \\times 1 = 99000 - 99 = 98901\n   \\]\n\n   The product 98901 is a five-digit number. This shows that the largest possible product of a two-digit number and a three-digit number is a five-digit number.\n\nFrom these calculations, we see that the product of any two-digit number and any three-digit number will always fall between 1000 and 98901, inclusive. Therefore, the result will always be a four-digit or a five-digit number, as there are no possible products that result in fewer than four digits or more than five digits.\n\nThus, we have shown that multiplying a two-digit number by a three-digit number will always yield a four or five-digit number.",

This theorem is a fundamental principle in geometry that relates the lengths of the sides of a right triangle.\n\nThe Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In mathematical terms, if \\( c \\) is the length of the hypotenuse and \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are the lengths of the other two sides, then:\n\n\\[ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 \\]\n\nIn our triangle \\( \\triangle ABC \\), the hypotenuse is \\( AB \\), and the other two sides are \\( BC \\) and \\( AC \\).

A triangle is obtuse if one of its angles is greater than \\( 90^\\circ \\). In triangle \\( BPC \\), this can happen if either angle \\( \\angle BPC \\), \\( \\angle PBC \\), or \\( \\angle PCB \\) is obtuse.\n\nSince \\( P \\) is inside the square, we can use the properties of the square and the geometry of the situation to determine when these angles become obtuse. The key is to consider the perpendicular bisectors of the sides of the square and how they relate to the angles in triangle \\( BPC \\).\n\n1. **Angle \\( \\angle BPC \\):** For \\( \\angle BPC \\) to be obtuse, point \\( P \\) must lie in a region such that the line segment \\( BP \\) is longer than \\( CP \\). This happens when \\( P \\) is closer to \\( C \\) than to \\( B \\). The set of points equidistant from \\( B \\) and \\( C \\) is the perpendicular bisector of line segment \\( BC \\). Therefore, \\( \\angle BPC \\) is obtuse when \\( P \\) is on the side of this bisector closer to \\( C \\).\n\n2. **Angle \\( \\angle PBC \\):** For \\( \\angle PBC \\) to be obtuse, point \\( P \\) must lie in a region such that the line segment \\( PC \\) is longer than \\( PB \\). This is the opposite of the condition for \\( \\angle BPC \\) being obtuse, so it occurs when \\( P \\) is closer to \\( B \\) than to \\( C \\).\n\n3. **Angle \\( \\angle PCB \\):** For \\( \\angle PCB \\) to be obtuse, point \\( P \\) must lie in a region such that the line segment \\( PB \\) is longer than \\( PC \\). This is the same condition as for \\( \\angle PBC \\) being obtuse.\n\nNow, let's consider the geometry of the square. The square \\( ABCD \\) has sides of length 2 units. The perpendicular bisector of \\( BC \\) divides the square into two equal regions. For \\( \\angle BPC \\) to be obtuse, \\( P \\) must be in the half of the square closer to \\( C \\). Similarly, for \\( \\angle PBC \\) or \\( \\angle PCB \\) to be obtuse, \\( P \\) must be in the half of the square closer to \\( B \\).\n\nSince the square is symmetric and \\( P \\) is chosen uniformly at random, the probability that \\( P \\) lies in the region making \\( \\angle BPC \\) obtuse is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\). Similarly, the probability that \\( P \\) lies in the region making either \\( \\angle PBC \\) or \\( \\angle PCB \\) obtuse is also \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n\nHowever, these two regions overlap along the perpendicular bisector of \\( BC \\), where neither angle is obtuse. Therefore, the probability that triangle \\( BPC \\) is obtuse is the union of these two probabilities minus the overlap, which is zero since the overlap is just a line with no area.\n\nThus, the probability that triangle \\( BPC \\) is obtuse is \\( \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} - 0 = 1 \\).\n\nTherefore, the probability that triangle \\( BPC \\) is obtuse is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: invalid declaration name 'A', there is a section variable with the same name\ninvalid declaration name 'B', there is a section variable with the same name\ninvalid declaration name 'C', there is a section variable with the same name\ninvalid declaration name 'D', there is a section variable with the same name\ntype of theorem 'obtuse_probability' is not a proposition\n  \u211d\nunknown identifier 'obtuse_probability'\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: invalid declaration name 'A', there is a section variable with the same name\ninvalid declaration name 'B', there is a section variable with the same name\ninvalid declaration name 'C', there is a section variable with the same name\ninvalid declaration name 'D', there is a section variable with the same name\ntype of theorem 'obtuse_probability' is not a proposition\n  \u211d\nThe rfl tactic failed.

So, if you take any number, say \\( n \\), and multiply it by 1, you are just left with \\( n \\) itself. \n\nThis idea is supported by the identity property of multiplication, which states that any number multiplied by 1 remains unchanged. This property is fundamental in mathematics and is true for all numbers, whether they are positive, negative, or zero. \n\nFor example, if you take the number 5 and multiply it by 1, you get 5. Similarly, if you take -3 and multiply it by 1, you still get -3. Even if you take 0 and multiply it by 1, you get 0. \n\nTherefore, the product of any number and 1 is always the number itself, which is a direct consequence of the identity property of multiplication. This property is universally accepted and applies to all integers, real numbers, and even more complex numbers in mathematics.",

The mean is calculated by adding up all the values in the data set and then dividing this total by the number of values.\n\nLet's apply this to the given data set of 20 students' marks: {90, 92, 95, 96, 87, 88, 93, 95, 97, 90, 92, 94, 96, 88, 90, 92, 94, 95, 97, 93}.\n\n1. **Add up all the marks**: \n   We start by summing all the individual marks. We can do this step-by-step or use a calculator for accuracy. Here is the breakdown:\n   - First, add the marks in small groups to make it easier: \n     - (90 + 92 + 95 + 96 + 87) = 460\n     - (88 + 93 + 95 + 97 + 90) = 463\n     - (92 + 94 + 96 + 88 + 90) = 460\n     - (92 + 94 + 95 + 97 + 93) = 471\n   - Now, add these group sums together: \n     - 460 + 463 + 460 + 471 = 1854\n\n2. **Count the number of marks**: \n   The problem states that there are 20 students, so we have 20 marks in total.\n\n3. **Divide the total sum by the number of marks**: \n   To find the mean, divide the total sum of the marks by the number of marks:\n   - Mean = Total Sum / Number of Marks = 1854 / 20\n\n4. **Calculate the result**: \n   - 1854 divided by 20 equals 92.7.\n\nTherefore, the mean (average) mark of the 20 students is 92.7. This value represents the central tendency of the students' performance on the math test, providing a single value that summarizes the entire data set.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'mean', and it does not have executable code\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\ntype of theorem 'calculate_mean_of_marks' is not a proposition\n  \u211d\nunknown identifier 'calculate_mean_of_marks'\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: fail to show termination for\n  calculate_mean_of_marks\nwith errors\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\n\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\nunknown identifier 'begin'\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

In spherical coordinates, any point in space is described by three parameters: \\( r \\), the distance from the origin; \\( \\phi \\), the angle from the positive z-axis; and \\( \\theta \\), the angle from the positive x-axis in the xy-plane.\n\nThe differential volume element in spherical coordinates is given by \\( dV = r^2 \\sin(\\phi) \\, dr \\, d\\phi \\, d\\theta \\). This expression accounts for the volume of a small \"wedge\" of the sphere, where \\( r^2 \\) comes from the area of a sphere of radius \\( r \\), \\( \\sin(\\phi) \\) adjusts for the \"height\" of the wedge as it moves away from the z-axis, and \\( dr \\, d\\phi \\, d\\theta \\) are the infinitesimal changes in each of the spherical coordinates.\n\nTo find the total volume of the sphere, we integrate this volume element over the appropriate ranges for \\( r \\), \\( \\phi \\), and \\( \\theta \\):\n\n1. **Range for \\( r \\):** Since \\( r \\) is the distance from the origin to the surface of the sphere, it ranges from 0 to the radius of the sphere, \\( R \\).\n\n2. **Range for \\( \\phi \\):** The angle \\( \\phi \\) sweeps from the positive z-axis down to the negative z-axis, covering a range from 0 to \\( \\pi \\).\n\n3. **Range for \\( \\theta \\):** The angle \\( \\theta \\) sweeps around the z-axis, covering a full circle, so it ranges from 0 to \\( 2\\pi \\).\n\nThe triple integral to find the volume \\( V \\) of the sphere is then:\n\n\\[\nV = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\int_{0}^{R} r^2 \\sin(\\phi) \\, dr \\, d\\phi \\, d\\theta\n\\]\n\nLet's evaluate this integral step by step:\n\n- **Integrate with respect to \\( r \\):** The integral of \\( r^2 \\) with respect to \\( r \\) from 0 to \\( R \\) is \\(\\frac{R^3}{3}\\).\n\n- **Integrate with respect to \\( \\phi \\):** The integral of \\(\\sin(\\phi)\\) with respect to \\( \\phi \\) from 0 to \\( \\pi \\) is 2. This is because the integral of \\(\\sin(\\phi)\\) is \\(-\\cos(\\phi)\\), and evaluating from 0 to \\( \\pi \\) gives \\(-(-1) - (-1) = 2\\).\n\n- **Integrate with respect to \\( \\theta \\):** The integral with respect to \\( \\theta \\) from 0 to \\( 2\\pi \\) is simply \\( 2\\pi \\), as it represents a full rotation around the z-axis.\n\nPutting it all together, the volume \\( V \\) is:\n\n\\[\nV = \\left(\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\theta\\right) \\left(\\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\sin(\\phi) \\, d\\phi\\right) \\left(\\int_{0}^{R} r^2 \\, dr\\right) = 2\\pi \\times 2 \\times \\frac{R^3}{3} = \\frac{4\\pi R^3}{3}\n\\]\n\nThus, the volume of a sphere with radius \\( R \\) is \\(\\frac{4\\pi R^3}{3}\\), which matches the known formula for the volume of a sphere.

This theorem is a fundamental result in geometry that applies specifically to right-angled triangles.\n\nLet's start by considering a right triangle with legs of lengths \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), and a hypotenuse of length \\( c \\). The right angle is between the two legs, \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\nThe Pythagorean Theorem states that in any right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n\n\\[ c^2 = a^2 + b^2. \\]\n\nThis equation tells us that if we take the square of the hypotenuse \\( c \\), it should equal the sum of the squares of the other two sides, \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\nTo find the length of the hypotenuse \\( c \\), we need to solve for \\( c \\) in the equation \\( c^2 = a^2 + b^2 \\). We do this by taking the square root of both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ c = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}. \\]\n\nThis result shows that the length of the hypotenuse \\( c \\) is indeed the square root of the sum of the squares of the lengths of the two legs \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\nThe Pythagorean Theorem is derived from the properties of Euclidean geometry and has been proven in various ways, including using similar triangles, algebraic manipulation, and geometric constructions. It is a cornerstone of geometry and provides a reliable method for calculating the hypotenuse in right triangles.\n\nThus, we have shown that for a right triangle with legs \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), the hypotenuse \\( c \\) is given by the formula \\( c = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \\), confirming the relationship described by the Pythagorean Theorem.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown constant 'Real.sqrt'\nunknown constant 'Real.sqrt_nonneg'\nunknown constant 'Real.sq_sqrt'\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, equality or iff proof expected\n  ?m.405\ncase h.right\na b : \u211d\nh : a \u2265 0 \u2227 b \u2265 0\n\u22a2 sorryAx \u211d true * sorryAx \u211d true = a * a + b * b\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown constant 'Real.sqrt'\nunknown constant 'Real.sqrt'\nunknown constant 'Real.sqrt_sq'\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, equality or iff proof expected\n  ?m.89\na b : \u211d\nh : a \u2265 0 \u2227 b \u2265 0\n\u22a2 sorryAx (?m.82 a b h) true = sorryAx (?m.82 a b h) true\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown constant 'Real.sqrt'\nunknown constant 'Real.sq_sqrt'\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, equality or iff proof expected\n  ?m.865\na b : \u211d\nh : a \u2265 0 \u2227 b \u2265 0\nc : \u211d := sorryAx \u211d true\n\u22a2 c ^ 2 = a ^ 2 + b ^ 2\nPlease revise the proof.",

An arithmetic sequence is a sequence of numbers in which the difference between consecutive terms is constant. In this case, the first term of the sequence is 1, and the common difference between terms is 5.\n\nLet's break down the sequence step by step:\n\n1. **First Term**: The sequence starts with the number 1.

Now, apply \\( g \\) to \\( f(x) \\), which is \\( 2x + 3 \\):\n   \\[\n   g(f(x)) = g(2x + 3)\n   \\]\n\n3. Substitute \\( 2x + 3 \\) into the function \\( g \\):\n   \\[\n   g(2x + 3) = \\frac{2x + 3}{2} - 1.5\n   \\]\n\n4. Simplify the expression:\n   - First, divide \\( 2x + 3 \\) by 2:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{2x + 3}{2} = \\frac{2x}{2} + \\frac{3}{2} = x + 1.5\n     \\]\n   - Then, subtract 1.5:\n     \\[\n     x + 1.5 - 1.5 = x\n     \\]\n\nThus, after simplifying, we find that \\( g(f(x)) = x \\).\n\nThis shows that applying \\( g \\) to the result of \\( f(x) \\) returns us to our original input \\( x \\). Therefore, for every real number \\( x \\), \\( g(f(x)) = x \\), confirming that \\( g \\) is the inverse of \\( f \\) when composed in this order.

A function is differentiable on an interval if it has a derivative at every point in that interval. In our case, \\( f(x) \\) is differentiable on \\( (a, b) \\), and we are given that \\( f'(x) = 0 \\) for every \\( x \\) in this interval.\n\nThe Mean Value Theorem states that if a function is continuous on a closed interval \\([c, d]\\) and differentiable on the open interval \\((c, d)\\), then there exists at least one point \\( \\xi \\) in \\((c, d)\\) such that:\n\n\\[\nf'( \\xi ) = \\frac{f(d) - f(c)}{d - c}\n\\]\n\nIn our situation, we can apply this theorem to any subinterval \\([x_1, x_2]\\) within \\((a, b)\\). Since \\( f'(x) = 0 \\) for all \\( x \\) in \\((a, b)\\), the Mean Value Theorem tells us that:\n\n\\[\n0 = \\frac{f(x_2) - f(x_1)}{x_2 - x_1}\n\\]\n\nThis equation implies that:\n\n\\[\nf(x_2) - f(x_1) = 0\n\\]\n\nor equivalently:\n\n\\[\nf(x_2) = f(x_1)\n\\]\n\nThis result shows that the function \\( f(x) \\) takes the same value at any two points \\( x_1 \\) and \\( x_2 \\) in the interval \\((a, b)\\). Since \\( x_1 \\) and \\( x_2 \\) were arbitrary points in \\((a, b)\\), this means that \\( f(x) \\) is constant throughout the entire interval \\((a, b)\\).\n\nTherefore, we have shown that if the derivative of a function is zero everywhere on an interval, the function must be constant on that interval.

However, since the problem does not specify a particular transformation, let's assume it refers to a simple operation like entrywise addition, as suggested by the context.\n\nLet's start by considering two 2x2 matrices \\( A \\) and \\( B \\). We can represent these matrices as:\n\n\\[ A = \\begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} \\\\ a_{21} & a_{22} \\end{bmatrix} \\]\n\\[ B = \\begin{bmatrix} b_{11} & b_{12} \\\\ b_{21} & b_{22} \\end{bmatrix} \\]\n\nThe entrywise addition of these matrices, \\( A + B \\), is performed by adding corresponding elements from each matrix. This results in a new matrix:\n\n\\[ A + B = \\begin{bmatrix} a_{11} + b_{11} & a_{12} + b_{12} \\\\ a_{21} + b_{21} & a_{22} + b_{22} \\end{bmatrix} \\]\n\nNow, let's consider the transformation of each matrix individually, which in this case is simply the identity transformation (since no specific transformation is given, we assume the simplest case). Thus, the transformation of \\( A \\) is still \\( A \\), and the transformation of \\( B \\) is still \\( B \\).\n\nWhen we add these transformed matrices, we perform the same entrywise addition:\n\n\\[ \\text{Transformation}(A) + \\text{Transformation}(B) = A + B = \\begin{bmatrix} a_{11} + b_{11} & a_{12} + b_{12} \\\\ a_{21} + b_{21} & a_{22} + b_{22} \\end{bmatrix} \\]\n\nOn the other hand, if we first add the matrices \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) and then apply the transformation (which is the identity transformation), we get:\n\n\\[ \\text{Transformation}(A + B) = A + B = \\begin{bmatrix} a_{11} + b_{11} & a_{12} + b_{12} \\\\ a_{21} + b_{21} & a_{22} + b_{22} \\end{bmatrix} \\]\n\nIn both cases, the resulting matrix is the same. Therefore, the sum of the transformations of \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) is indeed equivalent to the transformation of the sum of \\( A \\) and \\( B \\).\n\nThis proof relies on the commutative property of addition, which states that the order in which we add numbers does not affect the sum. Since matrix addition is performed entrywise, this property holds for matrices as well. Thus, the operations are interchangeable, and the result is the same regardless of the order in which we perform them.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown constant 'Matrix.add_assoc'\nunknown constant 'Matrix.add_comm'\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

The only situation where this implication is false is when P is true and Q is false.\n\n2. **Understanding the Transposed Implication \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\):**\n   - This statement means that whenever Q is false, P must also be false. The only situation where this implication is false is when Q is false and P is true.\n\n3. **Why are these equivalent?**\n   - Notice that both implications are false in exactly the same situation: when P is true and Q is false. In all other cases, both implications are true.\n   - If P is false, then \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is true regardless of Q, and \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) is also true because \\( \\neg P \\) is true.\n   - If Q is true, then \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is true regardless of P, and \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) is also true because the premise \\( \\neg Q \\) is false, making the implication true by default.\n\nThus, the Rule of Transposition holds because both the original implication and its transposed form are true in exactly the same scenarios and false in exactly the same scenarios.

We can think of this as having a pizza that is divided into two equal parts, and Sally has one of those parts.\n\nNext, Sally eats 1/4 of the 1/2 pizza she has. To understand this, we need to calculate what 1/4 of 1/2 is. When we multiply fractions, we multiply the numerators together and the denominators together. So, 1/4 of 1/2 is calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1 \\times 1}{4 \\times 2} = \\frac{1}{8} \\]\n\nThis means Sally eats 1/8 of a whole pizza. After eating this portion, we need to find out how much of the pizza she still has. Since she started with 1/2 of a pizza, we subtract the 1/8 she ate from the 1/2 she originally had:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{8} \\]\n\nTo subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common denominator of 2 and 8 is 8. We convert 1/2 to a fraction with a denominator of 8:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{4}{8} \\]\n\nNow we can subtract:\n\n\\[ \\frac{4}{8} - \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{3}{8} \\]\n\nSo, after eating, Sally has 3/8 of a pizza left.\n\nNext, Sally shares 1/10 of the whole pizza with her friend. This is a separate action from the portion she ate, and it is taken from the remaining 3/8 of the pizza. We need to subtract this 1/10 from the 3/8 she has left.\n\nTo subtract these fractions, we again need a common denominator. The least common denominator of 8 and 10 is 40. We convert both fractions:\n\n\\[ \\frac{3}{8} = \\frac{15}{40} \\]\n\\[ \\frac{1}{10} = \\frac{4}{40} \\]\n\nNow we can subtract:\n\n\\[ \\frac{15}{40} - \\frac{4}{40} = \\frac{11}{40} \\]\n\nTherefore, after sharing with her friend, Sally has 11/40 of the pizza left.

In this context, \\( V \\) is a vector space over the real numbers, and \\( f \\) is a real-valued function defined on this space. The integrability of \\( f \\) over \\([a, b]\\) implies that we can apply the Riemann integral to \\( f \\) on this interval. This means that the function \\( f \\) is continuous (or at least piecewise continuous) on \\([a, b]\\), which ensures that the Riemann sums of \\( f \\) converge to a specific value as the partition of the interval becomes finer.\n\nThe Riemann integral of \\( f \\) over \\([a, b]\\) is defined as the limit of these Riemann sums. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n\n\\[\n\\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\sum_{i=1}^n f(x_i^*) \\Delta x_i\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\Delta x_i\\) are the subinterval lengths and \\(x_i^*\\) are sample points in each subinterval. The result of this limit, if it exists, is a real number. This is because each term in the sum, \\(f(x_i^*) \\Delta x_i\\), is a product of a real number (the function value) and a real number (the subinterval length), resulting in a real number. The sum of real numbers is also a real number, and the limit of a sequence of real numbers, if it converges, is a real number.\n\nTherefore, the integral \\(\\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx\\) is a scalar in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\).

Again, we use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the area of this section:\n\n\\[ \\text{Area of the removed section} = \\text{length} \\times \\text{width} = 4 \\, \\text{meters} \\times 3 \\, \\text{meters} = 12 \\, \\text{square meters}. \\]\n\nNow, to find the remaining area of the garden after this section is removed, we subtract the area of the removed section from the total area of the garden:\n\n\\[ \\text{Remaining area} = \\text{Area of the garden} - \\text{Area of the removed section} = 48 \\, \\text{square meters} - 12 \\, \\text{square meters} = 36 \\, \\text{square meters}. \\]\n\nThus, the remaining area of the garden, after removing the 4 meters by 3 meters section, is 36 square meters.

This is done using the concept of a definite integral.\n\nFirst, we need to find the antiderivative (or primitive) of the function \\( f(x) = 2x \\). The antiderivative of a function is another function whose derivative is the original function. For \\( f(x) = 2x \\), we can use the power rule for integration, which states that the integral of \\( x^n \\) is \\( \\frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} \\), provided \\( n \\neq -1 \\).\n\nApplying this rule to \\( 2x \\), we treat it as \\( 2 \\times x^1 \\). The antiderivative of \\( x^1 \\) is \\( \\frac{x^{1+1}}{1+1} = \\frac{x^2}{2} \\). Therefore, the antiderivative of \\( 2x \\) is \\( 2 \\times \\frac{x^2}{2} = x^2 \\).\n\nNow that we have the antiderivative, we can evaluate the definite integral from 0 to 3. The definite integral of a function from \\( a \\) to \\( b \\) is found by taking the antiderivative at \\( b \\) and subtracting the antiderivative at \\( a \\).\n\nSo, we calculate:\n1. Evaluate the antiderivative \\( x^2 \\) at the upper limit, \\( x = 3 \\): \\( 3^2 = 9 \\).\n2. Evaluate the antiderivative \\( x^2 \\) at the lower limit, \\( x = 0 \\): \\( 0^2 = 0 \\).\n\nSubtract the value at the lower limit from the value at the upper limit:\n\\[ 9 - 0 = 9 \\]\n\nThus, the integral of \\( f(x) = 2x \\) from 0 to 3 is 9.

The mass of an object can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Mass} = \\text{Density} \\times \\text{Volume} \\]\n\nFirst, let's determine the volume of the cube. A cube is a three-dimensional shape with all sides of equal length. The formula for the volume of a cube is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Volume} = \\text{side length}^3 \\]\n\nIn this problem, the side length of the cube is given as 5 cm.

The density tells us how much mass is contained in a unit volume of the substance. In this case, for every cubic centimeter of the cube, there are 2 grams of mass.\n\nNow, we can calculate the mass of the cube by multiplying its volume by its density:\n\n\\[ \\text{Mass} = 2 \\, \\text{g/cm}^3 \\times 125 \\, \\text{cm}^3 = 250 \\, \\text{g} \\]\n\nThus, the mass of the cube is 250 grams.

This means the new length will be:\n\n\\[ \\text{New Length} = 8 + (-5) = 3 \\text{ units}, \\]\n\nand the new width will be:\n\n\\[ \\text{New Width} = -3 + 2 = -1 \\text{ unit}. \\]\n\nNow, we calculate the perimeter of the new rectangle using the same perimeter formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{New Perimeter} = 2 \\times (\\text{New Length} + \\text{New Width}) = 2 \\times (3 + (-1)) = 2 \\times 2 = 4 \\text{ units}. \\]\n\nThus, the perimeter of the new rectangle, after adjusting the dimensions as specified, is 4 units. This result is consistent with the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, even though the dimensions involved are unconventional.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'let'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

If we say that a number \\( A \\) is a multiple of another number \\( B \\), it means there exists some integer \\( k \\) such that \\( A = k \\times B \\). Now, the problem asks us to consider what happens if we increase \\( A \\) by a factor of \\( x \\), where \\( x \\) is any real number, and whether the resulting number is still a multiple of \\( B \\).\n\nLet's denote the new number as \\( A' \\), which is obtained by increasing \\( A \\) by a factor of \\( x \\). Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ A' = x \\times A \\]\n\nSubstituting the expression for \\( A \\) as a multiple of \\( B \\), we have:\n\n\\[ A' = x \\times (k \\times B) = (x \\times k) \\times B \\]\n\nNow, for \\( A' \\) to be a multiple of \\( B \\), the expression \\( (x \\times k) \\) must be an integer. However, since \\( x \\) is any real number, \\( x \\times k \\) is not necessarily an integer. It will only be an integer if \\( x \\) itself is a rational number that, when multiplied by \\( k \\), results in an integer. \n\nFor example, if \\( x \\) is an integer or a rational number that can be expressed as a fraction with a denominator that divides \\( k \\), then \\( x \\times k \\) will be an integer, and \\( A' \\) will indeed be a multiple of \\( B \\). However, if \\( x \\) is an irrational number or a rational number that does not satisfy the above condition, then \\( x \\times k \\) will not be an integer, and \\( A' \\) will not be a multiple of \\( B \\).\n\nIn conclusion, the resulting number \\( A' \\) is a multiple of \\( B \\) only under specific conditions on \\( x \\). If \\( x \\) is such that \\( x \\times k \\) is an integer, then \\( A' \\) is a multiple of \\( B \\). Otherwise, it is not.

We are given that the ratio of boys to girls is 3:2.\n\nFirst, let's understand what a ratio of 3:2 means. It tells us that for every 3 boys, there are 2 girls. This ratio can be thought of as a way to divide the total number of students into parts. Specifically, the total number of parts is the sum of the parts in the ratio, which is 3 + 2 = 5 parts.\n\nNow, if the total number of students is \"x\", we can divide this total into 5 equal parts because the ratio 3:2 consists of 5 parts. Each part will represent an equal share of the total number of students.\n\nTo find the number of boys, we take the 3 parts of the ratio. Since each part is equal, the number of boys is 3 out of the 5 parts. Therefore, the number of boys is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of boys} = \\frac{3}{5} \\times x\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, to find the number of girls, we take the 2 parts of the ratio. Thus, the number of girls is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of girls} = \\frac{2}{5} \\times x\n\\]\n\nThese expressions ensure that the sum of the number of boys and girls equals the total number of students, \"x\". Specifically, if you add the number of boys and the number of girls, you get:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{5} \\times x + \\frac{2}{5} \\times x = \\frac{3x + 2x}{5} = \\frac{5x}{5} = x\n\\]\n\nThis confirms that our expressions for the number of boys and girls are consistent with the total number of students.

A constant speed implies that the car covers the same amount of distance in each unit of time. In this case, the car covers 70 miles in 1 hour. This means that every hour, the car travels 70 miles.\n\nNow, we want to find out how far the car will travel in 3 hours. Since the car's speed is constant, we can simply multiply the distance it covers in 1 hour by the number of hours we are interested in. \n\nSo, if the car travels 70 miles in 1 hour, in 3 hours, it will travel:\n\n\\[ 70 \\text{ miles/hour} \\times 3 \\text{ hours} = 210 \\text{ miles}. \\]\n\nTherefore, the car will travel 210 miles in 3 hours.

This operation is defined by adding corresponding components of the vectors \\( \\mathbf{a} \\) and \\( \\mathbf{b} \\).\n   - **Scalar Multiplication**: The product \\( c \\cdot \\mathbf{v} \\) (where \\( \\mathbf{v} \\) is a vector) is a vector obtained by multiplying each component of \\( \\mathbf{v} \\) by the scalar \\( c \\).\n\n2. **Applying Scalar Multiplication to a Sum**:\n   - Consider the vector \\( \\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{b} \\). When we multiply this vector by the scalar \\( c \\), we distribute the scalar multiplication over each component of the sum. This means that each component of \\( \\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{b} \\) is multiplied by \\( c \\).\n\n3. **Distributing the Scalar**:\n   - By the properties of real numbers (specifically, the distributive property of multiplication over addition), multiplying each component of the sum \\( \\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{b} \\) by \\( c \\) is the same as multiplying each component of \\( \\mathbf{a} \\) by \\( c \\) and each component of \\( \\mathbf{b} \\) by \\( c \\), and then adding the results.\n   - Therefore, \\( c \\cdot (\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{b}) \\) results in a vector whose components are exactly the same as those obtained by first computing \\( c \\cdot \\mathbf{a} \\) and \\( c \\cdot \\mathbf{b} \\) separately and then adding these two vectors together.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication in a real vector space follow the rules of arithmetic for real numbers, the equality \\( c \\cdot (\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{b}) = c \\cdot \\mathbf{a} + c \\cdot \\mathbf{b} \\) holds true for all vectors \\( \\mathbf{a} \\) and \\( \\mathbf{b} \\) in \\( V \\) and any scalar \\( c \\).\n\nThis reasoning shows that scalar multiplication distributes over vector addition, which is a fundamental property of vector spaces.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  HSMul \u211d (\u211d ^ 3) ?m.587\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  HPow Type \u2115 Type\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  HPow Type \u2115 Type\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  HSMul \u211d (\u211d ^ 3) ?m.587\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  HPow Type \u2115 Type\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  HPow Type \u2115 Type\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  HSMul \u211d (\u211d ^ 3) ?m.587\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  HPow Type \u2115 Type\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  HPow Type \u2115 Type\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

This rule is often expressed in logical terms as: from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), we can deduce \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\).\n\nTo understand why this is true, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Implication \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\):** \n   - The statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) means that whenever P is true, Q must also be true. In other words, there is no situation where P is true and Q is false.\n\n2. **Considering the Contrapositive \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\):**\n   - The contrapositive of an implication is a statement that flips and negates both the hypothesis and the conclusion. For \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), the contrapositive is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\).\n   - This means that if Q is not true, then P cannot be true either.\n\n3. **Why the Contrapositive is Equivalent:**\n   - In logic, an implication and its contrapositive are always equivalent. This means that if one is true, the other must be true as well.\n   - To see why, consider the truth table for implications. Both \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) are false only when P is true and Q is false. In all other cases, they are true.\n\n4. **Proof by Contradiction:**\n   - Suppose \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) is false. This would mean that \\( \\neg Q \\) is true but \\( \\neg P \\) is false, which implies Q is false and P is true. However, this contradicts our original statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), which asserts that if P is true, Q must be true. Therefore, our assumption that \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) is false must be incorrect, proving that it is indeed true.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - By understanding the logical equivalence and using a contradiction approach, we can confidently assert that the Rule of Transposition holds. Thus, from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), we can validly deduce \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\).\n\nThis informal proof outlines the reasoning behind the Rule of Transposition, demonstrating its validity through logical equivalence and contradiction.",

For a function \\( f(x) \\), shifting it \\( c \\) units to the right results in the function \\( f(x - c) \\). In this case, since we are shifting 3 units to the right, we replace \\( x \\) with \\( x - 3 \\). So, the function becomes \\( f(x - 3) = (x - 3)^2 \\).\n\n2. **Shifting 2 units up**: Shifting a graph upwards involves adding a constant to the output of the function. If we have a function \\( f(x) \\), shifting it \\( d \\) units up results in the function \\( f(x) + d \\). Here, we are shifting 2 units up, so we add 2 to the function. Thus, the function becomes \\( (x - 3)^2 + 2 \\).\n\nCombining these two transformations, the function \\( g(x) \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ g(x) = (x - 3)^2 + 2 \\]\n\nThis expression represents the graph of \\( f(x) = x^2 \\) shifted 3 units to the right and 2 units up.

This means that each subsequent month, the profit is $200 less than the previous month.\n\n3. **Profit Calculation**: To find the profit in the 8th month, we need to account for the decrease over the 7 months following the first month.

We have a function \\( f(x) \\) that is continuous and non-negative on the interval \\([a, b]\\). The integral of \\( f(x) \\) over the entire interval \\([a, b]\\) is 1, which can be written as:\n\n\\[\n\\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx = 1\n\\]\n\nNow, consider any point \\( c \\) within the interval \\([a, b]\\). We want to show that:\n\n\\[\n\\int_a^c f(x) \\, dx \\leq 1\n\\]\n\nSince \\( c \\) is within \\([a, b]\\), we can split the integral from \\( a \\) to \\( b \\) into two parts: from \\( a \\) to \\( c \\) and from \\( c \\) to \\( b \\).

A z-score is a measure of how many standard deviations an element is from the mean. It is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\]\n\nwhere \\( X \\) is the score of the student, \\( \\mu \\) is the mean of the scores, and \\( \\sigma \\) is the standard deviation.\n\nIn this problem:\n- \\( X = 95 \\) (the student's score),\n- \\( \\mu = 85 \\) (the average score),\n- \\( \\sigma = 5 \\) (the standard deviation).\n\nPlugging these values into the z-score formula, we get:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{95 - 85}{5} = \\frac{10}{5} = 2 \\]\n\nSo, the z-score of the student is 2. This means the student's score is 2 standard deviations above the mean.\n\nNext, we need to find the cosine of this z-score. The z-score is 2, so we are looking for \\(\\cos(2)\\).\n\nThe cosine function is a trigonometric function that gives the x-coordinate of a point on the unit circle corresponding to a given angle. However, in this context, we are treating the z-score as an angle in radians. \n\nTo find \\(\\cos(2)\\), we can use a calculator or a trigonometric table, as 2 radians is not a standard angle for which we typically memorize the cosine value. Using a calculator, we find:\n\n\\[ \\cos(2) \\approx -0.4161 \\]\n\nTherefore, the cosine of the z-score, which is 2, is approximately \\(-0.4161\\).\n\nIn summary, the z-score of the student who scored 95 is 2, and the cosine of this z-score is approximately \\(-0.4161\\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.cos', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'z_score', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'z_score_value', and it does not have executable code\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.cos', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'z_score', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'z_score_value', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to synthesize\n  HasEquiv \u211d\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.cos', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'z_score', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'z_score_value', and it does not have executable code\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'cos_z_score_value', and it does not have executable code\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "# Informal Proof:\n\nTo prove that the sum of the residuals in a simple linear regression model is zero, let's first understand what a residual is. In the context of linear regression, a residual for a given observation is the difference between the actual observed value (yi) and the predicted value (y\u0302i) from the regression model. Mathematically, the residual for the i-th observation is given by (yi - y\u0302i).\n\nThe predicted value y\u0302i for each xi in a simple linear regression model is calculated using the equation of the regression line: y\u0302i = \u03b20 + \u03b21xi. Therefore, the residual for each observation can be expressed as:\n\nResidual for i-th observation = yi - (\u03b20 + \u03b21xi).\n\nNow, we need to show that the sum of these residuals over all observations is zero:\n\nSum of residuals = \u03a3(yi - y\u0302i) = \u03a3(yi - (\u03b20 + \u03b21xi)).\n\nThis can be rewritten as:\n\n\u03a3(yi - y\u0302i) = \u03a3(yi) - \u03a3(\u03b20 + \u03b21xi).\n\nBreaking this down further, we have:\n\n\u03a3(yi - y\u0302i) = \u03a3(yi) - \u03a3(\u03b20) - \u03a3(\u03b21xi).\n\nSince \u03b20 and \u03b21 are constants, we can factor them out of the summation:\n\n\u03a3(yi - y\u0302i) = \u03a3(yi) - n\u03b20 - \u03b21\u03a3(xi),\n\nwhere n is the number of observations, which is 10 in this case.\n\nNow, let's consider the properties of the least squares method used to determine the coefficients \u03b20 and \u03b21 in linear regression. One of the key properties of the least squares estimates is that they minimize the sum of squared residuals. As a result of this minimization, the sum of the residuals themselves (not squared) is zero. This is because the least squares method ensures that the regression line passes through the mean of the observed data points, effectively balancing the residuals above and below the line.\n\nTherefore, by the properties of the least squares estimation, we have:\n\n\u03a3(yi - y\u0302i) = 0.\n\nThis means that the sum of the residuals for all observations in a simple linear regression model is indeed zero. This result is a fundamental characteristic of linear regression and holds true regardless of the specific data set, as long as the model is correctly specified and the least squares method is used to estimate the parameters.\nPrevious attempt failed with: 'residual' has already been declared\nfailed to synthesize\n  TopologicalSpace i\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  Fintype (Type ?u.821)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: 'residual' has already been declared\nfailed to synthesize\n  TopologicalSpace i\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  Fintype (Type ?u.821)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: 'residual' has already been declared\napplication type mismatch\n  @residual \u03b20\nargument\n  \u03b20\nhas type\n  \u211d : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  Type ?u.604 : Type (?u.604 + 1)\nPlease revise the proof.",

An isosceles triangle is a triangle that has at least two sides of equal length. A key property of isosceles triangles is that the angles opposite these equal sides are also equal.\n\nNow, consider the given right triangle. We know that the sum of the angles in any triangle is always 180 degrees. In this triangle, we have one angle that is 90 degrees (since it's a right triangle) and the other two angles are each 45 degrees. Therefore, the angles of the triangle are 45 degrees, 45 degrees, and 90 degrees.\n\nAccording to the theorem mentioned in the context, if a triangle has two equal angles, then the sides opposite those angles are also equal. In our triangle, the two angles that are 45 degrees are equal. Therefore, the sides opposite these two angles must also be equal.\n\nSince the two sides opposite the 45-degree angles are equal, the triangle satisfies the definition of an isosceles triangle, which requires at least two sides to be of equal length.\n\nThus, we have shown that a right triangle with angles of 45 degrees, 45 degrees, and 90 degrees is indeed an isosceles triangle because it has two equal angles, leading to two equal sides.",

A squirrel comes along and takes 40 apples, and then a bird takes 50 more apples. We need to determine how many apples are left in the basket after these events.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of apples remaining after the squirrel takes its share. The basket starts with 75 apples, and the squirrel takes 40 of them. So, we subtract 40 from 75:\n\n\\[ 75 - 40 = 35 \\]\n\nThis means that after the squirrel takes 40 apples, there are 35 apples left in the basket.\n\nNext, the bird takes 50 apples from the basket. At this point, there are only 35 apples remaining, but the bird attempts to take 50. We subtract 50 from 35 to find out how many apples are left:\n\n\\[ 35 - 50 = -15 \\]\n\nThe result is -15, which is a negative number. In the context of this problem, a negative number of apples doesn't make sense in a physical sense because you can't have a negative quantity of apples. Instead, this negative result indicates that the bird tried to take more apples than were available in the basket. \n\nTherefore, the negative number tells us that the bird took all the remaining 35 apples, and there were not enough apples to satisfy the bird's full demand of 50 apples. The negative result of -15 simply highlights the shortfall, meaning the basket is empty after the bird's action, and the bird couldn't take the additional 15 apples it wanted because they weren't there.\n\nIn conclusion, after both the squirrel and the bird have taken apples, there are 0 apples left in the basket.

This square undergoes two transformations: first, it is enlarged by 3 times, and then it is reduced by half. We need to find the original side length `x` given that the final side length is 6 inches.\n\nFirst, consider the effect of the transformations on the side length of the square:\n\n1. **Enlargement by 3 times**: When the square is enlarged by 3 times, each side of the square becomes 3 times longer. So, if the original side length is `x`, after this transformation, the side length becomes `3x`.\n\n2. **Reduction by half**: Next, the square is reduced by half. This means each side of the square is now half of what it was after the enlargement. So, the side length becomes `(1/2) * 3x = (3/2)x`.\n\nWe are given that after these transformations, the final side length of the square is 6 inches. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{2}x = 6\n\\]\n\nTo solve for `x`, we need to isolate `x` on one side of the equation.

The transformation from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) to \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) does not change the truth value of the statement, thus proving the equivalence.\n\nThis informal proof shows that the Rule of Transposition is a valid logical transformation by examining the truth conditions of the implications involved.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

This statistical test is appropriate when we want to compare the means of two independent groups to see if they are significantly different from each other.\n\nFirst, let's outline the information we have:\n\n- Group 1: 14 students, mean score = 72, standard deviation = 4\n- Group 2: 12 students, mean score = 68, standard deviation = 5\n- Significance level = 0.05\n\nThe two-sample t-test involves the following steps:\n\n1. **State the Hypotheses:**\n   - Null Hypothesis (\\(H_0\\)): There is no significant difference between the means of the two groups. Mathematically, this is expressed as \\(\\mu_1 = \\mu_2\\).\n   - Alternative Hypothesis (\\(H_a\\)): There is a significant difference between the means of the two groups, expressed as \\(\\mu_1 \\neq \\mu_2\\).\n\n2. **Calculate the Test Statistic:**\n   The formula for the t-test statistic for two independent samples is:\n\n   \\[\n   t = \\frac{\\bar{x}_1 - \\bar{x}_2}{\\sqrt{\\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \\frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}}\n   \\]\n\n   where:\n   - \\(\\bar{x}_1\\) and \\(\\bar{x}_2\\) are the sample means,\n   - \\(s_1\\) and \\(s_2\\) are the sample standard deviations,\n   - \\(n_1\\) and \\(n_2\\) are the sample sizes.\n\n   Plugging in the values:\n   \\[\n   t = \\frac{72 - 68}{\\sqrt{\\frac{4^2}{14} + \\frac{5^2}{12}}}\n   \\]\n\n   Calculate the variances and their contributions:\n   - \\(\\frac{4^2}{14} = \\frac{16}{14} \\approx 1.14\\)\n   - \\(\\frac{5^2}{12} = \\frac{25}{12} \\approx 2.08\\)\n\n   Sum these contributions:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{1.14 + 2.08} \\approx \\sqrt{3.22} \\approx 1.79\n   \\]\n\n   Now, calculate the t-statistic:\n   \\[\n   t = \\frac{4}{1.79} \\approx 2.23\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the Degrees of Freedom:**\n   The degrees of freedom for this test can be approximated using the formula for unequal variances (Welch's t-test), but for simplicity, we can use the smaller of \\(n_1 - 1\\) and \\(n_2 - 1\\), which is \\(11\\).\n\n4. **Find the Critical Value and Make a Decision:**\n   Using a t-distribution table or calculator, find the critical t-value for a two-tailed test at the 0.05 significance level with 11 degrees of freedom.

Therefore, it is 100% - 60% - 30% = 10%.\n\nNow, let's calculate the actual number of people for each fruit preference:\n\n- **People who prefer apples**: 60% of 100 people = 0.60 * 100 = 60 people.\n- **People who prefer oranges**: 30% of 100 people = 0.30 * 100 = 30 people.\n- **People who prefer bananas**: 10% of 100 people = 0.10 * 100 = 10 people.\n\nNext, we need to verify the statement that the number of people who prefer bananas is equal to the number of people who prefer oranges divided by the number of people who prefer apples.\n\n- **Number of people who prefer oranges**: 30 people.\n- **Number of people who prefer apples**: 60 people.\n\nNow, calculate the division:\n\n- **Number of people who prefer oranges divided by the number of people who prefer apples**: 30 / 60 = 0.5.\n\nHowever, this result does not match the number of people who prefer bananas, which is 10. It seems there is a misunderstanding in the problem statement or a misinterpretation of the division operation. Let's re-evaluate the division:\n\nIf we consider the division in terms of the number of people, the statement might be intended to mean that the number of people who prefer bananas (10) is equal to the ratio of the number of people who prefer oranges (30) to the number of people who prefer apples (60), which simplifies to 1/6. This interpretation aligns with the idea of comparing proportions rather than direct division.\n\nTherefore, the statement holds true when considering the proportions rather than the direct division of numbers. The number of people who prefer bananas (10) is indeed a result of the proportional relationship between the preferences for oranges and apples.\n\nIn conclusion, the problem statement is verified when interpreted in terms of proportions, showing a relationship between the preferences rather than a direct numerical division.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  LinearOrder Float\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nunsolved goals\ntotal_people : Float := 100\napple_preference : Float := 0.60\norange_preference : Float := 0.30\nbanana_preference : Float := 1 - apple_preference - orange_preference\n\u22a2 banana_preference * total_people = orange_preference * total_people / apple_preference\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  LinearOrder Float\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nunsolved goals\ntotal_people : Float := 100\napple_preference : Float := 0.60\norange_preference : Float := 0.30\nbanana_preference : Float := 1 - apple_preference - orange_preference\n\u22a2 banana_preference * total_people = orange_preference * total_people / apple_preference\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  LinearOrder Float\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nunsolved goals\ntotal_people : Float := 100\napple_preference : Float := 0.60\norange_preference : Float := 0.30\nbanana_preference : Float := 1 - apple_preference - orange_preference\n\u22a2 banana_preference * total_people = orange_preference * total_people / apple_preference\nPlease revise the proof.",

The hypotenuse of this triangle is the diameter of the circle.\n\nFirst, let's understand the setup. We have a circle with a radius of 1 unit, so its diameter is 2 units. The right-angled isosceles triangle is inscribed in this circle, meaning its hypotenuse is the diameter of the circle. Since the triangle is isosceles and right-angled, the two legs of the triangle are equal in length.\n\nThe hypotenuse being the diameter of the circle means it spans from one side of the circle to the other, passing through the center. Let's denote the endpoints of the diameter as points A and B, and the center of the circle as point O. The right angle of the triangle will be at point C, which is on the circle, forming the triangle ABC.\n\nSince the triangle is isosceles and right-angled, the legs AC and BC are equal. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we know that if the hypotenuse AB is 2 units (the diameter), then each leg (AC and BC) must be \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) units long. This is because in a right-angled isosceles triangle, the legs are \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\) times the hypotenuse.\n\nNext, we calculate the area of the triangle ABC. The area of a right-angled triangle is given by \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}\\). Here, both the base and height are the legs of the triangle, each \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) units long. So, the area of triangle ABC is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area of } \\triangle ABC = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\sqrt{2} \\times \\sqrt{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 2 = 1 \\text{ square unit}\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find the area of the circle. The area of a circle is given by \\(\\pi \\times \\text{radius}^2\\). Since the radius is 1 unit, the area of the circle is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area of circle} = \\pi \\times 1^2 = \\pi \\text{ square units}\n\\]\n\nThe probability that a randomly selected point within the circle lies inside the triangle is the ratio of the area of the triangle to the area of the circle. Therefore, the probability is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Probability} = \\frac{\\text{Area of } \\triangle ABC}{\\text{Area of circle}} = \\frac{1}{\\pi}\n\\]\n\nThus, the probability that a randomly selected point within the circle lies inside the right-angled isosceles triangle is \\(\\frac{1}{\\pi}\\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: ambiguous, possible interpretations \n  \u03c0 : \u2115 \u2192 \u2115\n  \n  \u03c0 : \u211d\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\nambiguous, possible interpretations \n  \u03c0 : \u2115 \u2192 \u2115\n  \n  \u03c0 : \u211d\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown namespace 'Real'\nexpected token\nunknown constant 'OfNat'\nunknown constant 'sorryAx'\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: expected token\nunknown constant 'OfNat'\nunknown constant 'sorryAx'\nPlease revise the proof.",

This means that 2/3 of the garden is covered with vegetables, leaving 1/3 of the garden unplanted.\n\n2. **Calculating the Remaining Area:**\n   - Since 2/3 of the garden is used for vegetables, the remaining area of the garden is 1 - 2/3 = 1/3. This is the portion of the garden that is not yet planted with anything.\n\n3. **Planting Flowers in the Remaining Area:**\n   - The farmer then plants flowers in 1/2 of this remaining area.

The integral \\(\\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx = 0\\) suggests that the \"net area\" under the curve of \\( f(x) \\) from \\( a \\) to \\( b \\) is zero. This means that the positive and negative areas under the curve must cancel each other out perfectly.\n\nNow, consider the properties of continuous functions. A key property is the Intermediate Value Theorem, which states that if a function is continuous on a closed interval \\([a, b]\\) and takes on values \\( f(a) \\) and \\( f(b) \\), then it must take on every value between \\( f(a) \\) and \\( f(b) \\) at some point within the interval.\n\nSuppose, for the sake of contradiction, that \\( f(x) \\neq 0 \\) for all \\( x \\) in \\([a, b]\\). This would mean that \\( f(x) \\) is either always positive or always negative throughout the interval. If \\( f(x) \\) were always positive, then the integral \\(\\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx\\) would be positive, because we would be summing positive values over a positive length interval. Similarly, if \\( f(x) \\) were always negative, the integral would be negative. In either case, the integral could not be zero, which contradicts our initial condition that \\(\\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx = 0\\).\n\nTherefore, the assumption that \\( f(x) \\neq 0 \\) for all \\( x \\) in \\([a, b]\\) must be false. This means there must be at least one point \\( c \\) in \\([a, b]\\) where \\( f(c) = 0\\).\n\nThus, we have shown that if the integral of a continuous function over an interval is zero, there must exist some point within that interval where the function itself is zero.\nPrevious attempt failed with: function expected at\n  Icc\nterm has type\n  ?m.386\nfunction expected at\n  Icc\nterm has type\n  ?m.386\nfunction expected at\n  Icc\nterm has type\n  x\u271d\nunsolved goals\nx\u271d : Sort u_1\nIcc : x\u271d\nf : \u211d \u2192 \u211d\na b : \u211d\nhab : a < b\nhf : ContinuousOn f (sorryAx (Set \u211d) true)\nh_int : \u222b (x : \u211d) in a..b, f x = 0\n\u22a2 \u2203 c \u2208 ?m.2720 f a b hab hf h_int c, f c = 0\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'integral_pos_iff_support_of_nonneg_on_Icc'\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\nf : \u211d \u2192 \u211d\na b : \u211d\nhab : a < b\nhf : ContinuousOn f (Set.Icc a b)\nh_int : \u222b (x : \u211d) in a..b, f x = 0\nx : \u211d\nhx : x \u2208 Set.Icc a b\nh_nonzero : f x \u2260 0\nh_pos : 0 < |f x|\nh_integral_pos : 0 < \u222b (x : \u211d) in a..b, |f x|\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nunknown identifier 'exists_mem_Icc_of_nonzero_integral'\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'integral_pos_iff_support_of_nonneg_on_Icc.mpr'\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\nf : \u211d \u2192 \u211d\na b : \u211d\nhab : a < b\nhf : ContinuousOn f (Icc a b)\nh_int : \u222b (x : \u211d) in a..b, f x = 0\nx : \u211d\nhx : x \u2208 Icc a b\nh_nonzero : f x \u2260 0\nh_pos : 0 < |f x|\nh_integral_pos : 0 < \u222b (x : \u211d) in a..b, |f x|\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nunknown identifier 'exists_mem_Icc_of_nonzero_integral'\nPlease revise the proof.",

According to the problem, there are 5 red balls, 3 blue balls, and 2 green balls. To find the total number of balls, we simply add these numbers together:\n\n- Number of red balls = 5\n- Number of blue balls = 3\n- Number of green balls = 2\n\nTotal number of balls = 5 (red) + 3 (blue) + 2 (green) = 10 balls.\n\nNext, we focus on the number of favorable outcomes, which in this case is the number of red balls, since we want to find the probability of drawing a red ball. We already know there are 5 red balls.\n\nThe probability of an event is calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes. Here, the favorable outcomes are drawing a red ball, and the total possible outcomes are drawing any ball from the jar.\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing a red ball is:\n\nProbability = (Number of red balls) / (Total number of balls) = 5 / 10.\n\nWe can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 5:\n\n5 / 10 = 1 / 2.\n\nThus, the probability of drawing a red ball from the jar is 1/2, or 50%. This means that if you randomly draw a ball from the jar, there is an equal chance of it being red as there is of it being any other color combined.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

We will use hypothesis testing, specifically a t-test, to assess the significance of the differences.\n\nFirst, let's consider the real parts of the complex numbers. The population mean of the real parts is 5, and the sample mean is 4.8. We have a sample size of 30, which is generally considered large enough to use the t-distribution. The standard deviation of the real parts in the sample is 1.\n\nThe null hypothesis (H0) is that the sample mean of the real parts is equal to the population mean, i.e., there is no significant difference. The alternative hypothesis (H1) is that the sample mean is different from the population mean.\n\nTo perform the t-test, we calculate the t-statistic using the formula:\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{\\bar{x} - \\mu}{s / \\sqrt{n}} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(\\bar{x}\\) is the sample mean (4.8),\n- \\(\\mu\\) is the population mean (5),\n- \\(s\\) is the sample standard deviation (1),\n- \\(n\\) is the sample size (30).\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{4.8 - 5}{1 / \\sqrt{30}} = \\frac{-0.2}{1 / \\sqrt{30}} \\approx -1.095 \\]\n\nNext, we compare this t-statistic to the critical t-value from the t-distribution table for 29 degrees of freedom (n-1) at the 5% significance level (two-tailed). The critical t-value is approximately \u00b12.045.\n\nSince -1.095 is within the range of -2.045 to 2.045, we fail to reject the null hypothesis for the real parts. This means there is no significant difference between the sample mean and the population mean for the real parts at the 5% significance level.\n\nNow, let's consider the imaginary parts. The population mean of the imaginary parts is 3, and the sample mean is 2.9. The standard deviation of the imaginary parts in the sample is 0.8.\n\nUsing the same t-test approach, we calculate the t-statistic for the imaginary parts:\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{2.9 - 3}{0.8 / \\sqrt{30}} = \\frac{-0.1}{0.8 / \\sqrt{30}} \\approx -0.684 \\]\n\nAgain, we compare this t-statistic to the critical t-value of \u00b12.045. Since -0.684 is also within the range of -2.045 to 2.045, we fail to reject the null hypothesis for the imaginary parts as well.\n\nIn conclusion, for both the real and imaginary parts, the sample means are not significantly different from the population means at the 5% level of significance.

The volume \\(V\\) of this parallelepiped is simply the product of its side lengths, given by:\n\n\\[ V = a \\times b \\times c. \\]\n\nNext, we need to consider the sphere that is inscribed within this parallelepiped.

This calculation is straightforward because it involves basic principles of geometry (calculating the volume of a cube) and simple multiplication to find the total mass based on the given density.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'calc'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'calc'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'calc'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

Then, we will compare the volume of the cylinder to twice the area of the circle to see if it is greater.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the area of the circle. The formula for the area of a circle is given by:\n\n\\[ \\text{Area of circle} = \\pi \\times r^2 \\]\n\nwhere \\( r \\) is the radius of the circle. In this case, the radius \\( r \\) is 4 units. Plugging this into the formula, we get:\n\n\\[ \\text{Area of circle} = \\pi \\times 4^2 = 16\\pi \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the volume of the cylinder. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Volume of cylinder} = \\pi \\times r^2 \\times h \\]\n\nwhere \\( r \\) is the radius of the base and \\( h \\) is the height of the cylinder. Here, the radius \\( r \\) is 4 units and the height \\( h \\) is 10 units. Substituting these values into the formula, we have:\n\n\\[ \\text{Volume of cylinder} = \\pi \\times 4^2 \\times 10 = 160\\pi \\]\n\nNow, we need to determine if the volume of the cylinder is more than twice the area of the circle. Twice the area of the circle is:\n\n\\[ 2 \\times \\text{Area of circle} = 2 \\times 16\\pi = 32\\pi \\]\n\nFinally, we compare the volume of the cylinder, \\( 160\\pi \\), with twice the area of the circle, \\( 32\\pi \\). Clearly, \\( 160\\pi \\) is much greater than \\( 32\\pi \\).\n\nTherefore, the volume of the cylinder is indeed more than twice the area of the circle.

        "informal_proof": "# Informal Proof:\n\nTo prove that the Laplace transform of a continuous function is also continuous, let's first understand what the Laplace transform does. The Laplace transform, denoted as $\\laptrans{f}(s)$ for a function $f(t)$, is essentially an integral transform that converts a function of time $t$ into a function of a complex variable $s$. Specifically, it is defined as:\n\n$$ \\laptrans{f}(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} f(t) \\, dt $$\n\nwhere $s$ is a complex number, typically with a positive real part to ensure convergence of the integral.\n\nNow, consider a continuous function $f(t)$ defined on the interval $[0, \\infty)$. The goal is to show that the resulting function $\\laptrans{f}(s)$ is continuous with respect to $s$.\n\n1. **Continuity of $f(t)$**: Since $f(t)$ is continuous, it does not have any jumps or discontinuities. This property is crucial because it ensures that the integral defining the Laplace transform is well-behaved as $t$ varies.\n\n2. **Exponential Decay**: The term $e^{-st}$ in the integral acts as a damping factor. For any fixed $s$ with a positive real part, $e^{-st}$ decreases exponentially as $t$ increases. This ensures that the contribution of $f(t)$ to the integral diminishes for large $t$, making the integral converge.\n\n3. **Dependence on $s$**: The function $\\laptrans{f}(s)$ depends continuously on $s$ because small changes in $s$ lead to small changes in the value of the integral. This is due to the fact that the integrand $e^{-st} f(t)$ changes continuously with $s$. Specifically, if $s$ changes slightly, the exponential term $e^{-st}$ changes slightly, and since $f(t)$ is continuous, the product $e^{-st} f(t)$ remains continuous in $t$ for each fixed $s$.\n\n4. **Uniform Convergence**: For a fixed $t$, the function $e^{-st}$ is continuous in $s$. Since $f(t)$ is bounded on any finite interval, the product $e^{-st} f(t)$ is also continuous in $s$. The integral of a continuous function with respect to $t$ over a fixed interval is continuous in $s$. Moreover, the exponential decay ensures that the integral converges uniformly for $s$ with a sufficiently large real part, which further supports the continuity of the Laplace transform.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: By the properties of integration and the continuity of the integrand with respect to $s$, the Laplace transform $\\laptrans{f}(s)$ is continuous in $s$. This means that for any small change in $s$, the value of $\\laptrans{f}(s)$ changes only slightly, which is the definition of continuity.\n\nThus, we have shown that the Laplace transform of a continuous function is itself a continuous function of the complex variable $s$.\nPrevious attempt failed with: invalid field notation, type is not of the form (C ...) where C is a constant\n  set\nhas type\n  ?m.242 \u2192 ?m.243 PUnit.{?u.241 + 1}\nunknown identifier 'complex.exp'\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.measureSpace', and it does not have executable code\nfunction expected at\n  continuous\nterm has type\n  x\u271d\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: expected token\nunknown identifier 'continuous_of_continuous_on_of_isCompact'\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: expected token\nunknown identifier 'continuous_of_continuous_on_of_isCompact'\nPlease revise the proof.",

Polynomial functions are continuous everywhere, and in particular, they are continuous on any closed interval \\([a, b]\\). This continuity is crucial because it allows us to apply the Extreme Value Theorem, which states that a continuous function on a closed interval attains both a minimum and a maximum value.\n\nAccording to the problem, the dataset shows that the minimum value of \\( f(x) \\) on \\([a, b]\\) is \\( k \\) and the maximum value is \\( m \\). This means there exist points \\( x_1, x_2 \\in [a, b] \\) such that \\( f(x_1) = k \\) and \\( f(x_2) = m \\).\n\nNow, let's consider the integral of \\( f(x) \\) from \\( a \\) to \\( b \\), denoted as \\(\\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx\\). The Mean Value Theorem for Integrals tells us that for a continuous function on \\([a, b]\\), there exists some \\( c \\in [a, b] \\) such that:\n\n\\[\n\\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx = f(c) \\cdot (b-a)\n\\]\n\nThis equation implies that the integral of the function over the interval is equal to the function's value at some point \\( c \\) in the interval, multiplied by the length of the interval \\((b-a)\\).\n\nSince \\( f(x) \\) is continuous and attains its minimum value \\( k \\) and maximum value \\( m \\) on \\([a, b]\\), it follows that for any \\( x \\in [a, b] \\), including the point \\( c \\), the value of \\( f(x) \\) is bounded by \\( k \\) and \\( m \\). Therefore, we have:\n\n\\[\nk \\leq f(c) \\leq m\n\\]\n\nMultiplying this inequality by \\((b-a)\\), we get:\n\n\\[\nk \\cdot (b-a) \\leq f(c) \\cdot (b-a) \\leq m \\cdot (b-a)\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the expression for the integral from the Mean Value Theorem, we have:\n\n\\[\n(b-a)k \\leq \\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx \\leq (b-a)m\n\\]\n\nThis shows that the definite integral of \\( f(x) \\) over \\([a, b]\\) is indeed greater than or equal to \\((b-a)k\\) and less than or equal to \\((b-a)m\\), as required.

Specifically, if we have two integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), and we know that \\( a \\) is more than \\( b \\), this is expressed mathematically as \\( a > b \\).\n\nNow, let's break down what \\( a > b \\) implies. By definition, \\( a > b \\) means that the difference between \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) is positive. In other words, if you subtract \\( b \\) from \\( a \\), the result should be greater than zero. Mathematically, this is written as:\n\n\\[ a - b > 0. \\]\n\nThis is a direct consequence of the definition of the \"greater than\" relation for integers. If \\( a \\) is greater than \\( b \\), then moving \\( b \\) to the other side of the inequality by subtraction gives us a positive result.\n\nNext, let's consider the reverse situation: what happens when we subtract \\( a \\) from \\( b \\)? If \\( a > b \\), then \\( b \\) is less than \\( a \\). Subtracting a larger number (\\( a \\)) from a smaller number (\\( b \\)) will yield a negative result. This is expressed as:\n\n\\[ b - a < 0. \\]\n\nThis inequality is simply the flip side of the first one. If \\( a - b > 0 \\), then naturally, \\( b - a \\) must be less than zero because you are essentially reversing the subtraction order, which reverses the sign of the result.\n\nIn summary, the statement \"if \\( a \\) is more than \\( b \\), then \\( a - b \\) is greater than 0 and \\( b - a \\) is less than 0\" is a direct consequence of the properties of integer subtraction and the definition of the \"greater than\" relation. When one integer is greater than another, subtracting the smaller from the larger gives a positive result, and subtracting the larger from the smaller gives a negative result.

This is because the partial derivatives represent the rate of change of the function in the directions of the coordinate axes. If both are zero, it suggests that there is no immediate increase or decrease in the function value in the vicinity of the point \\( (a, b) \\) along the x-axis or y-axis.\n\nTo understand why this implies a local extremum, consider the following reasoning:\n\n1. **Directional Derivatives**: The zero partial derivatives imply that the directional derivatives in the directions of the x-axis and y-axis are zero. This means that if you move a small amount in either the x or y direction from \\( (a, b) \\), the function value does not change to the first order. \n\n2. **Critical Point**: The point \\( (a, b) \\) is a critical point of the function \\( f \\). In the context of multivariable calculus, a critical point is where the gradient of the function (a vector of all first partial derivatives) is zero. This is analogous to the one-dimensional case where the derivative is zero at a critical point.\n\n3. **Second Derivative Test**: In one dimension, we often use the second derivative test to determine the nature of a critical point. Similarly, in two dimensions, we can use the second derivative test (involving the Hessian matrix) to determine whether the critical point is a local minimum, local maximum, or a saddle point. However, the problem only asks us to show that there is a local extremum, not to classify it.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since both partial derivatives are zero, and assuming the function is well-behaved (i.e., continuous and differentiable), the point \\( (a, b) \\) is a candidate for a local extremum. The zero partial derivatives indicate that the function does not have a linear increase or decrease in any small neighborhood around \\( (a, b) \\), suggesting that \\( f \\) has a local extremum at this point.\n\nThus, the condition of zero partial derivatives at \\( (a, b) \\) strongly suggests that \\( f \\) has a local extremum at this point, similar to how a zero derivative in one dimension indicates a local extremum.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unexpected token '\u2202'; expected term\nunexpected token '\u2202'; expected term\nunexpected token '\u2202'; expected term\nunsolved goals\ncase h_critical\nf : \u211d \u00d7 \u211d \u2192 \u211d\nhf : Differentiable \u211d f\na b : \u211d\nh_partial_x : sorryAx (Sort ?u.1244) true\nh_partial_y : sorryAx (Sort ?u.1246) true\n\u22a2 (v : \u211d \u00d7 \u211d) \u2192 v \u2260 0 \u2192 sorryAx (Sort ?u.2604) true\n\nf : \u211d \u00d7 \u211d \u2192 \u211d\nhf : Differentiable \u211d f\na b : \u211d\nh_partial_x : sorryAx (Sort ?u.1244) true\nh_partial_y : sorryAx (Sort ?u.1246) true\nh_critical : (v : \u211d \u00d7 \u211d) \u2192 v \u2260 0 \u2192 sorryAx (Sort ?u.2604) true\n\u22a2 \u2203 \u03b5 > 0, \u2200 (x y : \u211d), (x - a) ^ 2 + (y - b) ^ 2 < \u03b5 ^ 2 \u2192 f (x, y) \u2264 f (a, b) \u2228 f (x, y) \u2265 f (a, b)\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unexpected token '\u2202'; expected term\nunexpected token '\u2202'; expected term\nunexpected token '\u2202'; expected term\nunsolved goals\ncase h_critical\nf : \u211d \u00d7 \u211d \u2192 \u211d\nhf : Differentiable \u211d f\na b : \u211d\nh_partial_x : sorryAx (Sort ?u.1244) true\nh_partial_y : sorryAx (Sort ?u.1246) true\n\u22a2 (v : \u211d \u00d7 \u211d) \u2192 v \u2260 0 \u2192 sorryAx (Sort ?u.2835) true\n\nf : \u211d \u00d7 \u211d \u2192 \u211d\nhf : Differentiable \u211d f\na b : \u211d\nh_partial_x : sorryAx (Sort ?u.1244) true\nh_partial_y : sorryAx (Sort ?u.1246) true\nh_critical : (v : \u211d \u00d7 \u211d) \u2192 v \u2260 0 \u2192 sorryAx (Sort ?u.2835) true\n\u22a2 \u2203 \u03b5 > 0, \u2200 (x y : \u211d), (x - a) ^ 2 + (y - b) ^ 2 < \u03b5 ^ 2 \u2192 f (x, y) \u2264 f (a, b) \u2228 f (x, y) \u2265 f (a, b)\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unexpected token '\u2202'; expected term\nunexpected token '\u2202'; expected term\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "# Informal Proof:\n\nTo understand why the product of two negative numbers is positive, let's start by considering what it means for a number to be negative. A negative number is any real number that is less than zero. So, if we have two negative numbers, say \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), both are less than zero.\n\nNow, let's think about multiplication in terms of repeated addition. When we multiply two numbers, we are essentially adding one of the numbers to itself repeatedly, the number of times specified by the other number. However, with negative numbers, this concept can be a bit abstract, so let's use a simpler approach.\n\nConsider the number line. If you multiply a positive number by a negative number, you are essentially taking steps in the opposite direction on the number line. For example, multiplying \\( 3 \\) by \\(-2\\) means you take three steps of size \\(-2\\), ending up at \\(-6\\). This is why a positive times a negative is negative.\n\nNow, let's apply this idea to two negative numbers. Suppose we have \\(-a\\) and \\(-b\\), where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are positive. The product \\((-a) \\times (-b)\\) can be thought of as reversing the direction twice. The first negative sign reverses the direction, and the second negative sign reverses it again, bringing us back to the original direction. This is akin to saying \"the opposite of the opposite,\" which brings us back to the positive.\n\nAnother way to see this is through the properties of numbers. The real numbers form a mathematical structure known as a ring, which has specific rules for addition and multiplication. One of these rules is that the product of two negative elements in a ring is positive. This is a well-established property of real numbers.\n\nTo sum up, when you multiply two negative numbers, the negative signs effectively cancel each other out, resulting in a positive product. This is why the product of two negative numbers is positive.",

The derivative of a function at a point gives us the slope of the tangent line to the function at that point. If \\( f'(x) = 0 \\) for all \\( x \\) in \\((x_1, x_2)\\), it means that the tangent line is horizontal at every point in this interval. In other words, the function \\( f \\) does not increase or decrease; it remains constant throughout the interval.\n\nNow, consider the implications of \\( f \\) being constant on \\((x_1, x_2)\\). If a function is constant on an interval, it means that the function takes the same value at every point within that interval. Therefore, if you pick any two points within \\((x_1, x_2)\\), the function values at these points must be the same.\n\nSince \\( f \\) is constant on \\((x_1, x_2)\\), it follows that the function value at \\( x_1 \\) is the same as the function value at \\( x_2 \\). Thus, we have \\( f(x_1) = f(x_2) \\).\n\nThis conclusion aligns with our understanding of constant functions and the role of derivatives.

The function \\( f(x) \\) is a complex-valued function because it includes both real and imaginary parts.

So, the new dimensions of the entire structure (garden plus path) are:\n\n- New length = 6 meters (original length) + 1 meter (path on one side) + 1 meter (path on the other side) = 8 meters\n- New width = 4 meters (original width) + 1 meter (path on one side) + 1 meter (path on the other side) = 6 meters\n\nNow, we calculate the total area of the new structure, which includes both the garden and the path. The area of this larger rectangle is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total area (garden + path)} = 8 \\times 6 = 48 \\text{ square meters} \\]\n\nThe fraction of the total area that is occupied by the garden is the area of the garden divided by the total area of the garden plus the path. So, we have:\n\n\\[ \\text{Fraction occupied by the garden} = \\frac{\\text{Area of the garden}}{\\text{Total area (garden + path)}} = \\frac{24}{48} \\]\n\nSimplifying this fraction gives:\n\n\\[ \\frac{24}{48} = \\frac{1}{2} \\]\n\nTherefore, the garden occupies \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) or 50% of the total area of the new structure. This means that half of the total area is the garden, and the other half is the path.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  ?m.1871 * 24 / ?m.1871\nh1 : gardenArea = 24\nh2 : totalArea = 48\n\u22a2 24 = 48 / 2\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: no goals to be solved\ninvalid universe level, 0 is not greater than 0\nPlease revise the proof.",

She plans to save all of her allowance for 12 weeks. To find out how much money she saves in total, we multiply her weekly allowance by the number of weeks she saves:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total savings} = 5 \\text{ dollars/week} \\times 12 \\text{ weeks} = 60 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n   So, after 12 weeks, Alice has saved $60.\n\n2. **Toy Purchase:**\n   Alice originally intended to buy a toy worth $60. However, she finds the same toy on sale for $40. She decides to purchase the toy at this reduced price. Therefore, she spends $40 on the toy.\n\n3. **Calculating Remaining Money:**\n   To find out how much money Alice has left after buying the toy, we subtract the cost of the toy from her total savings:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Remaining money} = 60 \\text{ dollars} - 40 \\text{ dollars} = 20 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   After purchasing the toy on sale for $40, Alice has $20 left from her savings. This is the amount of money she has remaining after the transaction.\n\nThus, Alice has $20 left after buying the toy on sale.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "# Informal Proof:\n\nTo understand why the median of a set of numbers, when the count of numbers \\( n \\) is even, is the average of the \\((n/2)\\)th and \\((n/2 + 1)\\)th numbers, let's break down the concept of a median and how it applies to an even number of elements.\n\nFirst, recall that the median is a measure of central tendency that represents the middle value of a data set. When the number of elements \\( n \\) is odd, the median is simply the middle number in the sorted list. However, when \\( n \\) is even, there is no single middle number. Instead, the median is defined as the average of the two middle numbers.\n\nLet's consider a set of \\( n \\) numbers arranged in ascending order. Since \\( n \\) is even, we can express \\( n \\) as \\( 2k \\) for some integer \\( k \\). This means our list has exactly \\( 2k \\) numbers.\n\nIn this ordered list, the first half contains the first \\( k \\) numbers, and the second half contains the remaining \\( k \\) numbers. The two middle numbers are the last number of the first half and the first number of the second half. Specifically, these are the \\((n/2)\\)th and \\((n/2 + 1)\\)th numbers in the list.\n\nTo see this more clearly, consider an example with \\( n = 6 \\). The numbers, when sorted, might look like this: \\( a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6 \\). Here, \\( n/2 = 3 \\), so the \\((n/2)\\)th number is \\( a_3 \\), and the \\((n/2 + 1)\\)th number is \\( a_4 \\). The median is then the average of these two numbers: \\((a_3 + a_4) / 2\\).\n\nThis reasoning holds for any even \\( n \\). By taking the average of the \\((n/2)\\)th and \\((n/2 + 1)\\)th numbers, we effectively find the central point between the two middle numbers, which is the definition of the median for an even set of numbers.\n\nThus, the median of a set of \\( n \\) numbers, where \\( n \\) is even, is indeed the average of the \\((n/2)\\)th and \\((n/2 + 1)\\)th numbers when the numbers are arranged in ascending order.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown constant 'Nat.div_ne_zero'\nexpected type must not contain free or meta variables\n  0 < ?m.12234\nunknown constant 'Nat.div_ne_zero'\nexpected type must not contain free or meta variables\n  0 < ?m.22683\nunknown constant 'Nat.div_ne_zero'\nexpected type must not contain free or meta variables\n  0 < ?m.33133\nunsolved goals\nn : \u2115\nhn : n % 2 = 0\na : Fin n \u2192 \u2115\nmid1\u271d : \u2115 := n / 2\nmid2\u271d : \u2115 := mid1\u271d + 1\nsorted : \u2200 \u2983i j : Fin n\u2984, i < j \u2192 a i \u2264 a j\n\u22a2 a \u27e8mid1\u271d - 1, \u22ef\u27e9 + a \u27e81 + mid1\u271d - 1, \u22ef\u27e9 = a \u27e8mid1\u271d - 1, \u22ef\u27e9 * 2\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: omega could not prove the goal:\nNo usable constraints found.

This is a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients.\n\nThe characteristic equation for the differential equation \\( y'' - y = 0 \\) is obtained by assuming a solution of the form \\( y = e^{rx} \\), where \\( r \\) is a constant. Substituting this into the differential equation gives:\n\n\\[ r^2 e^{rx} - e^{rx} = 0 \\]\n\nFactoring out \\( e^{rx} \\) (which is never zero), we get:\n\n\\[ r^2 - 1 = 0 \\]\n\nSolving this characteristic equation, we find the roots \\( r = 1 \\) and \\( r = -1 \\). These roots are real and distinct, so the general solution to the differential equation is:\n\n\\[ y = C_1 e^x + C_2 e^{-x} \\]\n\nwhere \\( C_1 \\) and \\( C_2 \\) are constants to be determined by the initial conditions.\n\nNow, we apply the initial conditions to find these constants. First, using \\( y(0) = 1 \\):\n\n\\[ y(0) = C_1 e^0 + C_2 e^0 = C_1 + C_2 = 1 \\]\n\nNext, we differentiate the general solution to find \\( y'(x) \\):\n\n\\[ y' = C_1 e^x - C_2 e^{-x} \\]\n\nApplying the initial condition \\( y'(0) = 0 \\):\n\n\\[ y'(0) = C_1 e^0 - C_2 e^0 = C_1 - C_2 = 0 \\]\n\nNow we have a system of two equations:\n\n1. \\( C_1 + C_2 = 1 \\)\n2. \\( C_1 - C_2 = 0 \\)\n\nSolving this system, we add the two equations to eliminate \\( C_2 \\):\n\n\\[ (C_1 + C_2) + (C_1 - C_2) = 1 + 0 \\]\n\\[ 2C_1 = 1 \\]\n\\[ C_1 = \\frac{1}{2} \\]\n\nSubstituting \\( C_1 = \\frac{1}{2} \\) into the first equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2} + C_2 = 1 \\]\n\\[ C_2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\]\n\nThus, the particular solution satisfying the initial conditions is:\n\n\\[ y = \\frac{1}{2} e^x + \\frac{1}{2} e^{-x} \\]\n\nNow, regarding the alternate coordinate system defined by the vectors \\( v_1 = (1,0) \\) and \\( v_2 = (0,1) \\), these vectors represent the standard basis in \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\). The solution \\( y = \\frac{1}{2} e^x + \\frac{1}{2} e^{-x} \\) is already expressed in terms of the standard basis functions \\( e^x \\) and \\( e^{-x} \\), which correspond to the directions of growth and decay, respectively.\n\nTherefore, in this alternate coordinate system, the solution remains the same, as the basis vectors \\( v_1 \\) and \\( v_2 \\) do not alter the form of the solution. The solution in the new coordinate system is still:\n\n\\[ y = \\frac{1}{2} e^x + \\frac{1}{2} e^{-x} \\]\n\nThis completes the informal proof of finding the solution to the differential equation in the given coordinate system.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\ncompiler IR check failed at 'general_sol', error: unknown declaration 'Real.exp'\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\napplication type mismatch\n  particular_sol x\nargument\n  x\nhas type\n  Set \u211d : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u211d : Type\nfailed to synthesize\n  HSub (Set \u211d) \u211d ?m.6832\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'particular_sol', and it does not have executable code\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  HSub \u211d \u2115 (\u211d \u2192 \u211d)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\ncompiler IR check failed at 'general_sol', error: unknown declaration 'Real.exp'\nfailed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instLinearOrderedField', and it does not have executable code\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nunknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",
