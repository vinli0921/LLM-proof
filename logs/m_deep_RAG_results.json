        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to show that the volume of a cone with a base area of 30 square units and a height of 6.5 units is 65 cubic units. \n\nFirst, I remember the formula for the volume of a cone is given as V = (1/3)Bh, where B is the area of the base and h is the height. The problem states that B is 30 and h is 6.5. So, plugging those values into the formula should give the volume.\n\nBut wait, the problem also says to \"show that it is 65,\" so I need to verify that the calculation indeed results in 65. Let me do the math. Multiply 30 (the base area) by 6.5 (the height), which gives 30 * 6.5. Let me compute that: 30 times 6 is 180, and 30 times 0.5 is 15, so adding those gives 195. Then, taking one-third of 195: 195 divided by 3 is 65. That checks out.\n\nBut maybe I should explain why the formula V = (1/3)Bh is valid in the first place. The context provided mentions that the volume of a cone is a third of the volume of a cylinder with the same base and height. The cylinder's volume is Bh, so dividing that by 3 gives the cone's volume. That makes sense because if you imagine filling the cone three times, it would fill the cylinder completely. This relationship is established in the theorem provided, so referencing that would strengthen the explanation.\n\nSo putting it all together: start with the formula, substitute the given values, perform the multiplication and division step by step to show each part leads to 65. Also, mention the theorem that connects the cone's volume to the cylinder's volume to justify the formula's structure. This way, the proof is both computational and conceptual, ensuring that the answer is not just correct but also understood in context.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo find the volume of the cone, we start with the formula for the volume of a cone: \\( V = \\frac{1}{3}Bh \\), where \\( B \\) is the area of the base and \\( h \\) is the height. Here, the base area \\( B \\) is given as \\( 30 \\) square units, and the height \\( h \\) is \\( 6.5 \\) units. \n\nFirst, substitute the given values into the formula:\n\\[\nV = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 30 \\times 6.5.\n\\]\n\nLet\u2019s compute \\( 30 \\times 6.5 \\). Breaking this down:\n- \\( 30 \\times 6 = 180 \\),\n- \\( 30 \\times 0.5 = 15 \\),\n- Adding these gives \\( 180 + 15 = 195 \\).\n\nNow, multiply \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\times 195 \\):\n\\[\n\\frac{195}{3} = 65.\n\\]\n\nThus, the volume of the cone is \\( 65 \\) cubic units. \n\n**Why does the formula \\( \\frac{1}{3}Bh \\) work?**  \nThe formula comes from the relationship between a cone and a cylinder with the same base and height. A cylinder\u2019s volume is \\( Bh \\), and it\u2019s proven that a cone\u2019s volume is exactly one-third of the cylinder\u2019s volume. This is why we multiply \\( Bh \\) by \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\). The substitution and arithmetic confirm the final result of \\( 65 \\).",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to show that there are no integers x and y such that 4x\u00b3 - 7y\u00b3 = 2003. Hmm. So, how do I approach this? Maybe start by looking at the equation modulo some number to find a contradiction. That's a common technique in number theory for showing equations have no solutions.\n\nFirst, let me think about modulo 7. Because there's a 7y\u00b3 term. If I take the equation modulo 7, the term -7y\u00b3 becomes 0 modulo 7. So the equation simplifies to 4x\u00b3 \u2261 2003 mod 7. Let me compute 2003 mod 7. Let's divide 2003 by 7. 7*286 = 2002, so 2003 is 2002 +1, so 2003 \u22611 mod7. Therefore, 4x\u00b3 \u22611 mod7. Then, multiplying both sides by the inverse of 4 mod7. The inverse of 4 mod7 is 2 because 4*2=8\u22611 mod7. So x\u00b3 \u22612*1=2 mod7. So x\u00b3 \u22612 mod7. Now, what are the possible cubes modulo7? Let's compute all cubes mod7. 0\u00b3=0, 1\u00b3=1, 2\u00b3=8\u22611, 3\u00b3=27\u22616, 4\u00b3=64\u22611, 5\u00b3=125\u22616, 6\u00b3=216\u22616. Wait, so the cubes modulo7 are 0,1,1,6,1,6,6. So possible residues are 0,1,6. But we need x\u00b3 \u22612 mod7. But 2 isn't among the possible residues. Therefore, there's no solution modulo7. Hence, the original equation can't have integer solutions. That seems straightforward. But wait, let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the cube calculations. Let me verify:\n\n0\u00b3 mod7 =0\n\n1\u00b3=1 mod7=1\n\n2\u00b3=8 mod7=1\n\n3\u00b3=27 mod7=27-3*7=27-21=6\n\n4\u00b3=64 mod7: 64 divided by7 is 9*7=63, so 64-63=1 \u2192 1\n\n5\u00b3=125: 125-17*7=125-119=6\n\n6\u00b3=216: 216-30*7=216-210=6\n\nYes, so cubes mod7 are 0,1,1,6,1,6,6. So possible residues are 0,1,6. Therefore, 2 is not achievable. Therefore, the equation 4x\u00b3 -7y\u00b3=2003 has no integer solutions because modulo7 leads to a contradiction. That should be the proof. Let me just make sure there's no other modulus that might work better, but modulo7 seems sufficient here. Alternatively, maybe check modulo another number as a cross-check. Let's try modulo4. Let's see. The equation is 4x\u00b3 -7y\u00b3=2003. Taking modulo4: 4x\u00b3 \u22610 mod4, -7y\u00b3 \u2261 (-7 mod4)*y\u00b3. -7 mod4 is 1, since -7 +8=1. So 1*y\u00b3 \u22612003 mod4. 2003 divided by4 is 500*4=2000, so 2003\u22613 mod4. So y\u00b3 \u22613 mod4. Let's see possible cubes mod4. 0\u00b3=0, 1\u00b3=1, 2\u00b3=0, 3\u00b3=3. So possible residues are 0,1,3. So y\u00b3\u22613 mod4 is possible if y\u22613 mod4. So that doesn't give a contradiction. So modulo4 doesn't rule out solutions. Therefore, the modulo7 approach is the key here. So the conclusion is that there are no integer solutions because modulo7 leads to an impossible congruence.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo show that there are no integers \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) satisfying \\( 4x^3 - 7y^3 = 2003 \\), we analyze the equation modulo \\( 7 \\). This approach leverages modular arithmetic to reveal contradictions in possible solutions.\n\nFirst, reduce the equation modulo \\( 7 \\). The term \\( -7y^3 \\) becomes \\( 0 \\mod 7 \\), simplifying the equation to:\n\\[\n4x^3 \\equiv 2003 \\mod 7.\n\\]\nNext, compute \\( 2003 \\mod 7 \\). Since \\( 7 \\times 286 = 2002 \\), we have \\( 2003 \\equiv 1 \\mod 7 \\). Thus:\n\\[\n4x^3 \\equiv 1 \\mod 7.\n\\]\nMultiply both sides by the modular inverse of \\( 4 \\mod 7 \\). The inverse of \\( 4 \\) modulo \\( 7 \\) is \\( 2 \\) (because \\( 4 \\times 2 = 8 \\equiv 1 \\mod 7 \\)), leading to:\n\\[\nx^3 \\equiv 2 \\mod 7.\n\\]\nNow, examine all possible residues of cubes modulo \\( 7 \\). For integers \\( k \\mod 7 \\), compute \\( k^3 \\mod 7 \\):\n- \\( 0^3 \\equiv 0 \\mod 7 \\),\n- \\( 1^3 \\equiv 1 \\mod 7 \\),\n- \\( 2^3 = 8 \\equiv 1 \\mod 7 \\),\n- \\( 3^3 = 27 \\equiv 6 \\mod 7 \\),\n- \\( 4^3 = 64 \\equiv 1 \\mod 7 \\),\n- \\( 5^3 = 125 \\equiv 6 \\mod 7 \\),\n- \\( 6^3 = 216 \\equiv 6 \\mod 7 \\).\n\nThe possible residues of \\( k^3 \\mod 7 \\) are \\( 0, 1, \\) and \\( 6 \\). Notably, \\( 2 \\mod 7 \\) is **not** among these residues. This means there is no integer \\( x \\) such that \\( x^3 \\equiv 2 \\mod 7 \\), creating a contradiction. Therefore, the original equation \\( 4x^3 - 7y^3 = 2003 \\) cannot hold for any integers \\( x \\) and \\( y \\). \n\nThis modular contradiction confirms the absence of solutions.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  (?a - ?b) % ?n\nx y : \u2124\n\u22a2 4 * x ^ 3 - 7 * y ^ 3 % 7 = 2003 % 7\nno goals to be solved\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  ?a % ?n * (?b % ?n) % ?n\nx y : \u2124\nh : 4 * x ^ 3 = 1\nthis : 4 * x ^ 3 % 7 = 1 % 7\n\u22a2 x ^ 3 % 7 = 2 % 7\ntype mismatch\n  this\nhas type\n  x ^ 3 % 7 = 2 % 7 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  7 \u2223 x ^ 3 \u2228 x ^ 3 % 7 = 1 \u2228 x ^ 3 % 7 = 6 : Prop\nunsolved goals\nx y : \u2124\nh : 4 * x ^ 3 = 1\nthis\u271d\u00b9 : 4 * x ^ 3 % 7 = 1 % 7\nthis\u271d : x ^ 3 % 7 = 2 % 7\nthis : 7 \u2223 x ^ 3 \u2228 x ^ 3 % 7 = 1 \u2228 x ^ 3 % 7 = 6\n\u22a2 4 * x ^ 3 - 7 * y ^ 3 \u2260 2003\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the value of log_z w, given some other logarithmic relationships. All the bases x, y, z are greater than 1, and w is a positive number. The given equations are log_x w = 24, log_y w = 40, and log_{xyz} w = 12. The answer is supposed to be 60, but I need to show how that comes about.\n\nFirst, I remember that logarithms can be converted using the change of base formula. Maybe I can express all these logs in terms of a common base, like base 10 or base e. But maybe there's a way to relate them through their definitions.\n\nLet me recall that log_b a = c means that b^c = a. So, log_x w =24 implies that x^24 = w. Similarly, log_y w =40 means y^40 = w. And log_{xyz} w =12 implies that (xyz)^12 = w.\n\nSince all these expressions equal w, I can set them equal to each other. So x^24 = y^40 = (xyz)^12 = w.\n\nHmm, maybe I can express x and y in terms of z, or find a relationship between x, y, z. Let's see. Let me take x^24 = (xyz)^12. Dividing both sides by x^12 gives x^12 = (yz)^12. Taking the 12th root, x = yz. Wait, but that might not be right. Wait, x^24 = (xyz)^12. Let's write that as x^24 = x^12 y^12 z^12. Then, dividing both sides by x^12 gives x^12 = y^12 z^12. Taking the 12th root, x = y z. So x equals y times z. Interesting.\n\nSimilarly, from y^40 = (xyz)^12. Let's substitute x from the previous result. Since x = y z, then xyz becomes y z * y * z = y^2 z^2. Wait, no. Wait, xyz is x*y*z. If x = y z, then xyz = (y z)*y*z = y^2 z^2. So substituting into (xyz)^12 = y^40, we get (y^2 z^2)^12 = y^40. That simplifies to y^{24} z^{24} = y^{40}. Dividing both sides by y^{24}, we get z^{24} = y^{16}. So z^24 = y^16. Then, taking both sides to the power of 1/8, z^3 = y^2. So z^3 = y^2. Therefore, y = z^{3/2}.\n\nWait, maybe there's another approach. Let's use the change of base formula. Since log_x w =24, then log w / log x =24. Similarly, log_y w =40 implies log w / log y =40. And log_{xyz} w =12 implies log w / log(xyz)=12.\n\nLet me denote log as base 10 logarithm for simplicity. Let me set log w = L. Then:\n\nFrom log_x w =24: L / log x =24 \u2192 log x = L /24.\n\nSimilarly, log_y w =40: log y = L /40.\n\nlog_{xyz} w =12: log(xyz) = L /12.\n\nBut log(xyz) = log x + log y + log z. So:\n\nlog x + log y + log z = L /12.\n\nSubstituting log x = L/24 and log y = L/40:\n\nL/24 + L/40 + log z = L/12.\n\nLet me compute L/24 + L/40. Let's find a common denominator, which is 120.\n\nL/24 = 5L/120, L/40 = 3L/120. So 5L/120 +3L/120=8L/120= L/15.\n\nSo L/15 + log z = L/12.\n\nSubtract L/15 from both sides:\n\nlog z = L/12 - L/15 = (5L -4L)/60 = L/60.\n\nTherefore, log z = L/60. But log z is the logarithm of z, and we need to find log_z w. Let's compute log_z w. Using change of base again:\n\nlog_z w = log w / log z = L / (L/60) )=60.\n\nSo log_z w =60. That's the answer. Let me check if this makes sense.\n\nWait, let's verify the steps again. Starting from the equations:\n\nlog_x w =24 \u2192 log w / log x =24 \u2192 log x = log w /24.\n\nSimilarly, log y = log w /40.\n\nlog_{xyz} w =12 \u2192 log w / log(xyz)=12 \u2192 log(xyz)= log w /12.\n\nBut log(xyz)=log x + log y + log z.\n\nSubstituting log x and log y:\n\nlog w /24 + log w /40 + log z = log w /12.\n\nLet me factor out log w:\n\nlog w (1/24 +1/40) + log z = log w /12.\n\nCompute 1/24 +1/40. Let's see, common denominator 120: 5/120 +3/120=8/120=1/15.\n\nSo log w (1/15) + log z = log w /12.\n\nSubtract log w /15 from both sides:\n\nlog z = log w /12 - log w /15 = log w (1/12 -1/15) = log w (5/60 -4/60)= log w (1/60).\n\nTherefore, log z = log w /60.\n\nThen, log_z w = log w / log z = log w / (log w /60) )=60. So yes, that works. Therefore, the answer is 60.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nWe need to find \\(\\log_z w\\) given the conditions \\(\\log_x w = 24\\), \\(\\log_y w = 40\\), and \\(\\log_{xyz} w = 12\\).

This simplifies to \\(y^{40} = y^{24}z^{24}\\), leading to \\(y^{16} = z^{24}\\) or \\(y = z^{3/2}\\).\n\n4. **Use logarithmic identities**:\n   - Apply the change-of-base formula: \\(\\log_x w = \\frac{\\log w}{\\log x} = 24\\), so \\(\\log x = \\frac{\\log w}{24}\\).\n   - Similarly, \\(\\log y = \\frac{\\log w}{40}\\).\n   - For \\(\\log_{xyz} w = 12\\), we have \\(\\frac{\\log w}{\\log(xyz)} = 12\\), so \\(\\log(xyz) = \\frac{\\log w}{12}\\).\n\n5. **Expand \\(\\log(xyz)\\)**:\n   - \\(\\log(xyz) = \\log x + \\log y + \\log z\\).\n   - Substitute \\(\\log x = \\frac{\\log w}{24}\\) and \\(\\log y = \\frac{\\log w}{40}\\):\n     \\[\n     \\frac{\\log w}{24} + \\frac{\\log w}{40} + \\log z = \\frac{\\log w}{12}.\n     \\]\n   - Combine terms: \\(\\log w \\left(\\frac{1}{24} + \\frac{1}{40}\\right) + \\log z = \\frac{\\log w}{12}\\).\n   - Simplify \\(\\frac{1}{24} + \\frac{1}{40} = \\frac{1}{15}\\), giving:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{\\log w}{15} + \\log z = \\frac{\\log w}{12}.\n     \\]\n   - Solve for \\(\\log z\\):\n     \\[\n     \\log z = \\frac{\\log w}{12} - \\frac{\\log w}{15} = \\frac{\\log w}{60}.\n     \\]\n\n6. **Compute \\(\\log_z w\\)**:\n   - Using \\(\\log_z w = \\frac{\\log w}{\\log z}\\), substitute \\(\\log z = \\frac{\\log w}{60}\\):\n     \\[\n     \\log_z w = \\frac{\\log w}{\\frac{\\log w}{60}} = 60.\n     \\]\n\nThus, \\(\\log_z w = 60\\).

The options are given, and we need to show that the correct answer is option D: 10000! divided by (2^5000 times 5000!). \n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly the product of all positive odd integers less than 10000 is. So, that would be 1 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 ... \u00d7 9999. Since 10000 is even, the largest odd integer less than 10000 is 9999. \n\nNow, how can this product be expressed in terms of factorials?

The even numbers can be written as 2 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 ... \u00d7 10000. Each of these even numbers is 2 times an integer. So, 2 \u00d7 1, 2 \u00d7 2, 2 \u00d7 3, ..., up to 2 \u00d7 5000. Because 10000 divided by 2 is 5000. Therefore, the product of the even numbers is 2^5000 multiplied by 5000! (since each term is 2 times a number from 1 to 5000). \n\nSo, 10000! = (product of odds) \u00d7 (product of evens) = (product of odds) \u00d7 (2^5000 \u00d7 5000!). Therefore, if we solve for the product of odds, it would be 10000! divided by (2^5000 \u00d7 5000!), which is exactly option D. \n\nWait, let me check that again. The product of evens is 2\u00d74\u00d76\u00d7...\u00d710000. That's 2^5000 times 1\u00d72\u00d73\u00d7...\u00d75000, which is 5000!. So yes, the product of evens is 2^5000 \u00d7 5000!. Therefore, the product of odds is 10000! divided by (2^5000 \u00d7 5000!). \n\nBut let me make sure there's no mistake here. Let's take a smaller example. Suppose instead of 10000, take n=4. Then the product of odd integers less than 4 is 1\u00d73. The product of evens is 2\u00d74. The total factorial 4! = 24. Then according to the formula, it should be 4! / (2^2 \u00d7 2!) = 24 / (4\u00d72) = 24/8 = 3, which is indeed 1\u00d73. That works. \n\nAnother example: n=6. Odds: 1\u00d73\u00d75. Evens: 2\u00d74\u00d76 = 2^3 \u00d7 3! = 8\u00d76 = 48. 6! = 720. Then 720 / (8\u00d76) = 720 / 48 = 15, which is 1\u00d73\u00d75. Correct. \n\nSo the formula seems to hold. Therefore, the general approach is correct. The key idea is separating the factorial into even and odd parts, expressing the even part as 2^k times k! where k is half of n (if n is even). Then the product of odds is n! divided by (2^k \u00d7 k!). \n\nIn the problem, n is 10000, so k is 5000. Hence, the product of odds is 10000! / (2^5000 \u00d7 5000!), which is option D. \n\nI think that's solid. The answer is D.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo find the product of all positive odd integers less than 10,000 (i.e., \\(1 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times \\dots \\times 9999\\)), we start by observing that \\(10,\\!000!\\) (the factorial of 10,000) includes the product of *all* integers from 1 to 10,000. This product can be split into two parts: the product of **even integers** and the product of **odd integers**. \n\nLet\u2019s analyze the even integers first. The even numbers between 1 and 10,000 are \\(2, 4, 6, \\dots, 10,\\!000\\). There are \\(5,\\!000\\) such terms, and each can be written as \\(2 \\times k\\), where \\(k\\) runs from 1 to 5,000. Thus, the product of all even integers is:\n\\[\n(2 \\times 1) \\times (2 \\times 2) \\times \\dots \\times (2 \\times 5,\\!000) = 2^{5,\\!000} \\times (1 \\times 2 \\times \\dots \\times 5,\\!000) = 2^{5,\\!000} \\times 5,\\!000!.\n\\]\n\nNow, since \\(10,\\!000! = (\\text{product of odd integers}) \\times (\\text{product of even integers})\\), we can solve for the product of odd integers:\n\\[\n\\text{Product of odds} = \\frac{10,\\!000!}{\\text{Product of evens}} = \\frac{10,\\!000!}{2^{5,\\!000} \\times 5,\\!000!}.\n\\]\n\nThis matches option **(D)**. To verify, consider smaller examples. For instance, if \\(n = 4\\), the product of odds \\(1 \\times 3\\) equals \\(4! / (2^2 \\times 2!) = 24 / (4 \\times 2) = 3\\), which is correct. The same logic scales to \\(n = 10,\\!000\\), confirming that the answer is indeed \\(\\dfrac{10,\\!000!}{2^{5,\\!000} \\cdot 5,\\!000!}\\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: \nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown constant 'Finset.prod_range_id'\nunknown constant 'Nat.mod_two_eq_zero_iff_even'\nunknown constant 'Nat.mod_two_eq_one_iff_odd'\ntactic 'simp' failed, nested error:\nmaximum recursion depth has been reached\nuse `set_option maxRecDepth <num>` to increase limit\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: \nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a rectangular patio with an area of 180 square feet and a perimeter of 54 feet. We need to find the length of the diagonal squared and show that it's 369. Hmm, right.\n\nFirst, I remember that for a rectangle, the area is length times width, and the perimeter is twice the sum of length and width. Let me denote the length as 'l' and the width as 'w'. So, the area equation is l * w = 180. The perimeter equation would be 2(l + w) = 54. Let me simplify that perimeter equation first. Dividing both sides by 2 gives l + w = 27. So, the sum of length and width is 27.\n\nNow, we need to find the diagonal squared. I recall from the Pythagorean theorem that the diagonal of a rectangle, d, satisfies d\u00b2 = l\u00b2 + w\u00b2. So, our goal is to find l\u00b2 + w\u00b2. But how do we get that from the given information?\n\nWe have l + w = 27 and l * w = 180. Maybe we can use these to find l\u00b2 + w\u00b2. Let me think. There's a formula that relates (l + w)\u00b2 to l\u00b2 + w\u00b2. Expanding (l + w)\u00b2 gives l\u00b2 + 2lw + w\u00b2. So, (l + w)\u00b2 = l\u00b2 + 2lw + w\u00b2. Therefore, l\u00b2 + w\u00b2 = (l + w)\u00b2 - 2lw. \n\nPlugging in the known values: l + w is 27, so (27)\u00b2 = 729. And 2lw is 2 times 180, which is 360. So, l\u00b2 + w\u00b2 = 729 - 360 = 369. That's exactly the diagonal squared. So, d\u00b2 = 369. Therefore, the length of the diagonal squared is 369. That matches what we needed to show. Let me double-check the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The perimeter equation was simplified correctly, the area is given, and using the algebraic identity to find l\u00b2 + w\u00b2 seems right. Yep, everything checks out.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nLet's start by letting the length and width of the rectangular patio be \\( l \\) and \\( w \\), respectively. We know two key facts:\n\n1. **Area**: \\( l \\times w = 180 \\)  \n2. **Perimeter**: \\( 2(l + w) = 54 \\), which simplifies to \\( l + w = 27 \\).\n\nOur goal is to find the square of the diagonal of the rectangle. By the Pythagorean theorem, the diagonal \\( d \\) satisfies:  \n\\[\nd^2 = l^2 + w^2.\n\\]\n\nTo compute \\( l^2 + w^2 \\), we use the algebraic identity:  \n\\[\n(l + w)^2 = l^2 + 2lw + w^2.\n\\]\n\nRearranging this, we get:  \n\\[\nl^2 + w^2 = (l + w)^2 - 2lw.\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the known values:  \n- \\( l + w = 27 \\), so \\( (l + w)^2 = 27^2 = 729 \\).  \n- \\( l \\times w = 180 \\), so \\( 2lw = 2 \\times 180 = 360 \\).\n\nThus:  \n\\[\nl^2 + w^2 = 729 - 360 = 369.\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the square of the diagonal is **369**, as required.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is asking for the units digit of the sum of the squares of the first nine positive integers. And we need to show that it's 5. Hmm. Alright, so first, I need to figure out what the sum of the squares from 1\u00b2 to 9\u00b2 is, and then look at the last digit of that sum.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a formula for the sum of squares of the first n positive integers. I remember there's a formula like n(n+1)(2n+1)/6. Let me check that. For n=9, plugging into the formula would give 9*10*19/6. Let me compute that. 9*10 is 90, times 19 is 1710. Divided by 6 is 285. So the sum is 285. Then the units digit is 5. Oh, that's straightforward. But maybe the problem expects me to compute each square and add them up manually to confirm, especially if the formula isn't recalled.\n\nAlternatively, if I don't remember the formula, I can just calculate each square from 1 to 9 and add them step by step. Let's try that approach to verify.\n\n1\u00b2 = 1\n\n2\u00b2 = 4 \u2192 total so far: 1+4=5\n\n3\u00b2 =9 \u2192 total:5+9=14\n\n4\u00b2=16 \u2192 total:14+16=30\n\n5\u00b2=25 \u2192 total:30+25=55\n\n6\u00b2=36 \u2192 total:55+36=91\n\n7\u00b2=49 \u2192 total:91+49=140\n\n8\u00b2=64 \u2192 total:140+64=204\n\n9\u00b2=81 \u2192 total:204+81=285\n\nYes, the total is 285. The units digit is the last digit, which is 5. So that's the answer. But maybe I should explain why the formula works, or at least confirm that using the formula gives the same result. Wait, the problem just wants the units digit, so even if I use the formula, the calculation leads to 285, which ends with 5. Therefore, the units digit is 5. That seems solid. I don't see any mistakes here. Both methods\u2014direct calculation and using the formula\u2014lead to the same conclusion. So the proof is straightforward once you compute the sum correctly.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo determine the units digit of the sum of the squares of the first nine positive integers, we first compute the sum itself. Let's calculate each square individually and add them step by step:\n\n- \\(1^2 = 1\\)  \n- \\(2^2 = 4\\) \u2192 Total: \\(1 + 4 = 5\\)  \n- \\(3^2 = 9\\) \u2192 Total: \\(5 + 9 = 14\\)  \n- \\(4^2 = 16\\) \u2192 Total: \\(14 + 16 = 30\\)  \n- \\(5^2 = 25\\) \u2192 Total: \\(30 + 25 = 55\\)  \n- \\(6^2 = 36\\) \u2192 Total: \\(55 + 36 = 91\\)  \n- \\(7^2 = 49\\) \u2192 Total: \\(91 + 49 = 140\\)  \n- \\(8^2 = 64\\) \u2192 Total: \\(140 + 64 = 204\\)  \n- \\(9^2 = 81\\) \u2192 Total: \\(204 + 81 = 285\\)  \n\nThe final sum is \\(285\\). The **units digit** is the last digit of this number, which is **5**.

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, we have this function f(x) which is a sum of cosines with different amplitudes and phases. Each term is (1/2^{k-1}) times cos(a_k + x), right? And we're told that f(x1) and f(x2) are both zero. We need to show that the difference between x2 and x1 is an integer multiple of \u03c0.\n\nHmm, first, I need to recall some trigonometric identities or properties that might help here. The problem reminds me of functions that can be expressed in terms of sine or cosine with phase shifts. Maybe we can rewrite f(x) in a different form that makes the relationship between x1 and x2 clearer.\n\nLet me think. Each term in f(x) is a cosine function with a phase shift a_k and variable x. The coefficients are decreasing by a factor of 1/2 each time. So, the function is a weighted sum of cosines, each shifted by a different constant a_k but all sharing the same variable x. The weights form a geometric sequence with ratio 1/2.\n\nWait, if we factor out cos(x) and sin(x) using trigonometric identities, maybe we can express f(x) as a single cosine (or sine) function with some amplitude and phase shift. That might simplify things. Because if f(x) can be written as C cos(x + \u03c6), then its zeros would be spaced \u03c0 apart, which would directly give x2 - x1 = m\u03c0. But here, the function is a sum of multiple cosines with different phases. However, the coefficients are specific: each term is half the previous one. That seems like a geometric series. Maybe there's a way to sum this series?\n\nAlternatively, consider that each term can be written as (1/2^{k-1}) cos(a_k + x). Let's see, if we let \u03b8 = x, then each term is (1/2^{k-1}) cos(a_k + \u03b8). If we can express this sum as a product or another form, that might help. But I'm not sure. Let's think about the structure of f(x).\n\nAnother approach: since f(x) is a sum of cosines, maybe we can represent each cosine term using complex exponentials. Euler's formula tells us that cos(\u03b1) = (e^{i\u03b1} + e^{-i\u03b1}) / 2. So, substituting that into f(x), we might get a sum of complex exponentials which could be simplified.\n\nLet's try that. So, f(x) = \u03a3_{k=1}^n [1/2^{k-1} * (e^{i(a_k + x)} + e^{-i(a_k + x)}) / 2]. Simplifying, that's (1/2) \u03a3_{k=1}^n [1/2^{k-1} e^{i(a_k + x)} + 1/2^{k-1} e^{-i(a_k + x)}]. Hmm, this splits into two sums: one with positive exponents and one with negative. Let's factor out e^{ix} and e^{-ix} from each sum respectively.\n\nSo, f(x) = (1/2) [e^{ix} \u03a3_{k=1}^n (1/2^{k-1} e^{i a_k}) + e^{-ix} \u03a3_{k=1}^n (1/2^{k-1} e^{-i a_k})]. Let's denote the first sum as S = \u03a3_{k=1}^n (1/2^{k-1} e^{i a_k}) and the second sum as S* (the complex conjugate of S, since replacing a_k with -a_k would conjugate each term). So, f(x) = (1/2)(S e^{ix} + S* e^{-ix}).\n\nBut S is a complex number; let's write S as A e^{i\u03c6}, where A is the magnitude and \u03c6 is the argument. Then S* would be A e^{-i\u03c6}. Substituting back, f(x) becomes (1/2)(A e^{i\u03c6} e^{ix} + A e^{-i\u03c6} e^{-ix}) = (A/2)(e^{i(x + \u03c6)} + e^{-i(x + \u03c6)}) = A cos(x + \u03c6). Wait, that's interesting! So, the entire sum f(x) simplifies to A cos(x + \u03c6), where A is the magnitude of the complex sum S, and \u03c6 is its argument. Therefore, f(x) is just a single cosine function with amplitude A and phase shift \u03c6.\n\nIf that's the case, then f(x) = A cos(x + \u03c6). The zeros of this function occur where cos(x + \u03c6) = 0, which happens when x + \u03c6 = \u03c0/2 + m\u03c0 for some integer m. Therefore, the solutions are x = -\u03c6 + \u03c0/2 + m\u03c0. So, the difference between any two zeros x1 and x2 would be (x2 - x1) = ( -\u03c6 + \u03c0/2 + m\u03c0 ) - ( -\u03c6 + \u03c0/2 + k\u03c0 ) = (m - k)\u03c0. Hence, x2 - x1 is an integer multiple of \u03c0, which is exactly what we needed to prove.\n\nBut wait, this relies on the fact that f(x) can indeed be written as a single cosine function. Let me verify that step again. Starting from the sum of cosines with coefficients 1/2^{k-1}, we used Euler's formula and expressed each term as a complex exponential. Then, by factoring out e^{ix} and e^{-ix}, we recognized that the sums over k form complex conjugates. Then, by expressing S in polar form, we combined the exponentials back into a cosine. That seems valid. The key insight here is that the weighted sum of these shifted cosines can be combined into a single cosine function due to the specific geometric coefficients. The geometric series allows the sum to converge (even if n is infinite, but here n is finite, but the structure is similar). However, in this case, since n is finite, S is a finite sum, but the same logic applies: the sum of complex exponentials with geometric coefficients can be written as a single complex exponential times a sum, leading to a single cosine term.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion holds: the zeros of f(x) are spaced \u03c0 apart, so any two zeros differ by an integer multiple of \u03c0. Thus, x2 - x1 = m\u03c0 for some integer m.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo prove that \\( x_2 - x_1 = m\\pi \\) for some integer \\( m \\) when \\( f(x_1) = f(x_2) = 0 \\), we start by analyzing the structure of \\( f(x) \\).

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is about finding the value of f(f(10)) given some information about the inverse function h(x) = f\u207b\u00b9(x). The given conditions are h(2) = 10, h(10) = 1, and h(1) = 2. We need to show that f(f(10)) equals 1.\n\nFirst, I remember that if h is the inverse of f, then by definition of inverse functions, h(f(x)) = x and f(h(x)) = x for all x in the appropriate domains. So, applying h to f(x) gives back x, and vice versa. That's a key point here.\n\nGiven h(2) = 10, this means that f(10) must be 2. Because h is f\u207b\u00b9, h(y) = x implies that f(x) = y. So, if h(2) = 10, then f(10) = 2. That's straightforward from the inverse relationship.\n\nNext, h(10) = 1. Using the same logic, this tells us that f(1) = 10. Because h(10) is the x such that f(x) = 10, so x here is 1. Therefore, f(1) = 10.\n\nThen, h(1) = 2. Applying the inverse function property again, this means f(2) = 1. Because h(1) gives the x where f(x) = 1, which is 2. So, f(2) = 1.\n\nNow, we need to compute f(f(10)). Let's break this down. We already found that f(10) = 2. So, f(f(10)) becomes f(2). And from earlier, we determined that f(2) = 1. Therefore, substituting these values in, f(f(10)) = f(2) = 1.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Starting with f(10) = 2, then applying f again to that result gives f(2). And since h(1) = 2, which implies f(2) = 1. Yes, that seems right. Each step follows from the inverse relationships given by h's values. So putting it all together, f(f(10)) is indeed 1.\n\nI should also consider if there's any possibility of confusion with the composition order, but since we're dealing with function application rather than composition of functions here, the order is straightforward. Each h value directly gives the corresponding f value. No need to reverse the order as in composite functions. The key was translating each h value into the corresponding f value correctly.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nLet's start by recalling that \\( h(x) = f^{-1}(x) \\), meaning \\( h \\) undoes the action of \\( f \\). By definition of inverse functions:\n- \\( f(h(x)) = x \\) for all \\( x \\) in the domain of \\( h \\),\n- \\( h(f(x)) = x \\) for all \\( x \\) in the domain of \\( f \\).\n\n**Step 1: Translate the given \\( h \\)-values into \\( f \\)-values.**\n- \\( h(2) = 10 \\) implies \\( f(10) = 2 \\) (since applying \\( f \\) to \\( h(2) = 10 \\) gives \\( f(10) = 2 \\)).\n- \\( h(10) = 1 \\) implies \\( f(1) = 10 \\) (for the same reason).\n- \\( h(1) = 2 \\) implies \\( f(2) = 1 \\).\n\n**Step 2: Compute \\( f(f(10)) \\).**\n- From \\( h(2) = 10 \\), we already know \\( f(10) = 2 \\).\n- Now apply \\( f \\) again: \\( f(f(10)) = f(2) \\).\n- From \\( h(1) = 2 \\), we know \\( f(2) = 1 \\).\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nSubstituting these results, \\( f(f(10)) = f(2) = 1 \\). Thus, \\( f(f(10)) = 1 \\), as required. The key idea is using the inverse relationship to \"reverse-engineer\" the values of \\( f \\) from the given \\( h \\)-values.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unsolved goals\n\u03c3 : \u211d \u2243 \u211d\nh\u2080 : \u03c3.symm 2 = 10\nh\u2081 : \u03c3.symm 10 = 1\nh\u2082 : \u03c3.symm 1 = 2\n\u22a2 1 = \u03c3.symm 10\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unsolved goals\n\u03c3 : \u211d \u2243 \u211d\nh\u2080 : \u03c3.symm 2 = 10\nh\u2081 : \u03c3.symm 10 = 1\nh\u2082 : \u03c3.symm 1 = 2\n\u22a2 \u03c3 (\u03c3 (\u03c3.symm (\u03c3.symm 1))) = \u03c3.symm 10\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unsolved goals\n\u03c3 : \u211d \u2243 \u211d\nh\u2080 : \u03c3.symm 2 = 10\nh\u2081 : \u03c3.symm 10 = 1\nh\u2082 : \u03c3.symm 1 = 2\n\u22a2 1 = \u03c3.symm 10\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the units digit n in the four-digit number 374n such that the number is divisible by 18. And we need to show that n is 4. Hmm, right.\n\nFirst, I remember that 18 is 2 times 9, so if a number is divisible by 18, it must be divisible by both 2 and 9. That makes sense because 2 and 9 are coprime. So the number has to satisfy two conditions: divisibility by 2 and divisibility by 9.\n\nStarting with divisibility by 2. The rule for that is the number's last digit has to be even. So n has to be 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8. That narrows down the possible values of n. But we need to check which of these also makes the number divisible by 9.\n\nNow, divisibility by 9 requires that the sum of the digits is a multiple of 9. Let's calculate the sum of the known digits. The number is 3, 7, 4, and n. So 3 + 7 + 4 + n. Let's add those up: 3 + 7 is 10, plus 4 is 14. So the total sum is 14 + n. This sum needs to be divisible by 9.\n\nSo 14 + n \u2261 0 mod 9. Let's solve for n. The smallest multiple of 9 greater than or equal to 14 is 18 (since 9*2=18). So 14 + n = 18 would mean n=4. The next multiple is 27, so 14 + n=27 would mean n=13, but n is a single digit, so that's not possible. So the only possible value here is n=4. But wait, we also need to check if 4 is even, which it is. So n=4 satisfies both conditions: it makes the number even (divisible by 2) and the sum of digits 18 (divisible by 9). Therefore, n must be 4.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. If n were 4, the number is 3744. Let's verify. 3744 divided by 18. Let's see: 18 times 200 is 3600. 3744 - 3600 = 144. 144 divided by 18 is 8. So 200 + 8 = 208. 18*208 = 3744. Yep, that works. So n=4 is correct. The other even digits would give sums that aren't multiples of 9. For example, n=0: sum 14+0=14, not divisible by 9. n=2: 16, not divisible. n=6: 20, no. n=8: 22, no. So only 4 works. That makes sense.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo determine the units digit \\( n \\) such that the four-digit number \\( 374n \\) is divisible by 18, we use the fact that divisibility by 18 requires the number to be divisible by both \\( 2 \\) and \\( 9 \\).\n\n1. **Divisibility by 2**:  \n   The units digit \\( n \\) must be even (\\( n = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 \\)).\n\n2. **Divisibility by 9**:  \n   The sum of all digits must be a multiple of 9. The known digits are \\( 3 + 7 + 4 = 14 \\). Adding \\( n \\), the total sum is \\( 14 + n \\).  \n   We need \\( 14 + n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{9} \\).  \n   Solving for \\( n \\):  \n   - The smallest multiple of 9 greater than 14 is \\( 18 \\), so \\( 14 + n = 18 \\implies n = 4 \\).  \n   - Larger multiples (e.g., \\( 27 \\)) would require \\( n = 13 \\), which is invalid since \\( n \\) must be a single digit.  \n\n3. **Verification**:  \n   - \\( n = 4 \\) is even, satisfying divisibility by 2.  \n   - The sum \\( 14 + 4 = 18 \\), which is divisible by 9.  \n   - The number \\( 3744 \\) is confirmed to be divisible by 18 (\\( 3744 \\div 18 = 208 \\)).  \n\nOther even digits (\\( 0, 2, 6, 8 \\)) fail the divisibility-by-9 test. Thus, the units digit \\( n \\) must be **4**.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  ?a % ?n % ?n\ncase H\nn : \u2115\nh\u2080 : n \u2264 9\nh\u2081 : 18 \u2223 374 * 10 + n\n\u22a2 (374 % 2 * (10 % 2) % 2 + n % 2) % 2 = 0\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  ?a % ?n % ?n\ncase H\nn : \u2115\nh\u2080 : n \u2264 9\nh\u2081 : 18 \u2223 374 * 10 + n\nh\u2082 : 2 \u2223 374 * 10 + n\n\u22a2 (374 % 9 * (10 % 9) % 9 + n % 9) % 9 = 0\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  ?a % ?n % ?n\ncase H\nn : \u2115\nh\u2080 : n \u2264 9\nh\u2081 : 18 \u2223 374 * 10 + n\nh\u2082 : 2 \u2223 374 * 10 + n\nh\u2083 : 9 \u2223 374 * 10 + n\n\u22a2 (374 % 18 * (10 % 18) % 18 + n % 18) % 18 = 0\napplication type mismatch\n  eq_of_mul_eq_mul_right ?m.769\nargument\n  ?m.769\nhas type\n  18 \u2260 0 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  0 < ?m.726 : Prop\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown constant 'Nat.Prime.dvd_of_dvd_mul_left'\nunknown constant 'Nat.Prime.dvd_of_dvd_mul_left'\ntype mismatch\n  this\nhas type\n  (3740 + n) % 2 = 0 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  n % 2 = 0 : Prop\ntype mismatch\n  this\nhas type\n  (3740 + n) % 9 = 0 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  (3 + 7 + 4 + n) % 9 = 0 : Prop\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  14 % succ 14\nn : \u2115\nh\u2080 : n \u2264 9\nh\u2081 : 18 \u2223 374 * 10 + n\nh\u2082 : 2 \u2223 374 * 10 + n\nh\u2083 : 9 \u2223 374 * 10 + n\nh\u2084 : n % 2 = 0\nh\u2085 : (3 + 7 + 4 + n) % 9 = 0\n\u22a2 14 + n \u2261 0 [MOD 9]\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  14 % succ 14\nn : \u2115\nh\u2080 : n \u2264 9\nh\u2081 : 18 \u2223 374 * 10 + n\nh\u2082 : 2 \u2223 374 * 10 + n\nh\u2083 : 9 \u2223 374 * 10 + n\nh\u2084 : n % 2 = 0\nh\u2085 : (3 + 7 + 4 + n) % 9 = 0\nthis : 14 + n \u2261 0 [MOD 9]\n\u22a2 14 \u2261 5 [MOD 9]\napplication type mismatch\n  ModEq.add_right_cancel' 5 this\nargument\n  this\nhas type\n  14 \u2261 5 [MOD 9] : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  n + 5 \u2261 4 + 5 [MOD 9] : Prop\nunknown constant 'Nat.ModEq.eq'\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  ?a % ?n % ?n\ncase H\nn : \u2115\nh\u2080 : n \u2264 9\nh\u2081 : 18 \u2223 374 * 10 + n\n\u22a2 (374 % 2 * (10 % 2) % 2 + n % 2) % 2 = 0\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  ?a % ?n % ?n\ncase H\nn : \u2115\nh\u2080 : n \u2264 9\nh\u2081 : 18 \u2223 374 * 10 + n\nh\u2082 : 2 \u2223 374 * 10 + n\n\u22a2 (374 % 9 * (10 % 9) % 9 + n % 9) % 9 = 0\ntype mismatch\n  h\u2082\nhas type\n  2 \u2223 374 * 10 + n : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  2 \u2223 n : Prop\ntype mismatch\n  h\u2083\nhas type\n  9 \u2223 374 * 10 + n : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  9 \u2223 3 + 7 + 4 + n : Prop\nno goals to be solved\ntype mismatch\n  h\u2086\nhas type\n  14 + n \u2261 0 [MOD 9] : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  n + 5 \u2261 4 + 5 [MOD 9] : Prop\nThe rfl tactic failed.

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to prove that the expression a\u00b2b(a - b) + b\u00b2c(b - c) + c\u00b2a(c - a) is greater than or equal to zero for any triangle with side lengths a, b, c. And also determine when equality holds. Hmm. Wait, but the problem statement says \"Let a, b, c be the lengths of the sides of a triangle.\" So first, I need to check if there are any specific conditions on the triangle. The context given mentions something about inscribed squares in a right-angled triangle, but the problem here is general for any triangle. Maybe the context is a red herring, or maybe there's a connection. Let me think.\n\nWait, the problem is about a general triangle, not necessarily right-angled. So maybe the context about inscribed squares isn't directly relevant here. Maybe the user included that context by mistake. But perhaps there's a technique used in that context that can be applied here. Let me check the context again. The context mentions a theorem about inscribed squares in a right-angled triangle with side lengths a, b, c, where c is the hypotenuse, and gives formulas for the side lengths l of inscribed squares. But the problem here is different. So maybe the connection is tenuous. Maybe I should proceed without relying on that context.\n\nSo, back to the problem. The expression is a cyclic sum: a\u00b2b(a - b) + b\u00b2c(b - c) + c\u00b2a(c - a). I need to show this is non-negative. Let's first try to understand the structure of this expression. Each term is of the form x\u00b2y(x - y), where x and y are sides of the triangle. So each term is x\u00b2y(x - y). Let's expand each term to see if there's a pattern.\n\nFirst term: a\u00b2b(a - b) = a\u00b3b - a\u00b2b\u00b2\n\nSecond term: b\u00b2c(b - c) = b\u00b3c - b\u00b2c\u00b2\n\nThird term: c\u00b2a(c - a) = c\u00b3a - c\u00b2a\u00b2\n\nSo the entire expression becomes:\n\na\u00b3b - a\u00b2b\u00b2 + b\u00b3c - b\u00b2c\u00b2 + c\u00b3a - c\u00b2a\u00b2\n\nHmm. Let's rearrange the terms:\n\n= a\u00b3b - a\u00b2b\u00b2 + b\u00b3c - b\u00b2c\u00b2 + c\u00b3a - c\u00b2a\u00b2\n\nMaybe group similar terms:\n\n= a\u00b2b(a - b) + b\u00b2c(b - c) + c\u00b2a(c - a)\n\nWait, that's the original expression. Alternatively, maybe factor terms differently. Let's see if we can factor this expression or find a way to write it as a sum of squares or something non-negative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider symmetry or substitution. Let's consider if the triangle is equilateral. If a = b = c, then each term becomes a\u00b2a(a - a) = 0, so the entire expression is zero. So equality occurs when a = b = c. That's a possible case. But the problem says \"determine when equality occurs,\" so maybe the equality is only when the triangle is equilateral? Or are there other cases?\n\nWait, but in a general triangle, sides can be unequal. Let's test some specific cases. For example, take a triangle with sides a = 2, b = 1, c = 2 (but wait, in a triangle, the sum of any two sides must exceed the third. So 2, 1, 2: 1 + 2 > 2, yes. So that's a valid triangle. Let's compute the expression:\n\na\u00b2b(a - b) = 4*1*(2 -1) = 4*1*1 = 4\n\nb\u00b2c(b - c) = 1\u00b2*2*(1 -2) = 1*2*(-1) = -2\n\nc\u00b2a(c - a) = 4*2*(2 -2) = 8*0 = 0\n\nTotal expression: 4 -2 +0 = 2 \u22650. So it's positive here. Another case: a=3, b=2, c=4. Check triangle inequality: 3+2>4, 2+4>3, 3+4>2. Okay.\n\nCompute each term:\n\na\u00b2b(a - b) = 9*2*(3-2)=18*1=18\n\nb\u00b2c(b - c)=4*4*(2-4)=16*(-2)=-32\n\nc\u00b2a(c - a)=16*3*(4-3)=48*1=48\n\nTotal: 18 -32 +48 = 34 \u22650. Positive again.\n\nAnother case: a=1, b=2, c=2. Valid triangle.\n\na\u00b2b(a - b)=1*2*(1-2)=2*(-1)=-2\n\nb\u00b2c(b - c)=4*2*(2-2)=0\n\nc\u00b2a(c - a)=4*1*(2-1)=4*1=4\n\nTotal: -2 +0 +4=2 \u22650. Positive.\n\nAnother case: a=5, b=3, c=7. Check triangle: 5+3>7? 8>7 yes.\n\nCompute:\n\na\u00b2b(a - b)=25*3*(5-3)=75*2=150\n\nb\u00b2c(b - c)=9*7*(3-7)=63*(-4)=-252\n\nc\u00b2a(c - a)=49*5*(7-5)=245*2=490\n\nTotal: 150 -252 +490 = 388 \u22650. Positive.\n\nHmm, seems like in these examples, the expression is positive. So maybe the inequality holds. But how to prove it in general?\n\nLet me think about possible approaches. Maybe factor the expression. Let's write the expression again:\n\nE = a\u00b2b(a - b) + b\u00b2c(b - c) + c\u00b2a(c - a)\n\nAlternatively, expand each term:\n\nE = a\u00b3b - a\u00b2b\u00b2 + b\u00b3c - b\u00b2c\u00b2 + c\u00b3a - c\u00b2a\u00b2\n\nNow, group terms:\n\n= a\u00b3b - a\u00b2b\u00b2 + b\u00b3c - b\u00b2c\u00b2 + c\u00b3a - c\u00b2a\u00b2\n\n= a\u00b2b(a - b) + b\u00b2c(b - c) + c\u00b2a(c - a)\n\nAlternatively, factor terms:\n\nLooking for common factors. Maybe factor a\u00b2b from the first term, but not sure. Alternatively, rearrange terms:\n\nLet me write all terms:\n\na\u00b3b - a\u00b2b\u00b2 + b\u00b3c - b\u00b2c\u00b2 + c\u00b3a - c\u00b2a\u00b2\n\nLet me group terms with similar variables:\n\na\u00b3b - a\u00b2b\u00b2 = a\u00b2b(a - b)\n\nSimilarly, b\u00b3c - b\u00b2c\u00b2 = b\u00b2c(b - c)\n\nAnd c\u00b3a - c\u00b2a\u00b2 = c\u00b2a(c - a)\n\nBut that's how we started. Alternatively, perhaps factor each pair:\n\na\u00b2b(a - b) + b\u00b2c(b - c) + c\u00b2a(c - a)\n\nHmm. Maybe factor out ab from the first term, bc from the second, and ca from the third:\n\nab * a(a - b) + bc * b(b - c) + ca * c(c - a)\n\nBut that gives ab(a\u00b2 - ab) + bc(b\u00b2 - bc) + ca(c\u00b2 - ca)\n\nNot sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps consider cyclic symmetry. The expression is cyclic in a, b, c. Maybe assume an ordering of the variables, like a \u2265 b \u2265 c, and see if that helps. But since the expression is cyclic, not symmetric, the ordering might not hold for all terms.\n\nAlternatively, consider substituting variables. Let me think of substituting variables such as x = a - b, y = b - c, z = c - a, but that might complicate things.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps rewrite the expression as a sum of terms that are squares or products that can be bounded.\n\nAlternatively, consider homogenizing the inequality. Since the inequality is homogeneous (all terms are degree 4), we can assume some normalization, like setting a + b + c = 1, but not sure if that helps.\n\nWait, maybe consider the expression as a combination of differences. Let's see:\n\nE = a\u00b2b(a - b) + b\u00b2c(b - c) + c\u00b2a(c - a)\n\nLet me factor each term as ab(a\u00b2 - ab) + bc(b\u00b2 - bc) + ca(c\u00b2 - ca)\n\nBut a\u00b2 - ab = a(a - b), which is the same as before. Alternatively, note that a\u00b2b(a - b) = a^3 b - a^2 b^2, and similarly for others. So E = a^3 b - a^2 b^2 + b^3 c - b^2 c^2 + c^3 a - c^2 a^2\n\nNow, let's see if we can rearrange terms to form squares or positive terms. For example, maybe group a^3 b and c^3 a:\n\na^3 b + c^3 a = a(b a^2 + c^3)\n\nNot sure. Alternatively, factor a^2 b from the first two terms:\n\nWait, no. Let's try to factor terms differently. Let's consider:\n\nE = a^3 b - a^2 b^2 + b^3 c - b^2 c^2 + c^3 a - c^2 a^2\n\nLet me group terms as follows:\n\n= a^3 b - c^2 a^2 + b^3 c - a^2 b^2 + c^3 a - b^2 c^2\n\nHmm, not helpful. Alternatively, factor a^2 from the first and fourth terms:\n\na^2 (a b - b^2) + b^2 (b c - c^2) + c^2 (c a - a^2)\n\nBut that's back to the original expression.\n\nWait, maybe factor each term as a product involving (a - b), (b - c), etc. For example:\n\na\u00b2b(a - b) = a b a (a - b) = a^2 b (a - b)\n\nBut perhaps consider that (a - b) is part of the term. If we can relate these terms to each other.\n\nAlternatively, consider the entire expression as a cyclic sum. Let's denote the cyclic sum over a, b, c. So E = \u03a3_{cyc} a\u00b2b(a - b)\n\nMaybe rewrite this as \u03a3 a^3 b - \u03a3 a^2 b^2\n\nSo E = (a^3 b + b^3 c + c^3 a) - (a^2 b^2 + b^2 c^2 + c^2 a^2)\n\nSo E = (sum of a^3 b) - (sum of a^2 b^2)\n\nNow, perhaps compare these two sums. Maybe use the rearrangement inequality. The rearrangement inequality states that for two sequences sorted in the same order, the sum of their products is maximized. But I'm not sure if that applies here.\n\nAlternatively, consider that a^3 b + b^3 c + c^3 a \u2265 a^2 b^2 + b^2 c^2 + c^2 a^2\n\nBut how to show this? Maybe factor the difference:\n\nE = a^3 b - a^2 b^2 + b^3 c - b^2 c^2 + c^3 a - c^2 a^2\n\n= a^2 b (a - b) + b^2 c (b - c) + c^2 a (c - a)\n\nAlternatively, factor each term as a^2 b (a - b) = a^2 b a - a^2 b^2 = a^3 b - a^2 b^2\n\nBut perhaps consider adding and subtracting terms to complete squares or find non-negative expressions.\n\nWait, another idea: use the fact that in any triangle, the sides satisfy the triangle inequalities. But how does that help here? The expression is homogeneous of degree 4, so maybe we can normalize by setting one side to 1, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, consider substituting variables. Let me set x = a/b, y = b/c, z = c/a. But since this is cyclic, maybe that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, use the AM-GM inequality. But the terms have mixed signs. For example, if a > b, then a - b is positive, so a\u00b2b(a - b) is positive. If a < b, then that term is negative. Similarly for the other terms. So the expression is a combination of positive and negative terms. How to show that their sum is non-negative?\n\nAlternatively, consider the entire expression as a sum over cyclic permutations and try to find a way to express it as a product or sum of squares.\n\nWait, let's try to factor E. Suppose we can factor E as (a - b)(b - c)(c - a)(something). But let's check. If a = b, then E becomes 0 + b\u00b2c(b - c) + c\u00b2b(c - b) = b\u00b2c(b - c) + c\u00b2b(c - b) = b\u00b2c(b - c) - c\u00b2b(b - c) = bc(b - c)(b - c) = bc(b - c)^2. Wait, if a = b, then E = bc(b - c)^2. Which is non-negative. Similarly, if b = c, then E = a\u00b2b(a - b) + 0 + c\u00b2a(c - a) = a\u00b2b(a - b) + a c\u00b2(c - a). If b = c, then since it's a triangle, but maybe this is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, consider that when two variables are equal, say a = b, then E = 0 + b\u00b2c(b - c) + c\u00b2b(c - b) = b\u00b2c(b - c) - c\u00b2b(b - c) = bc(b - c)(b - c) = bc(b - c)^2 \u22650. So equality holds when a = b = c, but also when two variables are equal and the third is equal as well. Wait, but if a = b, then E = bc(b - c)^2. So equality occurs when either b = c or bc=0. But bc can't be zero since they are sides of a triangle. So equality when a = b and b = c, i.e., all equal. Or when two variables are equal and the third equals them. So equality only when a = b = c. Wait, but if a = b \u2260 c, then E = bc(b - c)^2, which is positive unless b = c. So equality only when a = b = c. So maybe the equality case is only the equilateral triangle.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine when equality occurs,\" so perhaps the answer is that equality holds if and only if the triangle is equilateral.\n\nBut how to prove that E \u22650 for any triangle, with equality iff a = b = c.\n\nLet me think of another approach. Maybe use the fact that in any triangle, the sides can be expressed in terms of angles, but that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, consider using the Ravi substitution, where we let a = x + y, b = y + z, c = z + x for positive x, y, z. This is a common substitution for triangle sides. Let's try that.\n\nSet a = x + y, b = y + z, c = z + x, where x, y, z > 0.\n\nNow substitute into E:\n\nE = a\u00b2b(a - b) + b\u00b2c(b - c) + c\u00b2a(c - a)\n\nLet's compute each term:\n\nFirst term: a\u00b2b(a - b) = (x + y)^2 (y + z) [(x + y) - (y + z)] = (x + y)^2 (y + z)(x - z)\n\nSecond term: b\u00b2c(b - c) = (y + z)^2 (z + x) [(y + z) - (z + x)] = (y + z)^2 (z + x)(y - x)\n\nThird term: c\u00b2a(c - a) = (z + x)^2 (x + y) [(z + x) - (x + y)] = (z + x)^2 (x + y)(z - y)\n\nSo E = (x + y)^2 (y + z)(x - z) + (y + z)^2 (z + x)(y - x) + (z + x)^2 (x + y)(z - y)\n\nThis seems complicated, but maybe there's cancellation. Let's expand each term:\n\nFirst term: (x + y)^2 (y + z)(x - z)\n\nSecond term: (y + z)^2 (z + x)(y - x)\n\nThird term: (z + x)^2 (x + y)(z - y)\n\nNotice that each term has a factor of (x + y)(y + z)(z + x). Let's factor that out:\n\nE = (x + y)(y + z)(z + x) [ (x + y)(x - z) + (y + z)(y - x) + (z + x)(z - y) ]\n\nLet me compute the expression inside the brackets:\n\nLet\u2019s denote S = (x + y)(x - z) + (y + z)(y - x) + (z + x)(z - y)\n\nExpand each term:\n\nFirst term: (x + y)(x - z) = x(x - z) + y(x - z) = x\u00b2 - x z + x y - y z\n\nSecond term: (y + z)(y - x) = y(y - x) + z(y - x) = y\u00b2 - x y + y z - x z\n\nThird term: (z + x)(z - y) = z(z - y) + x(z - y) = z\u00b2 - y z + x z - x y\n\nNow sum all three terms:\n\nFirst term: x\u00b2 - x z + x y - y z\n\nSecond term: y\u00b2 - x y + y z - x z\n\nThird term: z\u00b2 - y z + x z - x y\n\nAdd them together:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 - x z + x y - y z - x y + y z - x z + x z - x y - y z + x z\n\nWait, let's do this step by step:\n\nFrom first term: x\u00b2 - x z + x y - y z\n\nFrom second term: + y\u00b2 - x y + y z - x z\n\nFrom third term: + z\u00b2 - y z + x z - x y\n\nNow combine like terms:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2\n\nFor the x z terms:\n\n- x z (from first term) - x z (from second term) + x z (from third term)",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is to find the modulo 6 remainder of the sum from 1 to 100. The answer should be 4. Hmm, how do I approach this?\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with modulo operations, sometimes it's easier to compute each term modulo 6 first and then sum them up, instead of summing all numbers and then taking modulo 6. Because modulo distributes over addition, right? So (a + b) mod 6 is the same as (a mod 6 + b mod 6) mod 6. That might simplify things.\n\nSo, maybe I can compute each number from 1 to 100 modulo 6, add those remainders together, and then take modulo 6 of the total sum. That should give the same result as summing all numbers first and then taking modulo 6. Let me check that logic. If I have numbers a and b, then (a + b) mod 6 = [(a mod 6) + (b mod 6)] mod 6. Yes, that's correct. So applying this to all terms from 1 to 100, the final remainder would be the sum of each term's remainder mod 6.\n\nNow, let's think about the numbers from 1 to 100. Each number when divided by 6 will have a remainder of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. So, every 6 numbers form a cycle. For example, 1 mod 6 is 1, 2 mod 6 is 2, ..., 6 mod 6 is 0, then 7 mod 6 is 1 again, and so on. So the remainders repeat every 6 numbers. That means the pattern of remainders is periodic with period 6.\n\nIf I can figure out how many complete cycles of 6 there are in 100 numbers, and then handle the remaining numbers, that could work. Let's see: 100 divided by 6 is 16 with a remainder of 4. So there are 16 full cycles (each of 6 numbers) and then 4 remaining numbers (97, 98, 99, 100). Wait, no. Wait, 16 cycles would be 16*6=96 numbers, so the remaining numbers are 97 to 100, which are 4 numbers. So each full cycle contributes the same sum of remainders.\n\nWhat's the sum of remainders in one cycle? Let's take numbers 1 to 6. Their remainders mod 6 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 0. The sum is 1+2+3+4+5+0 = 15. So each full cycle of 6 numbers contributes 15 to the total sum of remainders. Then, for 16 cycles, that's 16*15 = 240. Then, the remaining 4 numbers (97, 98, 99, 100) need to be considered. Let's find their remainders mod 6.\n\nBut wait, 97 is 96 +1, and 96 is divisible by 6 (since 16*6=96). So 97 mod 6 is 1, 98 mod 6 is 2, 99 mod 6 is 3, 100 mod 6 is 4. So their remainders are 1, 2, 3, 4. Summing those gives 1+2+3+4=10. So total sum of remainders is 240 +10=250. Then, take 250 mod 6. What's 250 divided by 6? 6*41=246, remainder 4. So 250 mod 6 is 4. Therefore, the remainder is 4. That matches the answer we need to show.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way. The sum from 1 to n is n(n+1)/2. So for n=100, the sum is 100*101/2 = 5050. Then compute 5050 mod 6. Let's see. But calculating 5050 mod 6 directly might be tedious, but maybe we can break it down. Let's see: 5050 divided by 6. 6*841=5046, so 5050 -5046=4. So 5050 mod 6 is 4. That's another way to get the same result. So both methods lead to the same answer.\n\nBut the problem says to show that it's 4, so either approach works. However, the first method using the sum of remainders might be more illustrative of the modulo operation's properties. Let me check if both methods are equivalent. In the first approach, we're summing the remainders and then taking mod 6. In the second approach, we sum all numbers and then take mod 6. Since modulo is distributive over addition, both should give the same result. So either way, the answer is 4.\n\nWait, but let me verify the second method again. Sum from 1 to 100 is 5050. 5050 divided by 6: 6*841=5046, 5050-5046=4. So yes, remainder 4. So both methods confirm the answer is 4. Therefore, the proof can be presented either way, but perhaps using the formula for the sum is more straightforward. However, the problem might expect using the properties of modulo, breaking down the sum into cycles.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern in the sum's modulo. Let's see, the sum S = n(n+1)/2. So for n=100, S=100*101/2=5050. Then 5050 mod 6. Let's compute 5050 divided by 6. 6*841=5046, remainder 4. So 5050 mod 6=4. That's straightforward. But perhaps the problem expects a more detailed breakdown, especially if the student isn't allowed to use the formula.\n\nAlternatively, if we don't use the formula, we can compute the sum modulo 6 directly. Let's see. The sum S = 1+2+3+...+100. To compute S mod 6, we can compute each term mod 6, sum them, and then mod 6 again. As I did earlier, grouping into cycles of 6. Each cycle sum is 15, which mod 6 is 15 mod 6=3. So 16 cycles contribute 16*3=48 mod 6. Wait, no. Wait, each cycle's sum is 15, so 16 cycles sum to 16*15=240. Then 240 mod 6 is 0, because 240 is divisible by 6. Then the remaining 4 terms sum to 10, which mod 6 is 4. So total sum mod 6 is 0 +4=4. That's another way to see it.\n\nAlternatively, since each cycle of 6 numbers contributes a sum that's 15, which is 3 mod 6 (since 15/6=2*6=12, remainder 3). So each cycle contributes 3 mod 6. Then 16 cycles contribute 16*3=48 mod 6. 48 mod 6 is 0. Then the remaining 4 terms sum to 10, which is 4 mod 6. So total is 0+4=4. That's another approach. So this method breaks down the sum into cycles and their contributions modulo 6.\n\nEither way, the conclusion is the same. The key steps are recognizing the periodicity of remainders modulo 6, calculating the contribution of each cycle, handling the remaining terms, and summing everything modulo 6. Both approaches confirm that the remainder is 4.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo find the remainder when the sum \\(1 + 2 + 3 + \\dots + 100\\) is divided by \\(6\\), we can exploit the periodic nature of remainders modulo \\(6\\). Here's how:\n\n1. **Key Insight**:  \n   Every sequence of \\(6\\) consecutive integers forms a \"cycle\" of remainders modulo \\(6\\):  \n   \\(1 \\bmod 6 = 1\\), \\(2 \\bmod 6 = 2\\), \\(3 \\bmod 6 = 3\\), \\(4 \\bmod 6 = 4\\), \\(5 \\bmod 6 = 5\\), \\(6 \\bmod 6 = 0\\).  \n   The sum of these remainders in one cycle is \\(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 0 = 15\\).\n\n2. **Number of Full Cycles**:  \n   Since \\(100 \\div 6 = 16\\) with a remainder of \\(4\\), there are \\(16\\) complete cycles (covering \\(96\\) numbers) and \\(4\\) remaining terms (\\(97, 98, 99, 100\\)).\n\n3. **Sum of Full Cycles**:  \n   Each cycle contributes \\(15\\) to the total sum. For \\(16\\) cycles:  \n   \\[\n   16 \\times 15 = 240.\n   \\]  \n   Taking \\(240 \\bmod 6\\) gives \\(0\\) (since \\(240\\) is divisible by \\(6\\)).\n\n4. **Sum of Remaining Terms**:  \n   The remaining numbers \\(97, 98, 99, 100\\) correspond to the same remainders as \\(1, 2, 3, 4\\) modulo \\(6\\) (because \\(97 = 6 \\times 16 + 1\\), etc.). Their sum is:  \n   \\[\n   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.\n   \\]  \n   Taking \\(10 \\bmod 6\\) gives \\(4\\).\n\n5. **Final Result**:  \n   Adding the contributions from the cycles and the remaining terms:  \n   \\[\n   (0 + 4) \\bmod 6 = 4.\n   \\]  \n\nThus, the remainder when \\(1 + 2 + 3 + \\dots + 100\\) is divided by \\(6\\) is **4**.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is to find the value of z/x given the equations 2x = 5y and 7y = 10z, and show that it's 7/25. Hmm. Alright, so I need to relate z to x through these two equations. Let me start by looking at the first equation: 2x = 5y. Maybe I can solve for y in terms of x here. If I divide both sides by 5, I get y = (2/5)x. That seems right.\n\nNow, the second equation is 7y = 10z. Since I already have y expressed in terms of x from the first equation, maybe I can substitute that into the second equation. So replacing y with (2/5)x gives me 7*(2/5)x = 10z. Let me compute that left side: 7 times 2 is 14, divided by 5, so 14/5 x. So the equation becomes (14/5)x = 10z.\n\nNow, I need to solve for z/x. Let me rearrange this equation. If I divide both sides by 10, I get z = (14/5)x / 10. Simplifying that, 14 divided by 5 times 10 is 14/(5*10) = 14/50. So z = (14/50)x. Then, z/x would be 14/50. Wait, but 14/50 simplifies to 7/25 when divided by 2. So that's the fraction. Let me check again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting over: 2x =5y \u2192 y = (2x)/5. Then 7y =10z. Substitute y: 7*(2x/5) =10z \u2192 14x/5 =10z \u2192 z= (14x)/(5*10) =14x/50 =7x/25. Therefore, z/x =7/25. Yep, that checks out. So the answer is 7/25. I think that's correct. The key steps were expressing y in terms of x from the first equation, substituting into the second to relate z and x, then solving for the ratio z/x. All the algebra steps seem to simplify correctly, and the reduction of 14/50 to 7/25 is valid. No steps seem missing. So the proof should be straightforward.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo find the value of \\(\\frac{z}{x}\\) given the equations \\(2x = 5y\\) and \\(7y = 10z\\), we start by expressing \\(y\\) in terms of \\(x\\) from the first equation.

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this equation: 2 + 1 divided by (1 + 1 divided by (2 + 2 divided by (3 + x))) equals 144/53. And the answer is supposed to be 3/4, option A. Hmm. Alright, let's break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, the equation is a bit complex with multiple nested fractions. Maybe I should start from the inside and work my way out. Let me rewrite the equation to make it clearer:\n\n2 + [1 / (1 + [1 / (2 + [2 / (3 + x)])])] = 144/53.\n\nLet me denote the innermost part first. Let's let y = 3 + x. Then the next part is 2 divided by y, so 2/y. Then add that to 2: 2 + (2/y). Let's call that part z. So z = 2 + (2/y). Then the next layer is 1 divided by z: 1/z. Then add that to 1: 1 + (1/z). Let's call that part w. So w = 1 + (1/z). Then take 1 divided by w: 1/w. Finally, add that to 2: 2 + (1/w) = 144/53.\n\nThis seems like a lot of layers. Maybe working backwards would be easier. Let me start from the left side and solve step by step.\n\nLet me set the entire expression equal to 144/53. Let's subtract 2 from both sides to isolate the fraction part. So:\n\n1 / (1 + 1 / (2 + 2 / (3 + x))) = 144/53 - 2.\n\nCalculating the right side: 144/53 - 2. Since 2 is 106/53, subtracting gives (144 - 106)/53 = 38/53. So now we have:\n\n1 / (1 + 1 / (2 + 2 / (3 + x))) = 38/53.\n\nTaking reciprocals on both sides:\n\n1 + 1 / (2 + 2 / (3 + x)) = 53/38.\n\nSubtract 1 from both sides:\n\n1 / (2 + 2 / (3 + x)) = 53/38 - 1.\n\nCalculating the right side: 53/38 - 38/38 = 15/38. So:\n\n1 / (2 + 2 / (3 + x)) = 15/38.\n\nTaking reciprocals again:\n\n2 + 2 / (3 + x) = 38/15.\n\nSubtract 2 from both sides:\n\n2 / (3 + x) = 38/15 - 2.\n\nConvert 2 to 30/15 to subtract: 38/15 - 30/15 = 8/15. So:\n\n2 / (3 + x) = 8/15.\n\nNow, solve for (3 + x). Multiply both sides by (3 + x):\n\n2 = (8/15)(3 + x).\n\nMultiply both sides by 15 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n30 = 8(3 + x).\n\nDivide both sides by 8:\n\n30/8 = 3 + x.\n\nSimplify 30/8 to 15/4:\n\n15/4 = 3 + x.\n\nSubtract 3 from both sides:\n\nx = 15/4 - 3.\n\nConvert 3 to 12/4:\n\nx = 15/4 - 12/4 = 3/4.\n\nSo x is 3/4, which is option A. Let me check each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the original equation, subtract 2, reciprocate, subtract 1, reciprocate again, subtract 2, solve for x. All steps seem to follow correctly. The arithmetic checks out. Yeah, that seems right.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nLet's solve the equation step by step by working from the outermost layer inward.

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the ones digit of the product 1 times 3 times 5 times 7 times 9 times 11 times 13. And show that it's 5. Hmm. Let's see. The ones digit of a number is the same as the remainder when you divide by 10, right? Because the last digit is determined by modulo 10. So maybe I can compute the entire product modulo 10 and see what the result is. If the result is congruent to 5 mod 10, then the ones digit is 5.\n\nBut multiplying all those numbers together directly might be tedious. Let me list them out: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13. Wait, some of these numbers are even, but looking at them, no, actually all the numbers here are odd. Wait, 5 is there, and 5 multiplied by any odd number will end with 5. Wait, let's think. For example, 5 times 1 is 5, 5 times 3 is 15, which ends with 5. 15 times 5 is 75, ends with 5. So maybe once you have a 5 in the product and another odd number, the product will end with 5. Because 5 times any odd number is going to end with 5. Let me check that.\n\nTake 5 times 7: 35, ends with 5. 35 times 9: 315, ends with 5. 315 times 11: 3465, ends with 5. 3465 times 13: 45045, ends with 5. Oh, so each time you multiply by an odd number, the last digit remains 5. So if there's a 5 in the factors and all other factors are odd, then the product will end with 5. Because 5 times 1 is 5, 5 times 3 is 15 (ends with 5), 15 times 5 is 75 (ends with 5), and so on. Each multiplication by an odd number preserves the last digit as 5. So in this case, since the product includes 5 and all other factors are odd, the ones digit must be 5.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure there's no even numbers here. The factors are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13. All odd. So multiplying them all together, the product is odd. And since there's a 5 in there, the product will be a multiple of 5, so the ones digit is either 5 or 0. But since all factors are odd, the product can't be even, so the ones digit can't be 0. Therefore, it must be 5. That makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the product modulo 10 step by step. Let's try that. Starting with 1:\n\n1 * 3 = 3 \u2192 3 mod 10 is 3.\n\n3 * 5 = 15 \u2192 15 mod 10 is 5.\n\n5 * 7 = 35 \u2192 35 mod 10 is 5.\n\n5 * 9 = 45 \u2192 45 mod 10 is 5.\n\n5 * 11 = 55 \u2192 55 mod 10 is 5.\n\n5 * 13 = 65 \u2192 65 mod 10 is 5.\n\nSo after each multiplication, the result modulo 10 is 5. Therefore, the final product modulo 10 is 5, so the ones digit is 5. That confirms it.\n\nAnother way to think about it: when you multiply numbers together, the ones digit depends only on the ones digits of the factors. So maybe I can look at the ones digits of each number in the product. Let's see:\n\n1 (ones digit 1), 3 (3), 5 (5), 7 (7), 9 (9), 11 (1), 13 (3). So the ones digits are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 1, 3. Now, multiply these ones digits together modulo 10.\n\n1 * 3 = 3 \u2192 3 mod 10.\n\n3 * 5 = 15 \u2192 5 mod 10.\n\n5 * 7 = 35 \u2192 5 mod 10.\n\n5 * 9 = 45 \u2192 5 mod 10.\n\n5 * 1 = 5 \u2192 5 mod 10.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5 mod 10.\n\nSo again, the result is 5. Therefore, the ones digit is 5.\n\nSo all these methods point to the ones digit being 5. The key points are that there's a factor of 5 and all other factors are odd, so the product is a multiple of 5 but not a multiple of 10, hence the ones digit must be 5.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo determine the ones digit of the product \\(1 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13\\), we focus on the remainder when this product is divided by 10. The ones digit of any number is equivalent to its value modulo 10. Here\u2019s the reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of 5 and Odd Factors**:  \n   The product includes the factor \\(5\\), and all other factors (\\(1, 3, 7, 9, 11, 13\\)) are odd. When \\(5\\) is multiplied by any odd number, the result ends with \\(5\\). For example:\n   - \\(5 \\times 1 = 5\\),\n   - \\(5 \\times 3 = 15\\),\n   - \\(15 \\times 7 = 105\\),\n   - and so on.  \n   Each subsequent multiplication by an odd number preserves the ones digit as \\(5\\).\n\n2. **Modulo 10 Simplification**:  \n   Compute the product step-by-step modulo 10:\n   - \\(1 \\cdot 3 = 3 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{10}\\),\n   - \\(3 \\cdot 5 = 15 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{10}\\),\n   - \\(5 \\cdot 7 = 35 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{10}\\),\n   - \\(5 \\cdot 9 = 45 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{10}\\),\n   - \\(5 \\cdot 11 = 55 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{10}\\),\n   - \\(5 \\cdot 13 = 65 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{10}\\).  \n   At every step, the result modulo 10 remains \\(5\\).\n\n3. **Eliminating Ambiguity**:  \n   A number ending in \\(0\\) is divisible by \\(10\\), but since all factors are odd, the product cannot be even (no factor of \\(2\\)), so the ones digit cannot be \\(0\\). Thus, the only possible ones digit is \\(5\\).\n\n**Conclusion**: The ones digit of \\(1 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13\\) is **5**.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to evaluate this expression: (100\u00b2 - 7\u00b2)/(70\u00b2 - 11\u00b2) multiplied by [(70 - 11)(70 + 11)] / [(100 - 7)(100 + 7)]. And show that it's equal to 1. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember that expressions like a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 can be factored into (a - b)(a + b). That's the difference of squares formula. So maybe I can apply that here to simplify the fractions.\n\nLooking at the first part of the expression: (100\u00b2 - 7\u00b2)/(70\u00b2 - 11\u00b2). Let's factor both numerator and denominator. The numerator becomes (100 - 7)(100 + 7), and the denominator becomes (70 - 11)(70 + 11). So that part would be [(100 - 7)(100 + 7)] / [(70 - 11)(70 + 11)].\n\nWait, but then the second part of the original expression is [(70 - 11)(70 + 11)] / [(100 - 7)(100 + 7)]. So if I write both parts out, the first fraction is [(100-7)(100+7)]/[(70-11)(70+11)] and the second fraction is [(70-11)(70+11)]/[(100-7)(100+7)]. \n\nOh, I see! When you multiply these two fractions together, the terms (70 - 11)(70 + 11) in the denominator of the first fraction and the numerator of the second fraction will cancel each other out. Similarly, the (100 - 7)(100 + 7) in the numerator of the first fraction and the denominator of the second fraction will also cancel. So everything cancels, leaving just 1. \n\nLet me check that again. The first fraction is (difference of squares)/(difference of squares) which factors into (a-b)(a+b)/(c-d)(c+d). Then the second fraction is (c-d)(c+d)/(a-b)(a+b). Multiplying them together, the (a-b)(a+b) cancels with the denominator of the second fraction, and the (c-d)(c+d) cancels with the numerator of the second fraction. So yes, all terms cancel, resulting in 1. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 1. \n\nI think that's the key insight here. The problem is structured in a way that each factor in the numerator of one fraction cancels with the denominator of the other. So the answer is 1, which is option A.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nLet's analyze the given expression step by step. The expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{100^2 - 7^2}{70^2 - 11^2} \\cdot \\frac{(70 - 11)(70 + 11)}{(100 - 7)(100 + 7)}.\n\\]\n\nFirst, recall the **difference of squares** formula: \\(a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)\\). Apply this to both the numerator and denominator of the first fraction:\n\n1. \\(100^2 - 7^2 = (100 - 7)(100 + 7)\\),\n2. \\(70^2 - 11^2 = (70 - 11)(70 + 11)\\).\n\nSubstituting these into the original expression, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(100 - 7)(100 + 7)}{(70 - 11)(70 + 11)} \\cdot \\frac{(70 - 11)(70 + 11)}{(100 - 7)(100 + 7)}.\n\\]\n\nNow observe that the terms \\((70 - 11)(70 + 11)\\) appear in the **denominator** of the first fraction and the **numerator** of the second fraction. Similarly, \\((100 - 7)(100 + 7)\\) appears in the **numerator** of the first fraction and the **denominator** of the second fraction. \n\nWhen multiplying the two fractions, these identical terms **cancel out**:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\cancel{(100 - 7)(100 + 7)}}{\\cancel{(70 - 11)(70 + 11)}} \\cdot \\frac{\\cancel{(70 - 11)(70 + 11)}}{\\cancel{(100 - 7)(100 + 7)}} = 1.\n\\]\n\nThus, the entire expression simplifies to **1**.

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to prove that if a and b are real numbers with a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 1, then ab + |a - b| \u2264 1. Hmm. Alright, first, let's understand what's given and what's to prove. The condition a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 1 means that the point (a, b) lies on the unit circle. So maybe there's a geometric interpretation here, but I'll try to approach it algebraically first.\n\nThe expression to maximize is ab + |a - b|. Since we have a constraint a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 1, perhaps using substitution or inequalities like Cauchy-Schwarz might help. Wait, in the context provided, there's a proof of the triangle inequality for complex numbers using Cauchy's inequality. Maybe similar techniques apply here.\n\nLet me start by considering the absolute value term |a - b|. Absolute values can complicate things, so maybe squaring both sides could help, but I have to be careful because squaring isn't straightforward when dealing with inequalities. Alternatively, since |a - b| is non-negative, maybe I can split into cases where a \u2265 b and a < b. But that might get messy. Let's see if there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express ab in terms of a\u00b2 + b\u00b2. Since a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 1, maybe express ab as ( (a + b)\u00b2 - (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) ) / 2. Let's try that. So ab = [ (a + b)\u00b2 - 1 ] / 2. Then the expression becomes [ (a + b)\u00b2 - 1 ] / 2 + |a - b|. Hmm, not sure if that helps yet.\n\nWait, maybe consider substituting variables. Let me set a = cos\u03b8 and b = sin\u03b8, since a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 1. Then ab = cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8, and |a - b| = |cos\u03b8 - sin\u03b8|. Then the expression becomes cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8 + |cos\u03b8 - sin\u03b8|. Let's compute this.\n\nFirst, cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8 = (1/2) sin2\u03b8. And |cos\u03b8 - sin\u03b8| can be written as sqrt( (cos\u03b8 - sin\u03b8)\u00b2 ) = sqrt(1 - 2cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8 ), since cos\u00b2\u03b8 + sin\u00b2\u03b8 = 1, so (cos\u03b8 - sin\u03b8)\u00b2 = 1 - 2cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8. Wait, but sqrt(1 - 2cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8) is |cos\u03b8 - sin\u03b8|. So the expression becomes (1/2) sin2\u03b8 + sqrt(1 - sin2\u03b8). Hmm, maybe this substitution can help find the maximum value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use variables substitution. Let me set x = a - b. Then |x| is part of the expression. Also, since a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 1, perhaps express ab in terms of x. Let's see. Let x = a - b. Then a = b + x. Substitute into a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 1: (b + x)\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 1 \u2192 b\u00b2 + 2bx + x\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 1 \u2192 2b\u00b2 + 2bx + x\u00b2 = 1. Not sure if that helps. Maybe another substitution.\n\nAlternatively, consider that ab + |a - b| \u2264 1. Let's try to bound each term. Since a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 =1, by Cauchy-Schwarz, |ab| \u2264 (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)/2 = 1/2. So ab \u2264 1/2. But |a - b| can be up to sqrt(2), but since a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 =1, the maximum |a - b| would be when a and b are orthogonal? Wait, no. Let's compute |a - b|. The maximum of |a - b| under a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 =1. Let's see, (a - b)\u00b2 = a\u00b2 - 2ab + b\u00b2 = 1 - 2ab. So |a - b| = sqrt(1 - 2ab). Wait, but then ab + sqrt(1 - 2ab) \u22641. Let me check that.\n\nWait, if I let ab = t, then the expression becomes t + sqrt(1 - 2t). But since a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 =1, the maximum possible value of ab is 1/2 (since by AM \u2265 GM, ab \u2264 (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)/2 = 1/2). So t \u22641/2. Also, 1 - 2t must be non-negative, so 1 - 2t \u22650 \u2192 t \u22641/2, which matches. So the domain of t is t \u22641/2. So we need to show that t + sqrt(1 - 2t) \u22641 for t \u22641/2.\n\nLet me set f(t) = t + sqrt(1 - 2t). Find the maximum of f(t) for t \u22641/2. Take derivative: f\u2019(t) = 1 + ( -2 )/(2 sqrt(1 - 2t)) ) = 1 - 1/sqrt(1 - 2t). Set derivative to zero: 1 - 1/sqrt(1 - 2t) =0 \u2192 sqrt(1 - 2t) =1 \u2192 1 -2t =1 \u2192 t=0. So critical point at t=0. Check endpoints. As t approaches -infty, sqrt(1-2t) becomes large, but t is bounded below by when a and b are real. Wait, but a and b are real numbers with a\u00b2 + b\u00b2=1, so ab can be as low as -1/2 (since when a=1, b=0, ab=0; but if a and b are negatives, maybe ab can be negative. Wait, for example, if a=1/\u221a2 and b=1/\u221a2, then ab=1/2. If a=1/\u221a2 and b=-1/\u221a2, then ab=-1/2. So t can range from -1/2 to 1/2. Wait, but earlier I thought t \u22641/2, but actually, the minimum is when a and b are negatives. Wait, let's check.\n\nIf a and b are real numbers with a\u00b2 + b\u00b2=1, then the maximum of ab is 1/2 (achieved at a=b=1/\u221a2), and the minimum is -1/2 (achieved at a=1/\u221a2, b=-1/\u221a2). So t \u2208 [-1/2, 1/2]. So the domain of t is from -1/2 to 1/2.\n\nSo the function f(t) = t + sqrt(1 - 2t) for t \u2208 [-1/2, 1/2]. Wait, but when t is negative, say t=-1/2, then sqrt(1 -2*(-1/2))=sqrt(1 +1)=sqrt(2). So f(-1/2)= -1/2 + sqrt(2) \u2248 -0.5 +1.414\u22480.914, which is less than 1. At t=0, f(0)=0 +1=1. At t=1/2, sqrt(1 -2*(1/2))=sqrt(0)=0, so f(1/2)=1/2 +0=1/2 <1. So the maximum seems to be at t=0, where f(t)=1. So the maximum value of f(t) is 1, achieved when t=0. Therefore, ab + |a -b| \u22641, with equality when ab=0 and |a -b|=1. When ab=0, either a=0 or b=0. If a=0, then b\u00b2=1, so b=\u00b11, then |a -b|=1, so expression is 0 +1=1. Similarly if b=0, a=\u00b11, same result. So equality holds when either a=0 and b=\u00b11, or b=0 and a=\u00b11.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"show that ab + |a -b| \u22641\". So according to this analysis, the maximum is indeed 1, achieved at those points. So this seems to work. But let me check if there's another approach.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider squaring both sides. But since we have an absolute value, maybe we can square after handling the absolute value. Let me write |a -b| as sqrt( (a -b)^2 ). Then the expression is ab + sqrt( (a -b)^2 ). Let me denote S = ab + |a -b|. We need to show S \u22641.\n\nLet me square both sides. But S is ab + |a -b|. Squaring gives S\u00b2 = (ab)^2 + 2ab|a -b| + (a -b)^2. But this might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps use the fact that (a -b)^2 = a\u00b2 -2ab +b\u00b2 =1 -2ab. So |a -b|=sqrt(1 -2ab). So S = ab + sqrt(1 -2ab). Let me set x = ab. Then S =x + sqrt(1 -2x). We need to show that x + sqrt(1 -2x) \u22641 for x \u2208 [-1/2, 1/2].\n\nLet me consider the function f(x) =x + sqrt(1 -2x). Find its maximum in the interval x \u2208 [-1/2, 1/2]. Take derivative: f\u2019(x)=1 + (-2)/(2 sqrt(1 -2x)) )=1 -1/sqrt(1 -2x). Set derivative to zero: 1 -1/sqrt(1 -2x)=0 \u2192 sqrt(1 -2x)=1 \u21921 -2x=1 \u2192x=0. So critical point at x=0. Check the value there: f(0)=0 +1=1. Check endpoints: at x=1/2, f(1/2)=1/2 +0=1/2. At x=-1/2, f(-1/2)= -1/2 +sqrt(1 -2*(-1/2))= -1/2 +sqrt(2)\u2248-0.5+1.414\u22480.914<1. So maximum is indeed 1 at x=0. Therefore, S \u22641, with equality when x=0, i.e., ab=0. Which happens when either a=0 or b=0. Then, since a\u00b2 +b\u00b2=1, if a=0, then b=\u00b11, and |a -b|=1, so S=0 +1=1. Similarly if b=0, a=\u00b11, same result. So equality holds there.\n\nTherefore, the inequality holds, and the maximum is achieved at those points. So the proof is complete.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nWe need to show that for real numbers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) satisfying \\( a^2 + b^2 = 1 \\), the expression \\( ab + |a - b| \\) is always less than or equal to 1. \n\n**Step 1: Simplify \\( |a - b| \\) using the given condition.**  \nSince \\( a^2 + b^2 = 1 \\), we can express \\( |a - b| \\) as:\n\\[\n|a - b| = \\sqrt{(a - b)^2} = \\sqrt{a^2 - 2ab + b^2} = \\sqrt{1 - 2ab}.\n\\]\nThus, the expression becomes:\n\\[\nab + \\sqrt{1 - 2ab}.\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the function \\( f(ab) = ab + \\sqrt{1 - 2ab} \\).**  \nLet \\( t = ab \\).

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to prove that if a function f from the positive integers to itself satisfies f(n+1) > f(f(n)) for every positive integer n, then f(n) must equal n for all n. Hmm. Alright, let's start by understanding what the condition f(n+1) > f(f(n)) really means. \n\nFirst, maybe I should try some small values of n to see what's going on. Let's start with n=1. Then the condition becomes f(2) > f(f(1)). Since f maps to positive integers, f(1) has to be at least 1. Suppose f(1)=1. Then f(f(1))=f(1)=1, so f(2) > 1. That means f(2) is at least 2. If f(2)=2, then for n=2, f(3) > f(f(2))=f(2)=2, so f(3) \u22653. Continuing this way, maybe f(n)=n for all n. But what if f(1) is not 1? Suppose f(1)=k where k>1. Then f(f(1))=f(k). But then f(2) > f(k). But since k>1, f(k) is at least 1, but we need to see if this leads to a contradiction.\n\nWait, maybe assuming f(1)\u22601 leads to a problem. Let's suppose f(1)=2. Then f(f(1))=f(2). The condition for n=1 becomes f(2) > f(2), which is impossible. So f(1) can't be 2. Similarly, if f(1)=3, then f(2) > f(3). But then for n=2, f(3) > f(f(2)). If f(2) is some number, say m, then f(3) > f(m). But this seems like it could create a chain of inequalities that might not hold. Maybe this implies that f(1) must be 1 to avoid immediate contradictions.\n\nAssuming f(1)=1, then f(2) > f(f(1))=f(1)=1, so f(2)\u22652. If f(2)=2, then for n=2, f(3) > f(f(2))=f(2)=2, so f(3)\u22653. Continuing, if f(n)=n for all n up to some k, then for n=k, f(k+1) > f(f(k))=f(k)=k, so f(k+1)\u2265k+1. But since f maps to positive integers, f(k+1) can't be more than k+1, otherwise there's a jump. Wait, but the function could in theory take larger values. Hmm, maybe there's a way to show that f(n) can't exceed n.\n\nSuppose for some n, f(n) > n. Let's take the smallest such n. Then for n-1, f(n) > f(f(n-1)). But since n is the smallest where f(n) > n, f(n-1) \u2264 n-1. So f(f(n-1)) \u2264 f(n-1) \u2264 n-1. Then f(n) > n-1. But f(n) > n, so this seems possible. Wait, maybe this approach isn't leading me anywhere.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use induction. Assume that for all m < n, f(m) = m. Then show f(n) = n. For n=1, as before, f(1)=1. Suppose for all m < k, f(m)=m. Then for n=k-1, f(k) > f(f(k-1))=f(k-1)=k-1. So f(k) \u2265k. But also, since f maps to positive integers, if f(k) >k, then for some later n, say n=k, f(k+1) > f(f(k)). But f(k) >k, so f(f(k)) \u2265 f(k+1) > f(f(k)), which would be a contradiction. Wait, maybe that's the key. If f(k) >k, then f(f(k)) \u2265 f(k+1), but the condition says f(k+1) > f(f(k)), leading to f(k+1) > f(k+1), which is impossible. Therefore, f(k) cannot be greater than k, so f(k)=k.\n\nYes, that seems promising. Let me try to formalize that thought. Suppose there exists some k where f(k) >k. Take the smallest such k. Then for n=k-1, the condition gives f(k) > f(f(k-1)). But since k is the smallest with f(k) >k, f(k-1)=k-1. So f(k) > f(k-1)=k-1. But f(k) >k, which is allowed. Wait, this doesn't immediately lead to a contradiction. Maybe I need to look further ahead.\n\nIf f(k) >k, then consider n=k. The condition says f(k+1) > f(f(k)). But f(k) >k, so f(f(k)) \u2265 f(k+1) (since f(k) >k, and f is a function from N+ to N+). Wait, but f(k+1) > f(f(k)) \u2265 f(k+1), which would imply f(k+1) > f(k+1), a contradiction. Therefore, our assumption that f(k) >k must be false. Hence, f(k) \u2264k for all k.\n\nBut earlier, from the condition, for n=k-1, f(k) > f(f(k-1))=f(k-1)=k-1. So f(k) >k-1. Since f(k) \u2264k, the only possibility is f(k)=k. Therefore, by induction, f(n)=n for all n.\n\nThat seems to work. Let me check with n=1. If f(1)=1, then for n=1, f(2) > f(f(1))=f(1)=1, so f(2)\u22652. But from the induction step, f(2)=2. Then for n=2, f(3) > f(f(2))=f(2)=2, so f(3)\u22653, and by induction f(3)=3. Continuing this way, all f(n)=n. If at any point f(k) >k, it leads to a contradiction when considering n=k. Therefore, the only function satisfying the condition is f(n)=n.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo prove that if a function \\( f: \\mathbb{N}^{+} \\to \\mathbb{N}^{+} \\) satisfies \\( f(n+1) > f(f(n)) \\) for every positive integer \\( n \\), then \\( f(n) = n \\) for all \\( n \\), we proceed by induction and contradiction.\n\n**Base Case (\\( n = 1 \\)):**\n- Suppose \\( f(1) \\neq 1 \\).

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking for the value of the expression -a - b\u00b2 + 3ab when a = -1 and b = 5. We need to show that the result is -39. \n\nFirst, I'll start by recalling that substituting values into an algebraic expression involves replacing each variable with the given number. Here, a is -1 and b is 5. So every 'a' in the expression becomes -1, and every 'b' becomes 5. Let's write down the original expression again to make sure I have it right: -a - b\u00b2 + 3ab.\n\nLet me break this down term by term. The first term is -a. Since a is -1, substituting that in gives -(-1). The negative of a negative is positive, so this becomes +1. \n\nNext, the second term is -b\u00b2. Here, b is 5, so b squared is 5\u00b2, which is 25. Then applying the negative sign gives -25. \n\nThe third term is 3ab. Substituting a = -1 and b = 5 here, we get 3 * (-1) * 5. Let's compute that: 3 times -1 is -3, and then -3 times 5 is -15. \n\nNow, putting all these terms together: the first term is +1, the second is -25, and the third is -15. Adding them up: 1 - 25 - 15. Let's do the math step by step. 1 minus 25 is -24, and then subtracting 15 more gives -24 -15, which equals -39. \n\nWait, let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the first term, -a when a is -1: yes, that's -(-1) = 1. Correct. For the second term, -b\u00b2: since exponentiation comes before multiplication (order of operations), it's definitely -(5\u00b2) = -25. If it were (-b)\u00b2, that would be different, but here it's correctly calculated as -25. \n\nThird term: 3ab. 3 times a (-1) is -3, times b (5) is -15. Correct. Adding them: 1 -25 is indeed -24, then -24 -15 is -39. \n\nHmm, maybe another way to look at it is to substitute all variables first and then compute. Let's rewrite the entire expression with substitutions:\n\nOriginal expression: -a - b\u00b2 + 3ab\n\nSubstitute a = -1, b =5:\n\n-(-1) - (5)\u00b2 + 3*(-1)*(5)\n\nCompute each part:\n\n-(-1) = 1\n\n(5)\u00b2 = 25, so -25\n\n3*(-1)*5 = 3*(-5) = -15\n\nNow sum them: 1 -25 -15. \n\n1 -25 is -24, then -24 -15 is -39. Yep, that checks out. \n\nI think that's solid. All steps follow basic substitution and order of operations. No steps skipped here. The key points are handling the signs correctly, especially with the negative a and the negative in front of b squared. Also, making sure that multiplication is done before addition and subtraction. Since all the operations here are straightforward, the result should indeed be -39.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo find the value of the expression \\(-a - b^2 + 3ab\\) when \\(a = -1\\) and \\(b = 5\\), we substitute the given values into the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Substitute \\(a = -1\\) and \\(b = 5\\) into each term:**\n   - The first term is \\(-a\\):  \n     \\(-(-1) = 1\\) (since the negative of \\(-1\\) is \\(1\\)).\n   - The second term is \\(-b^2\\):  \n     \\(-(5^2) = -25\\) (compute \\(5^2 = 25\\), then apply the negative sign).\n   - The third term is \\(3ab\\):  \n     \\(3 \\cdot (-1) \\cdot 5 = -15\\) (multiply \\(3 \\cdot -1 = -3\\), then \\(-3 \\cdot 5 = -15\\)).\n\n2. **Combine the results:**  \n   Add the computed values of the three terms:  \n   \\(1 - 25 - 15\\).\n\n3. **Simplify the sum:**  \n   - \\(1 - 25 = -24\\).  \n   - \\(-24 - 15 = -39\\).\n\nThus, substituting \\(a = -1\\) and \\(b = 5\\) into \\(-a - b^2 + 3ab\\) yields \\(-39\\).

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking for a unique positive integer n such that log\u2082(log\u2081\u2086n) equals log\u2084(log\u2084n). Then, we need to find the sum of the digits of this n, which is given as one of the options, and we need to show it's E) 13.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the equation given. Let's write it out again:\n\nlog\u2082(log\u2081\u2086n) = log\u2084(log\u2084n)\n\nHmm, logarithms with different bases here. Maybe converting them to the same base would help. Let's recall that log\u2090b can be converted to log base c using the change of base formula: log\u2090b = (log_c b)/(log_c a). Let's try to express all logs in terms of base 2 since 16 is 2\u2074 and 4 is 2\u00b2. That might simplify things.\n\nStarting with the left side: log\u2082(log\u2081\u2086n). Let's first handle log\u2081\u2086n. Since 16 is 2\u2074, log\u2081\u2086n is the same as log_{2\u2074}n. Using logarithm properties, log_{2\u2074}n = (log\u2082n)/(log\u20822\u2074) = (log\u2082n)/4. So log\u2081\u2086n = (log\u2082n)/4. Therefore, the left side becomes log\u2082((log\u2082n)/4).\n\nNow the right side: log\u2084(log\u2084n). Similarly, 4 is 2\u00b2, so log\u2084n = (log\u2082n)/(log\u20824) = (log\u2082n)/2. Therefore, log\u2084(log\u2084n) is log\u2084 of (log\u2082n)/2. Let's express log\u2084 in terms of base 2. Since log\u2084x = (log\u2082x)/log\u20824 = (log\u2082x)/2. So log\u2084((log\u2082n)/2) = [log\u2082((log\u2082n)/2)] / 2.\n\nPutting it all together, the original equation becomes:\n\nlog\u2082((log\u2082n)/4) = [log\u2082((log\u2082n)/2)] / 2\n\nHmm, that looks a bit complicated. Let's denote y = log\u2082n to simplify the equation. Then, substituting:\n\nLeft side: log\u2082(y/4)\nRight side: [log\u2082(y/2)] / 2\n\nSo the equation is:\n\nlog\u2082(y/4) = (1/2) * log\u2082(y/2)\n\nLet me simplify both sides. Let's compute the left side first. log\u2082(y/4) = log\u2082y - log\u20824 = log\u2082y - 2.\n\nThe right side: (1/2)*log\u2082(y/2) = (1/2)(log\u2082y - log\u20822) = (1/2)(log\u2082y - 1) = (log\u2082y)/2 - 1/2.\n\nSo now the equation is:\n\nlog\u2082y - 2 = (log\u2082y)/2 - 1/2\n\nLet's solve for log\u2082y. Let me denote z = log\u2082y for clarity. Then the equation becomes:\n\nz - 2 = (z/2) - 1/2\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate denominators:\n\n2z - 4 = z - 1\n\nSubtract z from both sides:\n\nz - 4 = -1\n\nAdd 4 to both sides:\n\nz = 3\n\nBut z = log\u2082y, so:\n\nlog\u2082y = 3 => y = 2\u00b3 = 8\n\nBut y = log\u2082n, so:\n\nlog\u2082n = 8 => n = 2\u2078 = 256\n\nWait, so n is 256. Let's check if this works in the original equation.\n\nFirst, compute log\u2081\u2086n. Since n=256, log\u2081\u2086256. 16 squared is 256, so log\u2081\u2086256 = 2. Then log\u2082(log\u2081\u2086n) = log\u20822 = 1.\n\nNow compute log\u2084(log\u2084n). log\u2084256. 4^4 = 256, so log\u2084256 = 4. Then log\u20844 = 1. So log\u2084(log\u2084n) = log\u20844 = 1.\n\nSo both sides equal 1. Therefore, n=256 is indeed the solution. The problem states there's a unique positive integer, so this must be the one.\n\nNow, the sum of the digits of 256. The digits are 2, 5, and 6. Adding them: 2 + 5 + 6 = 13. So the answer is E) 13.\n\nWait, but let me double-check everything to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's verify each step.\n\nFirst, converting log\u2081\u2086n to base 2: yes, since 16 is 2^4, log\u2081\u2086n = (log\u2082n)/4. Similarly, log\u2084n = (log\u2082n)/2. Then substituting into the original equation, that's correct.\n\nThen substituting y = log\u2082n, leading to the equation log\u2082(y/4) = (1/2)log\u2082(y/2). Simplifying both sides correctly: log\u2082(y/4) is log\u2082y - 2, and the right side becomes (1/2)(log\u2082y -1) which is (log\u2082y)/2 - 1/2. Then solving for log\u2082y gives z=3, so y=8, hence n=2^8=256. Sum of digits 2+5+6=13. All steps check out. Seems correct.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo solve the equation \\(\\log_2{(\\log_{16}{n})} = \\log_4{(\\log_4{n})}\\), we start by simplifying the logarithms using base conversions. \n\n1. **Convert \\(\\log_{16}{n}\\) to base 2**:  \n   Since \\(16 = 2^4\\), we use the change-of-base formula:  \n   \\[\n   \\log_{16}{n} = \\frac{\\log_2{n}}{\\log_2{16}} = \\frac{\\log_2{n}}{4}.\n   \\]  \n   Thus, the left side of the equation becomes:  \n   \\[\n   \\log_2{\\left(\\frac{\\log_2{n}}{4}\\right)}.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Convert \\(\\log_4{n}\\) and \\(\\log_4{(\\log_4{n})}\\) to base 2**:  \n   Since \\(4 = 2^2\\), we have:  \n   \\[\n   \\log_4{n} = \\frac{\\log_2{n}}{2}.\n   \\]  \n   Substituting this into the right side of the equation:  \n   \\[\n   \\log_4{\\left(\\frac{\\log_2{n}}{2}\\right)} = \\frac{\\log_2{\\left(\\frac{\\log_2{n}}{2}\\right)}}{\\log_2{4}} = \\frac{\\log_2{\\left(\\frac{\\log_2{n}}{2}\\right)}}{2}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Simplify the equation**:  \n   Let \\(y = \\log_2{n}\\).

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this inequality: (4x\u00b2)/(1 - \u221a(2x + 1))\u00b2 < 2x + 9. Hmm, first, I need to figure out for which x this holds. Let me start by understanding the domain of the expression. The denominator has a square root, \u221a(2x + 1), so the argument inside must be non-negative. That means 2x + 1 \u2265 0 \u2192 x \u2265 -1/2. Also, the denominator is (1 - \u221a(2x + 1))\u00b2. Since it's squared, it's always non-negative, but we can't have the denominator zero. So 1 - \u221a(2x + 1) \u2260 0 \u2192 \u221a(2x + 1) \u2260 1 \u2192 2x + 1 \u2260 1 \u2192 2x \u2260 0 \u2192 x \u2260 0. So the domain is x \u2265 -1/2 and x \u2260 0.\n\nNext, let's simplify the inequality. The left side is a fraction, and the right side is linear. Maybe cross-multiplying? But wait, since the denominator is squared, it's always positive except when x=0, which is excluded. So the denominator is positive for all x in the domain. Therefore, multiplying both sides by the denominator won't change the inequality direction. So:\n\n4x\u00b2 < (2x + 9)(1 - \u221a(2x + 1))\u00b2.\n\nBut expanding the right side might get messy. Let me think of a substitution. Let\u2019s set t = \u221a(2x + 1). Then t \u2265 0 because it's a square root. Also, from the domain, x \u2265 -1/2, so 2x +1 \u2265 0, which matches. Then, solving for x: t\u00b2 = 2x +1 \u2192 x = (t\u00b2 -1)/2. Substitute this into the inequality.\n\nOriginal inequality becomes:\n\n4*((t\u00b2 -1)/2)\u00b2 / (1 - t)\u00b2 < 2*((t\u00b2 -1)/2) + 9.\n\nSimplify left side: 4*( (t\u00b2 -1)^2 /4 ) / (1 - t)^2 = (t\u00b2 -1)^2 / (1 - t)^2.\n\nNote that (t\u00b2 -1) = (t -1)(t +1), so (t\u00b2 -1)^2 = (t -1)^2(t +1)^2. Then denominator is (1 - t)^2 = (t -1)^2. So left side simplifies to [(t -1)^2(t +1)^2]/(t -1)^2) = (t +1)^2. So left side is (t +1)^2.\n\nRight side: 2*((t\u00b2 -1)/2) +9 = (t\u00b2 -1) +9 = t\u00b2 +8.\n\nSo inequality becomes (t +1)^2 < t\u00b2 +8.\n\nExpand left side: t\u00b2 + 2t +1 < t\u00b2 +8. Subtract t\u00b2 from both sides: 2t +1 <8 \u2192 2t <7 \u2192 t <7/2.\n\nBut t = \u221a(2x +1) \u22650. So t <7/2. Therefore, \u221a(2x +1) <7/2. Square both sides: 2x +1 <49/4 \u2192 2x <49/4 -1 =45/4 \u2192 x <45/8. But x must also be in the domain: x \u2265-1/2 and x \u22600. So combining these, x \u2208 [-1/2, 45/8) but x \u22600.\n\nWait, but let me check if there are any other constraints. The substitution step assumes t \u22601 because in the original substitution, when t=1, the denominator becomes (1 -1)^2=0, which is excluded. So t=1 corresponds to x=(1 -1)/2=0, which is already excluded. So t cannot be 1, which is already handled by x\u22600.\n\nSo the solution is x in [-1/2, 45/8) excluding 0. But wait, let's verify with t <7/2. Since t=\u221a(2x+1), t can be up to 7/2, so x can be up to ( (7/2)^2 -1 )/2 = (49/4 -1)/2 = (45/4)/2 =45/8, which is 5.625. So x <45/8. But also, x \u2265-1/2. So the interval is [-1/2, 45/8) with x\u22600.\n\nBut wait, let's check if the substitution is reversible. When we squared both sides of \u221a(2x +1) <7/2, we need to ensure that 2x +1 is non-negative, which is already part of the domain. So squaring is safe here.\n\nBut let me test some points to confirm. For example, take x=0: excluded. x=1: check original inequality. Left side: denominator is (1 -\u221a3)^2. Numerator 4*1=4. So left side is 4/(1 -\u221a3)^2. Right side is 2*1 +9=11. Let's compute left side: (1 -\u221a3)^2 \u2248 (1 -1.732)^2 \u2248 (-0.732)^2\u22480.536. So 4/0.536\u22487.46, which is less than 11. So inequality holds at x=1. But according to our solution, x=1 is in [-1/2,45/8) and x\u22600, so included. Correct.\n\nAnother test: x=5.625 (45/8=5.625). At x=45/8, the inequality becomes equality? Let's check. At x=45/8, \u221a(2x+1)=\u221a(2*(45/8)+1)=\u221a(90/8 +1)=\u221a(90/8 +8/8)=\u221a(98/8)=\u221a(49/4)=7/2. So t=7/2. Then left side (t+1)^2=(7/2 +1)^2=(9/2)^2=81/4. Right side t\u00b2 +8=(49/4)+8=49/4 +32/4=81/4. So equality holds at x=45/8, but the original inequality is strict, so x=45/8 is excluded. Correct.\n\nAnother test: x=-1/2. Let's check. x=-1/2: \u221a(2*(-1/2)+1)=\u221a(-1 +1)=\u221a0=0. Denominator becomes (1 -0)^2=1. Left side:4*( (-1/2)^2 ) /1=4*(1/4)=1. Right side:2*(-1/2)+9= -1 +9=8. So 1 <8, which holds. So x=-1/2 is included. Correct.\n\nWhat about x approaching 0 from the left? Wait, x can't be less than -1/2. So x approaching 0 from the positive side. Let x=0.1. Then \u221a(2*0.1 +1)=\u221a(1.2)\u22481.095. Denominator (1 -1.095)^2\u22480.009. Left side:4*(0.1)^2 /0.009\u22484*0.01/0.009\u22480.04/0.009\u22484.444. Right side:2*0.1 +9=0.2+9=9.2. So 4.444 <9.2, holds. So x near 0 is okay except x=0.\n\nWait, but x=0 is excluded. So the solution is all x in [-1/2, 45/8) except x=0. But let me check if there's any other point where the inequality might not hold. For example, x=5 (which is less than 45/8=5.625). Left side: denominator (1 -\u221a11)^2\u2248(1-3.316)^2\u2248( -2.316)^2\u22485.364. Numerator 4*25=100. Left side\u2248100/5.364\u224818.64. Right side:2*5 +9=19. So 18.64 <19, which holds. So x=5 is okay.\n\nAt x=5.625, as before, equality. So the solution seems correct.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo determine for which real numbers \\( x \\) the inequality \\(\\dfrac{4x^2}{(1 - \\sqrt {2x + 1})^2} < 2x + 9\\) holds, we proceed as follows:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the domain**  \nThe expression involves \\(\\sqrt{2x + 1}\\), so the radicand must be non-negative:  \n\\(2x + 1 \\geq 0 \\implies x \\geq -\\dfrac{1}{2}\\).  \nAdditionally, the denominator \\((1 - \\sqrt{2x + 1})^2\\) cannot be zero:  \n\\(1 - \\sqrt{2x + 1} \\neq 0 \\implies \\sqrt{2x + 1} \\neq 1 \\implies x \\neq 0\\).  \nThus, the domain is \\(x \\in \\left[-\\dfrac{1}{2}, \\infty\\right) \\setminus \\{0\\}\\).\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the inequality**  \nLet \\( t = \\sqrt{2x + 1} \\geq 0 \\). Then \\( t^2 = 2x + 1 \\implies x = \\dfrac{t^2 - 1}{2} \\).

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the sum of the distinct prime divisors of A, where A is the sum of the positive divisors of 500. And the answer should be 25. Let me think about how to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the sum of the divisors function, often denoted as \u03c3\u2081(n), gives the sum of all positive divisors of a number n. So A here is \u03c3\u2081(500). To find \u03c3\u2081(500), I need to factorize 500 into its prime factors first. Let's see, 500 divided by 2 is 250, divided by 2 again is 125, which is 5 cubed. So 500 is 2\u00b2 \u00d7 5\u00b3. Right, so the prime factorization is 2\u00b2 * 5\u00b3.\n\nNow, the formula for the divisor sum of a number n = p\u2081^a\u2081 * p\u2082^a\u2082 * ... * p_k^a_k is the product of (p_i^(a_i + 1) - 1)/(p_i - 1) for each prime factor. So applying that here, for 2\u00b2, the sum would be (2\u00b3 - 1)/(2 - 1) = (8 - 1)/1 = 7. For 5\u00b3, it's (5\u2074 - 1)/(5 - 1) = (625 - 1)/4 = 624/4 = 156. Then multiply these two results: 7 * 156. Let me calculate that. 7*150 is 1050, and 7*6 is 42, so total is 1050 + 42 = 1092. So A = 1092.\n\nNow, I need to find the sum of the distinct prime divisors of A, which is 1092. So first, factorize 1092 into its prime factors. Let's start dividing by small primes. 1092 is even, so divide by 2: 1092 / 2 = 546. Still even, divide by 2 again: 546 / 2 = 273. Now 273 is odd. Check divisibility by 3: 2 + 7 + 3 = 12, which is divisible by 3. So 273 / 3 = 91. Now 91: 7*13 = 91. So the prime factors of 1092 are 2\u00b2 * 3 * 7 * 13. The distinct primes are 2, 3, 7, and 13. Wait, but the problem says the sum should be 25. Let's add them up: 2 + 3 + 7 + 13 = 25. Oh, that matches! So the answer is indeed 25.\n\nWait, but let me double-check everything to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's verify the divisor sum again. 500 = 2\u00b2 * 5\u00b3. The formula gives (2\u00b3 -1)/(2-1) = 7 and (5\u2074 -1)/(5-1) = 624/4 = 156. 7*156 = 1092. Correct. Then factorizing 1092: 1092 divided by 2 is 546, divided by 2 again is 273. 273 divided by 3 is 91, which is 7*13. So primes are 2, 3, 7, 13. Sum is 2+3+7+13=25. Yep, that's right. So the answer is 25.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo determine the sum of the distinct prime divisors of \\( A \\), where \\( A \\) is the sum of the positive divisors of 500, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Prime Factorization of 500**:  \n   First, factorize 500 into its prime components.  \n   \\( 500 = 2^2 \\times 5^3 \\).\n\n2. **Compute the Divisor Sum \\( \\sigma_1(500) \\)**  \n   The divisor sum formula for \\( n = p_1^{a_1} \\times p_2^{a_2} \\times \\dots \\times p_k^{a_k} \\) is:  \n   \\[\n   \\sigma_1(n) = \\prod_{i=1}^k \\frac{p_i^{a_i + 1} - 1}{p_i - 1}\n   \\]  \n   Apply this to 500:  \n   - For \\( 2^2 \\): \\( \\frac{2^{3} - 1}{2 - 1} = \\frac{8 - 1}{1} = 7 \\).  \n   - For \\( 5^3 \\): \\( \\frac{5^{4} - 1}{5 - 1} = \\frac{625 - 1}{4} = \\frac{624}{4} = 156 \\).  \n   Multiply the results: \\( 7 \\times 156 = 1092 \\).  \n   Thus, \\( A = 1092 \\).\n\n3. **Prime Factorization of \\( A = 1092 \\)**  \n   Break down 1092 into primes:  \n   - \\( 1092 \\div 2 = 546 \\)  \n   - \\( 546 \\div 2 = 273 \\)  \n   - \\( 273 \\div 3 = 91 \\)  \n   - \\( 91 = 7 \\times 13 \\).  \n   Hence, \\( 1092 = 2^2 \\times 3 \\times 7 \\times 13 \\).\n\n4. **Sum of Distinct Prime Divisors**  \n   The distinct primes in \\( 1092 \\) are \\( 2, 3, 7, 13 \\).  \n   Sum them: \\( 2 + 3 + 7 + 13 = 25 \\).\n\n**Conclusion**: The sum of the distinct prime divisors of

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to show that for any integers x and y, x\u2075 is not equal to y\u00b2 plus 4. Hmm. Let me think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst, maybe I should consider possible values of x and y and see if there's a pattern or a contradiction. But since this has to hold for all integers, checking individual cases isn't enough. I need a general proof.\n\nThe problem reminds me of equations where you have a higher power on one side and a lower power on the other, like Fermat's Last Theorem, but that's about sums of powers. Here, it's a difference. Wait, the context given was about the difference of two fifth powers, but the problem here is different. The context theorem factors x\u2075 - y\u2075, but maybe that's not directly applicable. Or is there a way to use that factorization here?\n\nWait, the problem is x\u2075 \u2260 y\u00b2 +4 for any integers x and y. So suppose, for contradiction, that there exist integers x and y such that x\u2075 = y\u00b2 +4. Then, rearranged, x\u2075 - y\u00b2 =4. Hmm. Maybe I can analyze this equation modulo some number to find a contradiction.\n\nModular arithmetic is often useful for showing equations have no solutions. Let's think about possible moduli. Let's try modulo 5, since the left side is x\u2075. Fermat's Little Theorem says that for prime p, x^(p-1) \u22611 mod p if x not divisible by p. But here, modulo 5, x\u2075 \u2261x mod 5, because 5 is prime, and x\u2075 \u2261x mod 5 by Fermat's Little Theorem. So x\u2075 mod5 is the same as x mod5. So the left side x\u2075 mod5 can be 0,1,2,3,4. The right side is y\u00b2 +4 mod5. Let's compute possible values of y\u00b2 mod5. Squares modulo 5 are 0,1,4. So y\u00b2 mod5 can be 0,1,4. Then y\u00b2 +4 mod5 would be (0+4)=4, (1+4)=0, (4+4)=8\u22613 mod5. So possible right sides mod5 are 0,3,4. The left side x\u2075 mod5 is x mod5, which can be 0,1,2,3,4. So if x\u2075 \u2261 y\u00b2 +4 mod5, then x \u22610,1,2,3,4 mod5 must equal 0,3,4. Let's check possible x mod5:\n\nIf x \u22610 mod5: Then left side is 0. Right side must be 0,3,4. So 0 \u22610,3,4 mod5. So possible if right side is 0. But y\u00b2 +4 \u22610 mod5 implies y\u00b2 \u22611 mod5 (since 0-4 \u22611 mod5). Wait, y\u00b2 \u22611 mod5. So y \u22611 or 4 mod5. So possible. So this case doesn't lead to contradiction.\n\nIf x \u22611 mod5: Left side is1. Right side must be 0,3,4. 1 not in {0,3,4} mod5. So contradiction here. So if x \u22611 mod5, then x\u2075 \u22611 mod5, but y\u00b2 +4 \u22610,3,4 mod5. So 1 \u22610,3,4 mod5? No. So this case is impossible. Therefore, if x \u22611 mod5, there's no solution. Similarly, check other x residues.\n\nx \u22612 mod5: Left side is2. Right side must be 0,3,4. 2 not in {0,3,4}, so contradiction. So x \u22612 mod5 impossible.\n\nx \u22613 mod5: Left side is3. Right side must be 0,3,4. So 3 is in the set. So possible. So when x \u22613 mod5, y\u00b2 +4 \u22613 mod5 \u2192 y\u00b2 \u2261-1 \u22614 mod5. Which is possible since y\u00b2 \u22614 mod5 when y \u22612 or 3 mod5. So this case is possible.\n\nx \u22614 mod5: Left side is4. Right side must be 0,3,4. So 4 is in the set. So possible. Then y\u00b2 +4 \u22614 mod5 \u2192 y\u00b2 \u22610 mod5. So y \u22610 mod5. So possible.\n\nSo the cases where x \u22610,3,4 mod5 are possible, but x \u22611,2 mod5 lead to contradictions. So maybe modulo 5 isn't enough. Need another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider modulo 11. Because 11 is a prime, and sometimes higher exponents have patterns. Let's see. Let's check x\u2075 mod11. By Fermat's Little Theorem, x^10 \u22611 mod11 if x not divisible by 11. So x^5 would be a square root of 1 mod11. So x^5 \u22611 or -1 mod11. So possible residues for x\u2075 mod11 are 0,1,10. Because if x \u22610 mod11, x\u2075 \u22610. Otherwise, x^10 \u22611, so x^5 \u2261\u00b11 mod11.\n\nSo x\u2075 mod11 can be 0,1,10. Then y\u00b2 +4 mod11. Let's compute possible y\u00b2 mod11. Squares mod11 are 0,1,3,4,5,9. So y\u00b2 can be 0,1,3,4,5,9. Then y\u00b2 +4 mod11 would be 4,5,7,8,9,13\u22612 mod11. So possible right sides mod11 are 0,1,10 (from x\u2075) and the right side is 2,4,5,7,8,9. So if x\u2075 \u2261 y\u00b2 +4 mod11, then possible x\u2075 residues (0,1,10) must match the right side residues (2,4,5,7,8,9). But 0,1,10 are not in {2,4,5,7,8,9} mod11. Therefore, there's a contradiction. Wait, that seems promising.\n\nWait, let me check again. If x\u2075 mod11 is 0,1,10. The right side y\u00b2 +4 mod11 is 2,4,5,7,8,9. So there's no overlap. Therefore, x\u2075 \u2261 y\u00b2 +4 mod11 would require that 0,1,10 is in {2,4,5,7,8,9}, which it's not. Therefore, the equation x\u2075 = y\u00b2 +4 has no solutions modulo11. Hence, no integer solutions exist. Therefore, the original statement is true.\n\nSo the key idea is to use modulo 11, where the possible residues of x\u2075 are 0,1,10, and the possible residues of y\u00b2 +4 are 2,4,5,7,8,9. Since there's no overlap, the equation can't hold modulo11, hence no solutions exist.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo show that there are no integers \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) such that \\( x^5 = y^2 + 4 \\), we use modular arithmetic to derive a contradiction. Specifically, we analyze the equation modulo \\( 11 \\), where patterns in fifth powers and squares simplify the problem.\n\n1. **Fifth powers modulo 11**:  \n   By Fermat\u2019s Little Theorem, for any integer \\( x \\) not divisible by \\( 11 \\), \\( x^{10} \\equiv 1 \\mod 11 \\). This implies \\( x^5 \\equiv \\pm 1 \\mod 11 \\). If \\( x \\equiv 0 \\mod 11 \\), then \\( x^5 \\equiv 0 \\mod 11 \\). Thus, \\( x^5 \\mod 11 \\) can only be \\( 0, 1, \\) or \\( 10 \\).\n\n2. **Squares modulo 11**:  \n   The possible residues of \\( y^2 \\mod 11 \\) are \\( 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9 \\). Adding \\( 4 \\) to these gives \\( y^2 + 4 \\mod 11 \\) as \\( 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 2 \\).\n\n3. **Contradiction**:  \n   For \\( x^5 \\equiv y^2 + 4 \\mod 11 \\), the left-hand side (\\( x^5 \\mod 11 \\)) must equal the right-hand side (\\( y^2 + 4 \\mod 11 \\)). However, the residues \\( 0, 1, 10 \\) (from \\( x^5 \\)) do not overlap with \\( 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9 \\) (from \\( y^2 + 4 \\)). This means the equation \\( x^5 = y^2 + 4 \\) cannot hold modulo \\( 11 \\), and thus no integer solutions exist. \n\nTherefore, \\( x^5 \\neq y^2 + 4 \\) for all integers \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about a series {a_n} where the sum of the squares from a\u2081 to a\u2081\u2080\u2080 is 1. We need to show that another sum involving products of consecutive terms and a term with a\u2081\u2080\u2080 and a\u2081 is less than 12/25. Hmm.\n\nFirst, let me parse the problem correctly. The given condition is the sum from n=0 to 99 of a_{n+1}\u00b2 equals 1. So that's like a\u2081\u00b2 + a\u2082\u00b2 + ... + a\u2081\u2080\u2080\u00b2 = 1. Then, the expression to bound is the sum from n=0 to 98 of (a_{n+1}\u00b2 a_{n+2}) plus a\u2081\u2080\u2080\u00b2 times a\u2081. So that's (a\u2081\u00b2 a\u2082 + a\u2082\u00b2 a\u2083 + ... + a\u2089\u2089\u00b2 a\u2081\u2080\u2080) + a\u2081\u2080\u2080\u00b2 a\u2081. And we need to show this is less than 12/25.\n\nHmm. The context given had an example about the sum of cubes up to 4\u00b3 equaling 100, but I'm not sure how that connects. Maybe it's a red herring. Let me focus on the problem at hand.\n\nI need to relate the given sum of squares to the sum involving products. Maybe use inequalities like Cauchy-Schwarz or AM-GM? Let's think. Since we have products of terms, perhaps applying Cauchy-Schwarz or H\u00f6lder's inequality could help here.\n\nWait, the terms are a_{n+1}\u00b2 a_{n+2}. That's a product of a squared term and another term. Maybe we can bound each term individually. Let's consider each term a_{k}\u00b2 a_{k+1}. How can we bound this?\n\nUsing AM-GM inequality? For example, for non-negative real numbers, the product is maximized when the terms are balanced. But here, the variables could be positive or negative. Wait, the problem doesn't specify if the a_n are real or complex, but since we're dealing with squares, probably real numbers. Let's assume they are real. But even so, the product could be positive or negative. However, the sum is a combination of such terms. But the problem states the sum is less than 12/25. So maybe all terms are positive? Or perhaps we need to take absolute values into account. Wait, the problem statement doesn't specify, but the original sum of squares is 1, which is non-negative. So maybe the a_n are real numbers, and the squares are non-negative. But the products could be positive or negative. However, the sum could be a mix. But the problem is to show that the entire sum is less than 12/25. So perhaps we need to bound the absolute value of the sum, but the problem states it's less than 12/25. Hmm. Maybe all terms are non-negative? Or perhaps there's a way to bound the sum regardless of signs.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use Cauchy-Schwarz. Let's think. Let's consider the sum S = sum_{k=1}^{99} a_k\u00b2 a_{k+1} + a\u2081\u2080\u2080\u00b2 a\u2081. Let's index the terms as k from 1 to 100, where each term is a_k\u00b2 a_{k+1}, with a_{101} being a\u2081 (since the last term is a\u2081\u2080\u2080\u00b2 a\u2081). So it's a cyclic sum.\n\nWait, the sum is from n=0 to 98, which gives terms from a\u2081\u00b2 a\u2082 up to a\u2089\u2089\u00b2 a\u2081\u2080\u2080, and then adding a\u2081\u2080\u2080\u00b2 a\u2081. So it's a cyclic sum over consecutive pairs. Interesting.\n\nSo, S = sum_{k=1}^{100} a_k\u00b2 a_{k+1}, where a_{101} = a\u2081. Now, how to bound this sum.\n\nGiven that sum_{k=1}^{100} a_k\u00b2 = 1. So we have a constraint on the sum of squares. The variables are the a_k's, and we need to maximize S under the constraint sum a_k\u00b2 = 1. Then show that the maximum is less than 12/25.\n\nSo this becomes an optimization problem: maximize S subject to sum a_k\u00b2 = 1. Then show that the maximum is less than 12/25.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use Lagrange multipliers. But since there are 100 variables, that's complicated. But perhaps there's symmetry or a pattern. Maybe the maximum occurs when all terms are equal, but given the cyclic structure, maybe the maximum occurs when two consecutive terms are non-zero, and the rest are zero. Let's test that.\n\nSuppose that only a\u2081 and a\u2082 are non-zero. Then sum a_k\u00b2 = a\u2081\u00b2 + a\u2082\u00b2 = 1. Then S would be a\u2081\u00b2 a\u2082 + a\u2082\u00b2 a\u2081 (since all other terms would be zero). Wait, but in this case, the sum would be a\u2081\u00b2 a\u2082 (from k=1) and a\u2082\u00b2 a\u2081 (from k=2), but wait, if only a\u2081 and a\u2082 are non-zero, then for k=1, a\u2081\u00b2 a\u2082, and for k=2, a\u2082\u00b2 a\u2083, but a\u2083 is zero, so that term is zero. Similarly, up to k=100, which would be a\u2081\u2080\u2080\u00b2 a\u2081, but a\u2081\u2080\u2080 is zero except if k=100, but in this case, a\u2081\u2080\u2080 is zero. Wait, maybe I messed up the indices.\n\nWait, if only a\u2081 and a\u2082 are non-zero, then:\n\n- For k=1: a\u2081\u00b2 a\u2082\n\n- For k=2: a\u2082\u00b2 a\u2083 = a\u2082\u00b2 * 0 = 0\n\n- Similarly, all other terms up to k=100: a\u2081\u2080\u2080\u00b2 a\u2081 = 0\u00b2 * a\u2081 = 0\n\nSo the sum S would be just a\u2081\u00b2 a\u2082. Then the maximum of a\u2081\u00b2 a\u2082 under a\u2081\u00b2 + a\u2082\u00b2 =1. Let's compute that.\n\nLet\u2019s set a\u2081 = x, a\u2082 = y, with x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =1. Then S = x\u00b2 y. To maximize x\u00b2 y under x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =1.\n\nExpress y in terms of x: y = sqrt(1 - x\u00b2). Then S = x\u00b2 sqrt(1 - x\u00b2). Take derivative with respect to x:\n\ndS/dx = 2x sqrt(1 - x\u00b2) + x\u00b2 * (-x)/sqrt(1 - x\u00b2) = [2x(1 - x\u00b2) - x\u00b3]/sqrt(1 - x\u00b2) = [2x - 2x\u00b3 - x\u00b3]/sqrt(1 - x\u00b2) = [2x -3x\u00b3]/sqrt(1 - x\u00b2)\n\nSet derivative to zero: 2x -3x\u00b3 =0 \u2192 x(2 -3x\u00b2)=0 \u2192 x=0 or x\u00b2=2/3. x=0 gives S=0. x\u00b2=2/3 \u2192 x=\u00b1\u221a(2/3). Then y= sqrt(1 -2/3)=sqrt(1/3). So S= (2/3) * (1/\u221a3) )= 2/(3\u221a3) \u2248 0.3849. Which is approximately 0.385, and 12/25 is 0.48. So this is less than 12/25. Hmm. But maybe this isn't the maximum.\n\nAlternatively, maybe having three consecutive non-zero terms gives a higher sum. Let's try a case where a\u2081, a\u2082, a\u2083 are non-zero. Then sum a\u2081\u00b2 +a\u2082\u00b2 +a\u2083\u00b2=1. Then S would have terms:\n\na\u2081\u00b2 a\u2082, a\u2082\u00b2 a\u2083, a\u2083\u00b2 a\u2084, ..., but a\u2084 and onwards are zero. So S = a\u2081\u00b2 a\u2082 + a\u2082\u00b2 a\u2083. Let's set a\u2081 = x, a\u2082 = y, a\u2083 = z, with x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 =1. Then S = x\u00b2 y + y\u00b2 z. To maximize this. But this seems more complex. Maybe symmetry here? If we set x=z, maybe. Let's suppose x=z. Then x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 +x\u00b2=1 \u2192 2x\u00b2 + y\u00b2=1. Then S= x\u00b2 y + y\u00b2 x. Let\u2019s set variables: Let\u2019s let x = t, y = s. Then 2t\u00b2 + s\u00b2=1. S= t\u00b2 s + s\u00b2 t = t s (t + s). Hmm. Not sure. Maybe take partial derivatives. Alternatively, use Lagrange multipliers. But this might get complicated. Alternatively, maybe the maximum occurs when two adjacent terms are non-zero, as in the first case. But in that case, the maximum was about 0.385, which is less than 12/25=0.48. So maybe even higher.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the maximum occurs when all terms are equal. Suppose all a_k are equal. Since there are 100 terms, each a_k = 1/\u221a100 = 1/10. Then sum a_k\u00b2 = 100*(1/100) =1, which satisfies the condition. Then S = sum_{k=1}^{100} (1/10)^2 * (1/10) = 100 * (1/1000) = 1/10 =0.1, which is 0.1 < 12/25. So that's way lower. So the maximum isn't here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a pattern where every other term is non-zero. For example, a\u2081, a\u2083, a\u2085,... are non-zero. But then the products would involve terms like a\u2081\u00b2 a\u2082, but a\u2082 is zero, so those terms would be zero. So that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a single term is non-zero. Suppose a\u2081=1, others zero. Then sum a_k\u00b2=1. Then S= a\u2081\u00b2 a\u2082 + ... +a\u2081\u2080\u2080\u00b2 a\u2081 =0, since all a_k except a\u2081 are zero. So S=0. Similarly for other single terms. So that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe two consecutive terms, but with more variables. Wait, earlier when we considered two terms, the maximum was about 0.385. But 12/25 is 0.48, so there's a gap. Maybe there's a better configuration.\n\nWait, perhaps three terms in a row. Let's say a\u2081, a\u2082, a\u2083 are non-zero. Then S would be a\u2081\u00b2 a\u2082 + a\u2082\u00b2 a\u2083 + a\u2083\u00b2 a\u2084 + ... But a\u2084 is zero, so only the first two terms. Wait, no, if a\u2081, a\u2082, a\u2083 are non-zero, then:\n\nFor k=1: a\u2081\u00b2 a\u2082\n\nk=2: a\u2082\u00b2 a\u2083\n\nk=3: a\u2083\u00b2 a\u2084 =0\n\n...\n\nk=100: a\u2081\u2080\u2080\u00b2 a\u2081=0 (since a\u2081\u2080\u2080 is zero). So S= a\u2081\u00b2 a\u2082 + a\u2082\u00b2 a\u2083.\n\nSo with three variables, x, y, z, with x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2=1. Then S= x\u00b2 y + y\u00b2 z. To maximize this. Let's try to set z=0. Then S= x\u00b2 y, with x\u00b2 + y\u00b2=1. Which is the same as the two-variable case. So maximum is 2/(3\u221a3) \u22480.385. So no gain here.\n\nAlternatively, set z non-zero. Let's see. Suppose x, y, z are all positive. Then S= x\u00b2 y + y\u00b2 z. Maybe set z proportional to y. For example, set z=ky for some k. Then x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2= x\u00b2 + y\u00b2(1 +k\u00b2)=1. Then S= x\u00b2 y + y\u00b2 z= x\u00b2 y + k y\u00b3. Let's express x\u00b2=1 - y\u00b2(1 +k\u00b2). Then S= (1 - y\u00b2(1 +k\u00b2)) y + k y\u00b3= y - y\u00b3(1 +k\u00b2) +k y\u00b3= y - y\u00b3(1 +k\u00b2 -k). To maximize this with respect to y. Take derivative: dS/dy=1 -3y\u00b2(1 +k\u00b2 -k). Set to zero: 1=3y\u00b2(1 +k\u00b2 -k). So y\u00b2=1/(3(1 +k\u00b2 -k)). Then S= y - y\u00b3(1 +k\u00b2 -k). Substitute y\u00b2=1/(3(1 +k\u00b2 -k)), so y=1/sqrt(3(1 +k\u00b2 -k)). Then S= [1/sqrt(3(1 +k\u00b2 -k))] - [1/(3(1 +k\u00b2 -k))]^(3/2) * (1 +k\u00b2 -k). Simplify:\n\nLet\u2019s denote A=1 +k\u00b2 -k. Then S= (1/sqrt(3A)) - (1/(3A))^(3/2) * A = (1/sqrt(3A)) - (1/(3A))^(3/2) * A = (1/sqrt(3A)) - (1/(3A))^(1/2) * (1/3) = (1/sqrt(3A)) - (1/(3A))^(1/2)/3.\n\nWait, this seems messy. Maybe there's a better approach. Alternatively, pick specific values for k. Let's try k=1. Then A=1 +1 -1=1. Then y\u00b2=1/(3*1)=1/3, so y=1/\u221a3. Then S= (1/\u221a3) - (1/3*1)^(3/2)*1=1/\u221a3 - (1/3)^(3/2)= approx 0.577 - 0.192=0.385. Same as before. Hmm. So even with three variables, the maximum seems similar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a different pattern. Suppose every term is the same except two consecutive terms. For example, most terms are zero, but two consecutive terms are non-zero. Wait, that's the two-variable case again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the maximum occurs when three consecutive terms are non-zero. Let's try a\u2081, a\u2082, a\u2083, a\u2084 non-zero. But this might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the maximum is achieved when all terms are arranged in a repeating pattern. But with 100 terms, it's hard to see.\n\nAlternatively, use H\u00f6lder's inequality. H\u00f6lder's inequality states that for sequences (a_i), (b_i), (c_i), we have sum a_i b_i c_i \u2264 ||a||_p ||b||_q ||c||_r, where 1/p +1/q +1/r=1. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, since each term in S is a product of a_k\u00b2 and a_{k+1}, which is like a_k * a_k * a_{k+1}. So maybe apply H\u00f6lder's inequality with exponents 3, 3, 3, since (1/3 +1/3 +1/3)=1. Then sum a_k\u00b2 a_{k+1} \u2264 (sum a_k^3)^{2/3} (sum a_{k+1}^3)^{1/3}. But I'm not sure if this helps. Alternatively, use Cauchy-Schwarz.\n\nWait, let's consider the sum S = sum_{k=1}^{100} a_k\u00b2 a_{k+1}. Let's think of this as sum_{k=1}^{100} a_k a_k a_{k+1}. Then by H\u00f6lder's inequality, sum_{k=1}^{100} a_k a_k a_{k+1} \u2264 (sum a_k^3)^{2/3} (sum a_{k+1}^3)^{1/3}. But since the sequences are cyclic, sum a_{k+1}^3 = sum a_k^3. So H\u00f6lder gives S \u2264 (sum a_k^3)^{2/3} (sum a_k^3)^{1/3} = sum a_k^3. But sum a_k^3 \u2264 sum a_k\u00b2, since |a_k| \u22641 (because sum a_k\u00b2=1, so each |a_k| \u22641). Wait, but sum a_k^3 \u2264 sum a_k\u00b2 because |a_k|^3 \u2264 |a_k|\u00b2 when |a_k| \u22641. So sum |a_k|^3 \u2264 sum |a_k|\u00b2 =1. Therefore, S \u2264 sum a_k^3 \u22641. But 1 is larger than 12/25, so this approach isn't tight enough.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use Cauchy-Schwarz on the sum S. Let's write S = sum_{k=1}^{100} a_k\u00b2 a_{k+1}. Let's consider this as the dot product of two vectors: (a_1\u00b2, a_2\u00b2, ..., a_100\u00b2) and (a_2, a_3, ..., a_1). Then by Cauchy-Schwarz, S \u2264 sqrt( (sum a_k^4) (sum a_{k+1}^2) ). But sum a_{k+1}^2 = sum a_k^2 =1. So S \u2264 sqrt( sum a_k^4 ). Now, sum a_k^4 \u2264 (sum a_k\u00b2)^2 =1, by Cauchy-Schwarz again (since sum a_k^4 \u2265 (sum a_k\u00b2)^2 /100 by Cauchy, but actually sum a_k^4 \u2264 sum a_k\u00b2 because a_k\u00b2 \u22641 (since sum a_k\u00b2=1, each a_k\u00b2 \u22641). Wait, if a_k\u00b2 \u22641, then a_k^4 \u2264a_k\u00b2. Therefore, sum a_k^4 \u2264 sum a_k\u00b2 =1. Therefore, S \u2264 sqrt(1) =1. Again, not tight enough.\n\nHmm. So these inequalities give S \u22641, but we need to show S <12/25\u22480.48. So there must be a better approach.\n\nWait, maybe consider the cyclic nature and use some kind of averaging or symmetry. Let's think of the sum S as a cyclic sum. Maybe use the fact that the terms can be paired or rearranged. Alternatively, use the AM-GM inequality on each term.\n\nFor each term a_k\u00b2 a_{k+1}, by AM-GM, we have a_k\u00b2 a_{k+1} \u2264 (2a_k\u00b2 + a_{k+1}) /",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about converting lugs to ligs using some given exchange rates. So, first, we have 7 ligs equal to 4 lags, and then 9 lags equal to 20 lugs. The question is asking how many ligs are equivalent to 80 lugs, and the answer should be 63. Hmm, let me figure out the steps here.\n\nFirst, I need to find a way to convert lugs to lags first, and then lags to ligs. Since the given rates are between ligs and lags, and then lags and lugs, maybe I can create conversion factors. Let's start with the given equations.\n\nWe know that 7 ligs = 4 lags. So, to convert ligs to lags, we can say that 1 lig = 4/7 lags. Similarly, 9 lags = 20 lugs, so 1 lag = 20/9 lugs. But we need to go from lugs to lags to ligs. So, starting with 80 lugs, how many lags is that?\n\nIf 1 lag is 20/9 lugs, then to find how many lags correspond to 80 lugs, we can set up a proportion. Let me think. If 9 lags = 20 lugs, then 1 lug = 9/20 lags. Wait, that might be easier. So, 1 lug = 9/20 lags. Therefore, 80 lugs would be 80 * (9/20) lags. Let's compute that: 80 divided by 20 is 4, so 4 * 9 = 36. So, 80 lugs equal 36 lags. Okay, that's the first step: 80 lugs = 36 lags.\n\nNow, we need to convert lags to ligs. The given rate is 7 ligs = 4 lags. So, 1 lag = 7/4 ligs. Therefore, 36 lags would be 36 * (7/4) ligs. Let's calculate that: 36 divided by 4 is 9, and 9 * 7 is 63. So, 36 lags equal 63 ligs. Therefore, 80 lugs equal 63 ligs. That checks out with the answer we needed to show.\n\nWait, but maybe there's another way to approach this using unit conversion factors. Let me verify. Starting with 80 lugs, multiply by the conversion factor from lugs to lags, then from lags to ligs.\n\nSo, 80 lugs * (9 lags / 20 lugs) = (80 * 9)/20 lags = (720)/20 = 36 lags. Then, 36 lags * (7 ligs /4 lags) = (36 *7)/4 ligs = 252/4 = 63 ligs. Yep, same result. So that's solid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using least common multiples? Wait, in the context provided, there was an LCM used for monetary units. But here, maybe not necessary. Let me check the context again. The context solution used LCM of 8,7,6 to get 168, then multiplied by the sum of different currencies. Hmm, perhaps that's a different problem structure. In our problem, it's more of a chain conversion: lugs to lags to ligs. So maybe LCM isn't directly applicable here. But the key is setting up the conversion factors correctly.\n\nAnother way to think about it: Let's find how many ligs per lug. Since 9 lags =20 lugs, then 1 lug =9/20 lags. Then, since 7 ligs=4 lags, 1 lag=7/4 ligs. So, 1 lug =9/20 lags *7/4 ligs per lag = (9*7)/(20*4) ligs = 63/80 ligs per lug. Therefore, 80 lugs would be 80 * (63/80) ligs =63 ligs. That's another way to see it. So, the conversion factor from lugs to ligs is 63/80, so multiplying 80 lugs by that gives 63 ligs. That's a neat way to combine the two conversion steps into one.\n\nSo, all methods lead to 63 ligs. Therefore, the answer is indeed 63. The key steps are converting lugs to lags first, then lags to ligs, making sure the units cancel appropriately. Alternatively, combining the conversion factors into a single step. Either way, the result is consistent.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo determine how many ligs are equivalent to 80 lugs, we need to bridge the conversion rates provided. Let\u2019s break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Convert lugs to lags**:  \n   We know that \\(9\\) lags \\(= 20\\) lugs. This means \\(1\\) lug \\(= \\frac{9}{20}\\) lags.  \n   For \\(80\\) lugs:  \n   \\[\n   80 \\, \\text{lugs} \\times \\frac{9 \\, \\text{lags}}{20 \\, \\text{lugs}} = \\frac{80 \\times 9}{20} = 36 \\, \\text{lags}.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Convert lags to ligs**:  \n   We also know \\(7\\) ligs \\(= 4\\) lags, so \\(1\\) lag \\(= \\frac{7}{4}\\) ligs.  \n   For \\(36\\) lags:  \n   \\[\n   36 \\, \\text{lags} \\times \\frac{7 \\, \\text{ligs}}{4 \\, \\text{lags}} = \\frac{36 \\times 7}{4} = 63 \\, \\text{ligs}.\n   \\]\n\n**Combining the steps**:  \nBy first converting lugs to lags and then lags to ligs, we find that \\(80\\) lugs correspond to \\(63\\) ligs. This aligns with the answer we aimed to show. The key is ensuring the units cancel appropriately at each step, maintaining consistency in the ratios.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  4 * 20\na b c : \u211d\nh\u2080 : 0 < a \u2227 0 < b \u2227 0 < c\nh\u2081 : 9 * b = 20 * c\nh\u2082 : 7 * a = 4 * b\nh\u2083 : b = 20 * c / 9\nh\u2084 h\u2085 : a = 4 * (20 * c / 9) / 7\n\u22a2 a = 80 * (c / (9 * 7))\nunsolved goals\na b c : \u211d\nh\u2080 : 0 < a \u2227 0 < b \u2227 0 < c\nh\u2081 : 9 * b = 20 * c\nh\u2082 : 7 * a = 4 * b\nh\u2083 : b = 20 * c / 9\nh\u2084 h\u2085 : a = 4 * (20 * c / 9) / 7\nh\u2086 : a = 80 * c / (9 * 7)\n\u22a2 a = c * (80 / 63)\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  4 * b\na b c : \u211d\nh\u2080 : 0 < a \u2227 0 < b \u2227 0 < c\nh\u2081 : 9 * b = 20 * c\nh\u2082 : 7 * a = 4 * b\nh\u2083 : b = 20 * c / 9\n\u22a2 a = 4 * (20 * c / 9) / 7\nunsolved goals\na b c : \u211d\nh\u2080 : 0 < a \u2227 0 < b \u2227 0 < c\nh\u2081 : 9 * b = 20 * c\nh\u2082 : 7 * a = 4 * b\nh\u2083 : b = 20 * c / 9\nh\u2084 : a = 4 * (20 * c / 9) / 7\n\u22a2 4 * (20 * c) = 80 * c\nunsolved goals\na b c : \u211d\nh\u2080 : 0 < a \u2227 0 < b \u2227 0 < c\nh\u2081 : 9 * b = 20 * c\nh\u2082 : 7 * a = 4 * b\nh\u2083 : b = 20 * c / 9\nh\u2084 : a = 4 * (20 * c / 9) / 7\nh\u2085 : a = 80 * c / (9 * 7)\n\u22a2 63 * (80 * c) = 80 * c * (9 * 7)\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  4 * b\na b c : \u211d\nh\u2080 : 0 < a \u2227 0 < b \u2227 0 < c\nh\u2081 : 9 * b = 20 * c\nh\u2082 : 7 * a = 4 * b\nh\u2083 : b = 20 * c / 9\n\u22a2 a = 4 * (20 * c / 9) / 7\nunsolved goals\na b c : \u211d\nh\u2080 : 0 < a \u2227 0 < b \u2227 0 < c\nh\u2081 : 9 * b = 20 * c\nh\u2082 : 7 * a = 4 * b\nh\u2083 : b = 20 * c / 9\nh\u2084 : a = 4 * (20 * c / 9) / 7\n\u22a2 4 * (20 * c) = 80 * c\nunsolved goals\na b c : \u211d\nh\u2080 : 0 < a \u2227 0 < b \u2227 0 < c\nh\u2081 : 9 * b = 20 * c\nh\u2082 : 7 * a = 4 * b\nh\u2083 : b = 20 * c / 9\nh\u2084 : a = 4 * (20 * c / 9) / 7\nh\u2085 : a = 80 * c / (9 * 7)\n\u22a2 63 * (80 * c) = 80 * c * (9 * 7)\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem: Prove that cos(\u03c0/7) - cos(2\u03c0/7) + cos(3\u03c0/7) equals 1/2. Hmm, trigonometric identities with angles that are multiples of \u03c0/7. That seems a bit tricky. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that sometimes sums of cosines with angles that are fractions of \u03c0 can be evaluated using complex exponentials or roots of unity. Maybe Euler's formula could help here. Let me recall Euler's formula: e^(i\u03b8) = cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8. So, perhaps expressing each cosine term in terms of exponentials might simplify things.\n\nBut before jumping into that, let me check if there are any known identities involving cosines of multiple angles. For example, maybe using sum-to-product formulas? Let's see. The problem has three terms: cos(\u03c0/7), -cos(2\u03c0/7), and cos(3\u03c0/7). The signs alternate: positive, negative, positive. That alternation might complicate sum-to-product, but maybe grouping terms could help.\n\nAlternatively, considering the sum S = cos(\u03c0/7) - cos(2\u03c0/7) + cos(3\u03c0/7). Let me compute each term numerically to get a sense. Let's approximate:\n\ncos(\u03c0/7) \u2248 cos(25.714\u00b0) \u2248 0.90097\n\ncos(2\u03c0/7) \u2248 cos(51.428\u00b0) \u2248 0.62349\n\ncos(3\u03c0/7) \u2248 cos(77.142\u00b0) \u2248 0.22252\n\nSo S \u2248 0.90097 - 0.62349 + 0.22252 \u2248 0.90097 - 0.62349 = 0.27748; then +0.22252 gives \u2248 0.5. Oh, that's exactly 1/2. So numerically, it checks out. But how to prove it?\n\nAnother approach: Maybe relate this sum to roots of certain equations. Since 7 is a prime, the seventh roots of unity might be involved. The seventh roots of unity are e^(2\u03c0ik/7) for k = 0 to 6. The real parts of these roots are cos(2\u03c0k/7). But our angles are \u03c0/7, 2\u03c0/7, 3\u03c0/7, which are different. Wait, \u03c0/7 is half of 2\u03c0/7. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using multiple-angle identities or solving a polynomial equation. Let me think. If we can express the sum in terms of known trigonometric identities, maybe we can manipulate it.\n\nWait, let's consider the sum S = cos(\u03c0/7) - cos(2\u03c0/7) + cos(3\u03c0/7). Let me note that 3\u03c0/7 is equal to \u03c0 - 4\u03c0/7. So cos(3\u03c0/7) = cos(\u03c0 - 4\u03c0/7) = -cos(4\u03c0/7). Therefore, the sum S can be rewritten as cos(\u03c0/7) - cos(2\u03c0/7) - cos(4\u03c0/7). So S = cos(\u03c0/7) - cos(2\u03c0/7) - cos(4\u03c0/7). Hmm, maybe that's helpful.\n\nNow, there's a known identity related to the sum of cosines of angles that are in arithmetic progression, but here the angles are \u03c0/7, 2\u03c0/7, 4\u03c0/7. Wait, those angles are multiples of \u03c0/7, but each is double the previous modulo 2\u03c0. For example, 2*(\u03c0/7) = 2\u03c0/7, 2*(2\u03c0/7) = 4\u03c0/7, 2*(4\u03c0/7) = 8\u03c0/7 = 8\u03c0/7 - 2\u03c0 = -6\u03c0/7, but maybe that's a different direction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the identity for sum of cosines with angles in geometric progression. Wait, but 1, 2, 4 modulo 7. Since 2^3 = 8 \u22611 mod7, so the cycle is 1,2,4,1,2,4... So maybe these angles correspond to a cyclic group under multiplication modulo 7. That might be a stretch, but perhaps there's a connection.\n\nAlternatively, consider that 1, 2, 4 are the quadratic residues modulo 7? Wait, quadratic residues modulo 7 are 1, 2, and 4. Yes, because 1^2=1, 2^2=4, 3^2=2, 4^2=2, 5^2=4, 6^2=1 mod7. So 1,2,4 are the quadratic residues. Maybe that's relevant? Not sure yet.\n\nAlternatively, think about the equation z^7 = 1. The roots are e^(2\u03c0ik/7) for k=0 to 6. The sum of all roots is zero. The real parts of the roots (excluding 1) sum to -1/2. Wait, the sum of cos(2\u03c0k/7) for k=1 to 6 is -1. So the average is -1/2. But our problem involves different angles: \u03c0/7, 2\u03c0/7, 3\u03c0/7. Wait, \u03c0/7 is half of 2\u03c0/7. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the identity that the sum of cos(k\u03c0/n) for certain k can be expressed in closed form. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let's consider the original sum S = cos(\u03c0/7) - cos(2\u03c0/7) + cos(3\u03c0/7). Let me try to manipulate this sum. Let's write all terms with positive signs first: cos(\u03c0/7) + cos(3\u03c0/7) - cos(2\u03c0/7). Maybe group the first two terms.\n\nUsing sum-to-product identity: cos A + cos B = 2 cos((A+B)/2) cos((A-B)/2). Let's apply this to cos(\u03c0/7) + cos(3\u03c0/7). Let A = \u03c0/7, B = 3\u03c0/7. Then (A+B)/2 = 4\u03c0/14 = 2\u03c0/7, and (B - A)/2 = 2\u03c0/14 = \u03c0/7. So cos(\u03c0/7) + cos(3\u03c0/7) = 2 cos(2\u03c0/7) cos(\u03c0/7). Therefore, S = 2 cos(2\u03c0/7) cos(\u03c0/7) - cos(2\u03c0/7) = cos(2\u03c0/7)(2 cos(\u03c0/7) - 1). Hmm, not sure if that helps. Let's compute 2 cos(\u03c0/7) - 1. Maybe express this in terms of another identity.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider multiplying both sides by 2 and see if that leads to a known identity. Let's see: 2S = 2cos(\u03c0/7) - 2cos(2\u03c0/7) + 2cos(3\u03c0/7). But I don't see an immediate connection.\n\nWait, another idea: Use the identity for cos A - cos B = -2 sin((A+B)/2) sin((A-B)/2). Let's see if that can be applied to the terms with the negative sign. For example, take the -cos(2\u03c0/7) term. Maybe pair it with another term. But the sum is cos(\u03c0/7) - cos(2\u03c0/7) + cos(3\u03c0/7). Let's group the first and third terms: cos(\u03c0/7) + cos(3\u03c0/7) = 2 cos(2\u03c0/7) cos(\u03c0/7) as before. Then subtract cos(2\u03c0/7). So S = 2 cos(2\u03c0/7) cos(\u03c0/7) - cos(2\u03c0/7) = cos(2\u03c0/7)(2 cos(\u03c0/7) - 1). Hmm, maybe we can relate 2 cos(\u03c0/7) - 1 to something else.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that 2 cos(\u03c0/7) - 1 is a term that might appear in a trigonometric identity. Let me recall that 2 cos \u03b8 - 1 = 2 cos \u03b8 - 1. Maybe express this in terms of another angle. Alternatively, perhaps use multiple-angle formulas. For example, using the identity for cos(3\u03b8) or something.\n\nWait, let's consider that 3*(\u03c0/7) = 3\u03c0/7, which is one of the angles in the sum. Maybe there's a connection. Let's recall that cos(3\u03b8) = 4 cos^3 \u03b8 - 3 cos \u03b8. Let me set \u03b8 = \u03c0/7. Then cos(3\u03c0/7) = 4 cos^3(\u03c0/7) - 3 cos(\u03c0/7). Hmm, that's an equation involving cos(3\u03c0/7) and cos(\u03c0/7). Maybe substitute this into the sum S.\n\nSo S = cos(\u03c0/7) - cos(2\u03c0/7) + [4 cos^3(\u03c0/7) - 3 cos(\u03c0/7)] = cos(\u03c0/7) - 3 cos(\u03c0/7) + 4 cos^3(\u03c0/7) - cos(2\u03c0/7) = -2 cos(\u03c0/7) + 4 cos^3(\u03c0/7) - cos(2\u03c0/7). Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe we can relate cos(2\u03c0/7) to cos(\u03c0/7) as well. For example, using double-angle formula: cos(2\u03b8) = 2 cos^2 \u03b8 - 1. Let \u03b8 = \u03c0/7. Then cos(2\u03c0/7) = 2 cos^2(\u03c0/7) - 1. Substitute that into the expression:\n\nS = -2 cos(\u03c0/7) + 4 cos^3(\u03c0/7) - [2 cos^2(\u03c0/7) - 1] = -2 cos(\u03c0/7) + 4 cos^3(\u03c0/7) - 2 cos^2(\u03c0/7) + 1. So S = 4 cos^3(\u03c0/7) - 2 cos^2(\u03c0/7) - 2 cos(\u03c0/7) + 1. Hmm, this is a cubic in cos(\u03c0/7). Maybe if we can find a root or factor this expression.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a polynomial equation that cos(\u03c0/7) satisfies. Let me recall that cos(\u03c0/7) is a root of the equation 8x^3 - 4x^2 - 4x + 1 = 0. Let me check that. Let \u03b8 = \u03c0/7. Then 7\u03b8 = \u03c0. So 3\u03b8 = \u03c0 - 4\u03b8. Therefore, cos(3\u03b8) = cos(\u03c0 - 4\u03b8) = -cos(4\u03b8). Using the identity for cos(3\u03b8) and cos(4\u03b8):\n\ncos(3\u03b8) = 4 cos^3 \u03b8 - 3 cos \u03b8\n\ncos(4\u03b8) = 8 cos^4 \u03b8 - 8 cos^2 \u03b8 + 1\n\nBut since cos(3\u03b8) = -cos(4\u03b8), we have:\n\n4 cos^3 \u03b8 - 3 cos \u03b8 = - (8 cos^4 \u03b8 - 8 cos^2 \u03b8 + 1)\n\nRearranging:\n\n8 cos^4 \u03b8 + 4 cos^3 \u03b8 - 8 cos^2 \u03b8 - 3 cos \u03b8 + 1 = 0\n\nLet x = cos \u03b8. Then:\n\n8x^4 + 4x^3 - 8x^2 - 3x + 1 = 0\n\nHmm, but this is a quartic equation. Maybe factor it. Let's try to factor:\n\nLooking for rational roots using Rational Root Theorem. Possible roots are \u00b11, \u00b11/2, \u00b11/4, \u00b11/8.\n\nTesting x=1: 8 +4 -8 -3 +1=2\u22600\n\nx=-1: 8 -4 -8 +3 +1=0. So x=-1 is a root. Therefore, factor (x +1):\n\nDivide polynomial by (x +1):\n\nUsing synthetic division:\n\n-1 | 8  4  -8  -3  1\n\n          -8   4   4  -1\n\n      8  -4  -4   1   0\n\nSo quotient is 8x^3 -4x^2 -4x +1. Therefore, the quartic factors as (x +1)(8x^3 -4x^2 -4x +1)=0. Since cos(\u03c0/7) is not -1, it must satisfy the cubic equation 8x^3 -4x^2 -4x +1=0. So yes, cos(\u03c0/7) is a root of 8x^3 -4x^2 -4x +1=0.\n\nTherefore, 8x^3 -4x^2 -4x +1=0 where x = cos(\u03c0/7). Let's denote x = cos(\u03c0/7). Then 8x^3 -4x^2 -4x +1=0. Let's see if we can use this to simplify the expression for S.\n\nEarlier, we had S = 4x^3 -2x^2 -2x +1. Let's see if this can be related to the cubic equation. From the cubic equation: 8x^3 =4x^2 +4x -1. Therefore, 4x^3 =2x^2 +2x -0.5. Substitute into S:\n\nS = (4x^3) -2x^2 -2x +1 = (2x^2 +2x -0.5) -2x^2 -2x +1 = (-0.5) +1 = 0.5. So S = 1/2. That's exactly what we needed to prove!\n\nWait, that's brilliant! Let me recap. By expressing S in terms of x = cos(\u03c0/7), we found that S simplifies to 1/2 using the cubic equation that x satisfies. So the key steps were:\n\n1. Express S in terms of x = cos(\u03c0/7), using trigonometric identities to relate cos(3\u03c0/7) and cos(2\u03c0/7) to x.\n\n2. Substitute the cubic equation that x satisfies to simplify the expression for S.\n\nTherefore, the proof hinges on knowing that cos(\u03c0/7) satisfies a particular cubic equation, which can be derived from trigonometric identities involving multiple angles. Once we have that cubic equation, substituting it into the expression for S allows us to simplify and obtain the desired result.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't recall the cubic equation, I could derive it by using the relationship between cos(3\u03b8) and cos(4\u03b8) when \u03b8 = \u03c0/7, as shown earlier. This gives the necessary equation to substitute back into S.\n\nSo the main steps are:\n\n- Recognize that cos(3\u03c0/7) can be expressed in terms of cos(\u03c0/7) using the triple-angle identity.\n\n- Express cos(2\u03c0/7) using the double-angle identity in terms of cos(\u03c0/7).\n\n- Substitute these into the original sum S to express S as a polynomial in cos(\u03c0/7).\n\n- Use the cubic equation that cos(\u03c0/7) satisfies to simplify the polynomial expression, leading to S = 1/2.\n\nThis seems like a solid approach. Let me verify each step again to ensure there are no errors.\n\nFirst, cos(3\u03c0/7) = cos(3\u03b8) where \u03b8 = \u03c0/7. Using the triple-angle formula: cos(3\u03b8) = 4cos^3\u03b8 - 3cos\u03b8. Correct.\n\nThen, cos(2\u03c0/7) = 2cos^2\u03b8 - 1. Correct.\n\nSubstituting into S:\n\nS = cos\u03b8 - (2cos^2\u03b8 -1) + (4cos^3\u03b8 -3cos\u03b8)\n\n= cos\u03b8 -2cos^2\u03b8 +1 +4cos^3\u03b8 -3cos\u03b8\n\n= (cos\u03b8 -3cos\u03b8) + (-2cos^2\u03b8) +4cos^3\u03b8 +1\n\n= -2cos\u03b8 -2cos^2\u03b8 +4cos^3\u03b8 +1\n\n= 4cos^3\u03b8 -2cos^2\u03b8 -2cos\u03b8 +1\n\nThen, using the cubic equation 8cos^3\u03b8 -4cos^2\u03b8 -4cos\u03b8 +1=0, we can solve for 4cos^3\u03b8:\n\n8cos^3\u03b8 =4cos^2\u03b8 +4cos\u03b8 -1\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n4cos^3\u03b8 =2cos^2\u03b8 +2cos\u03b8 -0.5\n\nSubstitute into S:\n\nS = (2cos^2\u03b8 +2cos\u03b8 -0.5) -2cos^2\u03b8 -2cos\u03b8 +1\n\n= (2cos^2\u03b8 -2cos^2\u03b8) + (2cos\u03b8 -2cos\u03b8) + (-0.5 +1)\n\n= 0 +0 +0.5 =0.5\n\nYes, that works out perfectly. Therefore, S =1/2 as required.\n\nSo the key insight was recognizing that the cubic equation satisfied by cos(\u03c0/7) allows us to simplify the expression for S. This approach connects the problem to the algebraic properties of cosine of angles related to \u03c0/7, leveraging polynomial equations derived from trigonometric identities.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo prove that \\(\\cos{\\frac{\\pi}{7}} - \\cos{\\frac{2\\pi}{7}} + \\cos{\\frac{3\\pi}{7}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\), we start by leveraging trigonometric identities and algebraic properties of cosine at specific angles.

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have three distinct digits A, B, and C from 1 to 9. They need to satisfy three equations:\n\n1. A + B = C\n2. AA - B = 2 \u00d7 C\n3. C \u00d7 B = AA + A\n\nAnd we need to show that A + B + C equals 8.\n\nFirst, let's parse what each equation means. The first one is straightforward: the sum of A and B is C. Since they are digits from 1 to 9 and distinct, C must be at least 1 + 2 = 3 and at most 8 + 9 = 17, but since C is a single digit, C can only be from 3 to 9. But wait, A and B are single digits, so their sum C can't exceed 9 + 8 = 17, but since C itself is a single digit, the maximum possible sum is 9 + 8 = 17, but C has to be a single digit, so actually, the maximum possible C is 9. So A + B must be a single digit, meaning A + B \u2264 9. Therefore, C is between 3 and 9 inclusive.\n\nNext, the second equation: AA is a two-digit number, both digits A. So AA is 11*A. For example, if A is 3, AA is 33. Then AA minus B equals twice C. So 11A - B = 2C.\n\nThird equation: C multiplied by B equals AA plus A. Since AA is 11A, adding another A gives 12A. So C \u00d7 B = 12A.\n\nSo let's summarize the equations:\n\n1. A + B = C\n2. 11A - B = 2C\n3. C \u00d7 B = 12A\n\nWe need to find A, B, C (distinct digits 1-9) satisfying these, then sum them to get 8.\n\nLet me try substituting C from the first equation into the others. From equation 1, C = A + B. Substitute into equation 2:\n\n11A - B = 2(A + B)\n11A - B = 2A + 2B\n11A - 2A = 2B + B\n9A = 3B\nSo 3A = B.\n\nSo B is three times A. But since A and B are digits from 1 to 9, A can be 1, 2, or 3 (since 3\u00d73=9, which is valid). Let's check possible A values:\n\nCase 1: A = 1\nThen B = 3\u00d71 = 3\nThen C = 1 + 3 = 4\nCheck equation 3: C \u00d7 B = 4 \u00d7 3 = 12. AA + A = 11\u00d71 + 1 = 12. So 12 = 12. That works. Now check if all digits are distinct: A=1, B=3, C=4. All distinct. So this is a possible solution. Then A+B+C=1+3+4=8. So that's the answer. But wait, let's check other possible A values to ensure there are no other solutions.\n\nCase 2: A = 2\nThen B = 3\u00d72 = 6\nC = 2 + 6 = 8\nCheck equation 3: C \u00d7 B = 8 \u00d7 6 = 48. AA + A = 22 + 2 = 24. 48 \u2260 24. Doesn't work.\n\nCase 3: A = 3\nThen B = 3\u00d73 = 9\nC = 3 + 9 = 12. But C must be a single digit, so this is invalid.\n\nSo only A=1 gives a valid solution. Therefore, A=1, B=3, C=4, sum is 8.\n\nWait, but the problem says to \"show that it is 8\", implying that this is the only solution. Let me confirm there are no other possibilities. Did I miss any cases?\n\nWait, in the substitution, we assumed that B = 3A from equation 2. But what if there's another way? Let me check the steps again.\n\nFrom equation 1: C = A + B.\n\nEquation 2: 11A - B = 2C. Substitute C:\n\n11A - B = 2(A + B)\n11A - B = 2A + 2B\n11A - 2A = 2B + B\n9A = 3B\n3A = B. So that's correct. So B must be three times A, so A can only be 1, 2, or 3 as above. So those are the only possibilities. Then equation 3 must hold. Only A=1 works here. So that's the only solution.\n\nTherefore, the sum A+B+C is 1+3+4=8.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nLet's break down the problem step by step. We need to find three distinct digits \\( A \\), \\( B \\), and \\( C \\) (from 1 to 9) that satisfy three equations:\n\n1. \\( A + B = C \\)\n2. \\( AA - B = 2C \\) (where \\( AA \\) is the two-digit number formed by repeating \\( A \\), e.g., \\( 11 \\) if \\( A = 1 \\))\n3. \\( C \\times B = AA + A \\)\n\n**Step 1: Simplify the equations**  \nFirst, note that \\( AA \\) represents \\( 11A \\) (since \\( AA = 10A + A = 11A \\)). Rewrite the equations using this:  \n- Equation 2 becomes \\( 11A - B = 2C \\).  \n- Equation 3 becomes \\( C \\times B = 11A + A = 12A \\).\n\n**Step 2: Substitute \\( C \\) from Equation 1 into Equation 2**  \nFrom \\( C = A + B \\), substitute into Equation 2:  \n\\[\n11A - B = 2(A + B) \\implies 11A - B = 2A + 2B \\implies 9A = 3B \\implies 3A = B.\n\\]  \nThis tells us \\( B \\) must be exactly three times \\( A \\). Since \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are single digits, \\( A \\) can only be 1, 2, or 3 (because \\( 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\), the maximum valid digit).\n\n**Step 3: Test possible values for \\( A \\)**  \n- **Case 1: \\( A = 1 \\)**  \n  Then \\( B = 3 \\times 1 = 3 \\), and \\( C = 1 + 3 = 4 \\).  \n  Check Equation 3: \\( C \\times B = 4 \\times 3 = 12 \\), and \\( 12A = 12 \\times 1 = 12 \\). This works.  \n  All digits \\( 1, 3, 4 \\) are distinct.  \n\n- **Case 2: \\( A = 2 \\)**  \n  Then \\( B = 3 \\times 2 = 6 \\), and \\( C = 2 + 6 = 8 \\).  \n  Check Equation 3: \\( C \\times B = 8 \\times 6 = 48 \\), but \\( 12A = 12 \\times 2 = 24 \\). These don\u2019t match.  \n\n- **Case 3: \\( A = 3 \\)**  \n  Then \\( B = 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\), and \\( C = 3 + 9 = 12 \\).  \n  This fails because \\( C \\) must be a single digit.  \n\n**Step 4: Verify uniqueness**  \nOnly \\( A = 1 \\), \\( B = 3 \\), \\( C = 4 \\) satisfies all conditions. Their sum is \\( 1 + 3 + 4 = 8 \\). No other combinations work, confirming that \\( A + B + C = 8 \\) is the unique solution.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown tactic\nfailed to synthesize\n  LE \u2115\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  LE \u2115\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  LE \u2115\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  LE \u2115\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  LE \u2115\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  LE \u2115\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  HAdd \u2115 \u2115 ?m.150\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  HMul \u2115 \u2115 ?m.356\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  HAdd \u2115 \u2115 ?m.395\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  OfNat \u2115 1\nnumerals are polymorphic in Lean, but the numeral `1` cannot be used in a context where the expected type is\n  \u2115\ndue to the absence of the instance above\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  OfNat \u2115 9\nnumerals are polymorphic in Lean, but the numeral `9` cannot be used in a context where the expected type is\n  \u2115\ndue to the absence of the instance above\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  OfNat \u2115 1\nnumerals are polymorphic in Lean, but the numeral `1` cannot be used in a context where the expected type is\n  \u2115\ndue to the absence of the instance above\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  OfNat \u2115 9\nnumerals are polymorphic in Lean, but the numeral `9` cannot be used in a context where the expected type is\n  \u2115\ndue to the absence of the instance above\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  OfNat \u2115 1\nnumerals are polymorphic in Lean, but the numeral `1` cannot be used in a context where the expected type is\n  \u2115\ndue to the absence of the instance above\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  OfNat \u2115 9\nnumerals are polymorphic in Lean, but the numeral `9` cannot be used in a context where the expected type is\n  \u2115\ndue to the absence of the instance above\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  HMul Nat \u2115 ?m.245\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  HMul Nat \u2115 ?m.284\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nunsolved goals\n\u2115 : Type u_1\na b c : \u2115\nh\u2080 h\u2081 h\u2082 : sorryAx Prop true \u2227 sorryAx Prop true\nh\u2083 : a \u2260 b\nh\u2084 : a \u2260 c\nh\u2085 : b \u2260 c\nh\u2086 : sorryAx (Sort u_2) true\nh\u2087 : 10 * a + a -

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have four people: Anna, Bertram, Carli, and David, each with their own times for holding their breath. The problem gives us several equations based on their combined times and some multiples, and we need to find David's time as a simplified fraction and then sum the numerator and denominator. The answer should be 28. Let me see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's parse the given information. There are four variables here: Anna's time (let's call that A), Bertram's (B), Carli's (C), and David's (D). The problem gives us four equations, which should allow us to solve for all four variables. Let me write them out as equations.\n\n1. Bertram + Carli + David = 3 times Anna's time. So, B + C + D = 3A.\n2. Anna + Carli + David = 4 times Bertram's time. So, A + C + D = 4B.\n3. Anna + Bertram + David = 2 times Carli's time. So, A + B + D = 2C.\n4. 8A + 10B + 6C = two fifths of an hour. Since an hour is 60 minutes, two fifths is 24 minutes. So, 8A + 10B + 6C = 24.\n\nOur goal is to find D, and then compute numerator + denominator when D is expressed as a simplified fraction. The answer is supposed to be 28, so we need to check that.\n\nLet me start by writing all four equations:\n\n1. B + C + D = 3A  \u2192 Equation (1)\n2. A + C + D = 4B  \u2192 Equation (2)\n3. A + B + D = 2C  \u2192 Equation (3)\n4. 8A + 10B + 6C = 24 \u2192 Equation (4)\n\nNow, we have four equations with four variables. Let's see how to solve this system. Since all equations except the fourth are linear in A, B, C, D, maybe we can express D in terms of A, B, C from the first three equations and substitute into each other to find relations between A, B, C, then use equation (4) to solve for them.\n\nLet me try to express D from each of the first three equations:\n\nFrom Equation (1): D = 3A - B - C \u2192 Equation (1a)\n\nFrom Equation (2): D = 4B - A - C \u2192 Equation (2a)\n\nFrom Equation (3): D = 2C - A - B \u2192 Equation (3a)\n\nNow, since all three expressions equal D, we can set them equal to each other. Let's set Equation (1a) equal to Equation (2a):\n\n3A - B - C = 4B - A - C\n\nSimplify both sides. Let's add A and B and C to both sides to eliminate some terms:\n\n3A - B - C + A + C = 4B - A - C + A + C\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n4A - B = 4B\n\nThen, 4A = 5B \u2192 A = (5/4)B \u2192 Equation (5)\n\nSimilarly, set Equation (1a) equal to Equation (3a):\n\n3A - B - C = 2C - A - B\n\nSimplify. Let's add A + B to both sides:\n\n3A - B - C + A + B = 2C - A - B + A + B\n\nWhich gives:\n\n4A - C = 2C\n\nSo, 4A = 3C \u2192 C = (4/3)A \u2192 Equation (6)\n\nBut from Equation (5), A = (5/4)B. Substitute that into Equation (6):\n\nC = (4/3)*(5/4)B = (5/3)B \u2192 C = (5/3)B \u2192 Equation (7)\n\nNow, we have A and C in terms of B. Let's express everything in terms of B. Then, we can substitute into Equation (4) to solve for B.\n\nFrom Equation (5): A = (5/4)B\n\nFrom Equation (7): C = (5/3)B\n\nNow, let's substitute A and C into Equation (4):\n\n8A + 10B + 6C = 24\n\nSubstituting A and C:\n\n8*(5/4)B + 10B + 6*(5/3)B = 24\n\nCalculate each term:\n\n8*(5/4)B = (8/4)*5B = 2*5B = 10B\n\n10B remains as is.\n\n6*(5/3)B = (6/3)*5B = 2*5B = 10B\n\nSo, adding them up:\n\n10B + 10B + 10B = 30B = 24\n\nTherefore, 30B = 24 \u2192 B = 24/30 = 4/5.\n\nSo, B = 4/5 minutes.\n\nNow, find A and C using Equations (5) and (7):\n\nA = (5/4)B = (5/4)*(4/5) = 1. So, A = 1 minute.\n\nC = (5/3)B = (5/3)*(4/5) = (4/3) minutes. So, C = 4/3 minutes.\n\nNow, we need to find D. Let's use one of the expressions for D. Let's use Equation (1a):\n\nD = 3A - B - C\n\nSubstitute A = 1, B = 4/5, C = 4/3:\n\nD = 3*1 - 4/5 - 4/3\n\nCompute:\n\n3 = 3/1\n\nConvert all to fifteenths to subtract:\n\n3 = 45/15\n\n4/5 = 12/15\n\n4/3 = 20/15\n\nSo, D = 45/15 - 12/15 - 20/15 = (45 - 12 - 20)/15 = 13/15.\n\nSo, D = 13/15 minutes. The simplified fraction is 13/15. The numerator is 13, denominator is 15. Their sum is 13 + 15 = 28, which matches the problem's assertion.\n\nWait, let me check all steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, equations:\n\n1. B + C + D = 3A\n\n2. A + C + D = 4B\n\n3. A + B + D = 2C\n\n4. 8A + 10B + 6C = 24\n\nExpressed D from each:\n\nFrom (1): D = 3A - B - C\n\nFrom (2): D = 4B - A - C\n\nSet equal: 3A - B - C = 4B - A - C \u2192 3A - B = 4B - A \u2192 4A = 5B \u2192 A = (5/4)B. Correct.\n\nFrom (1) and (3):\n\n3A - B - C = 2C - A - B \u2192 3A - C = 2C - A \u2192 4A = 3C \u2192 C = (4/3)A. Then substituting A = (5/4)B gives C = (4/3)*(5/4)B = 5/3 B. Correct.\n\nThen substituting into equation (4):\n\n8A + 10B + 6C = 24\n\nA = 5/4 B, C = 5/3 B.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n8*(5/4 B) = 10B\n\n10B = 10B\n\n6*(5/3 B) = 10B\n\nTotal: 10B +10B +10B =30B=24 \u2192 B=24/30=4/5. Correct.\n\nThen A=5/4 *4/5=1. Correct.\n\nC=5/3 *4/5=4/3. Correct.\n\nThen D from equation (1a): 3A - B - C = 3*1 -4/5 -4/3.\n\nConvert to 15 denominator:\n\n3=45/15, 4/5=12/15, 4/3=20/15.\n\n45 -12 -20=13. So D=13/15. Correct.\n\nSum 13+15=28. All steps check out. So the answer is 28.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nLet's break down the problem step by step using the given conditions.

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to show that for any natural number n, 12 divides 4^(n+1) + 20. Hmm, let's start by understanding what this means. If 12 divides a number, that means the number is a multiple of 12. So, 4^(n+1) + 20 should be divisible by 12 for all natural numbers n.\n\nFirst, maybe I can try plugging in some small values of n to see if the pattern holds. Let's test n=1: 4^(1+1) + 20 = 16 + 20 = 36. 36 divided by 12 is 3, so that works. For n=2: 4^3 + 20 = 64 + 20 = 84. 84 divided by 12 is 7, which is also good. n=3: 256 + 20 = 276. 276 \u00f712 =23. Okay, so it works for these examples. But examples aren't proofs. I need a general approach.\n\nSince the problem is about divisibility by 12, maybe modular arithmetic would help here. If I can show that 4^(n+1) + 20 \u2261 0 mod 12 for all natural numbers n, then that would mean 12 divides it. Let's try that.\n\nFirst, let's simplify 4^(n+1) mod 12. 4^1 is 4 mod 12. 4^2 is 16 \u2261 4 mod 12. Wait, 16 mod 12 is 4. Then 4^3 would be 4*4=16 \u22614 mod12 again. So it seems like 4^k \u22614 mod12 for any k\u22651. If that's the case, then 4^(n+1) \u22614 mod12. Then adding 20 would give 4 +20=24\u22610 mod12. So 24 is divisible by 12. Wait, but this seems too straightforward. Let me check again.\n\nWait, 4^1=4 mod12. 4^2=16\u22614 mod12. 4^3=4*4=16\u22614 mod12. So yes, it's a pattern. So 4^(n+1) \u22614 mod12 for any n\u22650. Then 4^(n+1)+20\u22614+20=24\u22610 mod12. Therefore, it's divisible by 12. But wait, this seems too easy. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe induction would be a better approach. Let's try mathematical induction. For n=1, we already saw it's 36, which is divisible by 12. Assume it's true for some k\u22651, that 4^(k+1)+20 is divisible by 12. Then for n=k+1, we need to show 4^(k+2)+20 is divisible by 12. Let's compute 4^(k+2)+20 =4*4^(k+1)+20. From the induction hypothesis, 4^(k+1)+20=12m for some integer m. So 4^(k+1)=12m-20. Substitute back: 4*(12m-20)+20=48m-80+20=48m-60=12*(4m-5). Which is clearly divisible by 12. So by induction, it holds for all natural numbers n.\n\nWait, but the first approach using modular arithmetic seems valid too. Maybe both methods work. The induction approach is more formal, while the modular arithmetic is quicker. But since the problem asks for a proof, either method should be acceptable. However, the context provided earlier uses induction for a similar problem, so maybe induction is the expected approach here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to factor the expression. Let's see: 4^(n+1) +20 =4*4^n +20=4(4^n +5). Hmm, 4 times something. For this to be divisible by 12, the something (4^n +5) needs to be divisible by 3, since 4 and 12 share a factor of 4. So 4^n +5 \u22610 mod3. Let's check: 4\u22611 mod3, so 4^n\u22611^n=1 mod3. Then 1 +5=6\u22610 mod3. So yes, 4^n +5 is divisible by 3. Therefore, 4(4^n +5) is divisible by 4*3=12. That's another way to see it.\n\nSo, combining these observations: since 4^n \u22611 mod3, adding 5 gives 6\u22610 mod3, so 4^n +5 is divisible by 3, and multiplying by 4 gives divisibility by 12. This seems like a solid proof.\n\nBut perhaps the problem expects induction, given the context. Let me structure the proof using induction, as that's a common method for such statements.\n\nBase case: n=1, which we checked as 36, divisible by 12.\n\nInductive step: Assume for some k\u22651, 4^(k+1)+20 is divisible by 12. Then for k+1, 4^(k+2)+20=4*4^(k+1)+20. From the inductive hypothesis, 4^(k+1)+20=12m. So 4^(k+1)=12m-20. Substitute into the expression: 4*(12m-20)+20=48m-80+20=48m-60=12*(4m-5), which is divisible by 12. Hence, by induction, the statement holds for all natural numbers n.\n\nAlternatively, using modular arithmetic as the primary method: Observe that 4 \u22614 mod12, 4^2=16\u22614 mod12, and so on. So 4^n \u22614 mod12 for any n\u22651. Therefore, 4^(n+1)=4*4^n\u22614*4=16\u22614 mod12. Then 4^(n+1)+20\u22614+20=24\u22610 mod12. Hence, divisible by 12.\n\nBoth methods are valid, but the induction approach might be more aligned with the context provided, which used induction for the divisibility by 12 theorem. However, the modular arithmetic approach is more straightforward here. The problem might accept either, but to be thorough, perhaps present both ideas.\n\nBut since the user wants a clear informal proof, maybe the modular arithmetic approach is more concise and easier to follow. Let's go with that.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo show that 12 divides \\(4^{n+1} + 20\\) for any natural number \\(n\\), we can use modular arithmetic to simplify the expression modulo 12.

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is to show that if 2x\u00b2 = 4x + 9 and x is positive, then x can be written in the form (a + \u221ab)/c where a, b, c are positive integers, and that a + b + c equals 26. The user wants an informal proof explaining why this is the case.\n\nFirst, I need to solve the quadratic equation 2x\u00b2 = 4x + 9. Let me rearrange it to standard quadratic form. Subtract 4x and 9 from both sides: 2x\u00b2 - 4x - 9 = 0. That's the equation we need to solve.\n\nLooking at the context example, they divided by the coefficient of x\u00b2 to simplify. Maybe I should do the same here. The coefficient here is 2, so divide all terms by 2: x\u00b2 - 2x - 9/2 = 0. Hmm, but fractions might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe completing the square directly. Let's try that.\n\nStarting with 2x\u00b2 - 4x - 9 = 0. To complete the square, it's often easier if the coefficient of x\u00b2 is 1. So divide each term by 2: x\u00b2 - 2x - 9/2 = 0. Now, move the constant term to the other side: x\u00b2 - 2x = 9/2.\n\nTo complete the square for x\u00b2 - 2x, take half of the coefficient of x, which is -2/2 = -1. Square that: (-1)\u00b2 = 1. Add this to both sides: x\u00b2 - 2x + 1 = 9/2 + 1. Simplify the left side as (x - 1)\u00b2. On the right side, 9/2 + 1 is 9/2 + 2/2 = 11/2. So now we have (x - 1)\u00b2 = 11/2.\n\nTake square roots of both sides: x - 1 = \u00b1\u221a(11/2). Then add 1 to both sides: x = 1 \u00b1 \u221a(11/2). But since x is positive, we need to consider both solutions. The positive solution would be x = 1 + \u221a(11/2). However, the problem states that x is written as (a + \u221ab)/c where a, b, c are positive integers. The current form has \u221a(11/2), which can be rationalized to \u221a22 / \u221a4 = \u221a22 / 2. So, x = 1 + (\u221a22)/2. Combine the terms over a common denominator: x = (2 + \u221a22)/2. Now, this is in the form (a + \u221ab)/c where a=2, b=22, c=2. Adding them up: 2 + 22 + 2 = 26. That matches the required answer.\n\nWait, let me check if there's another way. Alternatively, using the quadratic formula. The original equation is 2x\u00b2 -4x -9 =0. Applying quadratic formula: x = [4 \u00b1 \u221a(16 + 72)]/(2*2). Wait, discriminant is 16 + 72? Let's compute discriminant D = (-4)^2 - 4*2*(-9) = 16 + 72 = 88. So sqrt(88) = 2*sqrt(22). Therefore, x = [4 \u00b1 2\u221a22]/4. Simplify numerator and denominator: divide numerator and denominator by 2: [2 \u00b1 \u221a22]/2. Since x is positive, take the positive root: [2 + \u221a22]/2. So again, a=2, b=22, c=2. Sum is 26. Yep, same result.\n\nSo both methods lead to the same conclusion. The key steps are rearranging the equation into standard quadratic form, then either completing the square or using the quadratic formula to solve for x. Then rationalizing or simplifying the expression to match the required form. The positive solution is chosen because x is given as a positive number.

Start by moving the constant term to the right:  \n\\[\nx^2 - 2x = \\frac{9}{2}.\n\\]  \nTo complete the square for \\(x^2 - 2x\\), take half the coefficient of \\(x\\) (which is \\(-1\\)), square it (\\(1\\)), and add it to both sides:  \n\\[\nx^2 - 2x + 1 = \\frac{9}{2} + 1 \\implies (x - 1)^2 = \\frac{11}{2}.\n\\]  \nTake the square root of both sides:  \n\\[\nx - 1 = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{11}{2}}.\n\\]  \nSince \\(x\\) is positive, we use the positive root:  \n\\[\nx = 1 + \\sqrt{\\frac{11}{2}}.\n\\]  \nTo rationalize \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{11}{2}}\\), rewrite it as \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{22}}{2}\\). Substituting back:  \n\\[\nx = 1 + \\frac{\\sqrt{22}}{2} = \\frac{2 + \\sqrt{22}}{2}.\n\\]  \nThis matches the form \\(\\frac{a + \\sqrt{b}}{c}\\) with \\(a = 2\\), \\(b = 22\\), and \\(c = 2\\). Adding these values:  \n\\[\na + b + c = 2 + 22 + 2 = 26.\n\\]  \nThus, the simplified form of \\(x\\) satisfies the given conditions, and the sum \\(a + b + c\\) is indeed **26**.\nPrevious attempt failed with: type mismatch\n  h\u2086\nhas type\n  -9 - \u2191a * 2 + \u2191a * \u221a\u2191b + (\u2191a ^ 2 * (1 / 2) - \u221a\u2191b * 2) + \u221a\u2191b ^ 2 * (1 / 2) = 0 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  (\u2191a + \u221a\u2191b) ^ 2 - 4 * (\u2191a + \u221a\u2191b) - 18 = 0 : Prop\ntype mismatch\n  h\u2087\nhas type\n  -18 - \u2191a * 4 + \u2191a * \u221a\u2191b * 2 + (\u2191a ^ 2 - \u221a\u2191b * 4) + \u221a\u2191b ^ 2 = 0 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u2191a ^ 2 + 2 * \u2191a * \u221a\u2191b + \u2191b - 4 * \u2191a - 4 * \u221a\u2191b - 18 = 0 : Prop\ntype mismatch\n  h\u2081\u2081\nhas type\n  2 + 22 + 2 = 26 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  a + b + c = 26 : Prop\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: expected token\nunsolved goals\nx : \u211d\na b c : \u2115\nh\u2080 : 0 < a \u2227 0 < b \u2227 0 < c \u2227 0 \u2264 x\nh\u2081 : 2 * x ^ 2 = 4 * x + 9\nh\u2082 : x = (\u2191a + \u221a\u2191b) / \u2191c\nh\u2083 : c = 2\nh\u2084 : 2 * x ^ 2 - 4 * x - 9 = 0\n\u22a2 (x ^ 2 - 2 * x) * 2 - 9 = 0\nunsolved goals\ncase h\u2087\nx : \u211d\na b c : \u2115\nh\u2080 : 0 < a \u2227 0 < b \u2227 0 < c \u2227 0 \u2264 x\nh\u2081 : 2 * x ^ 2 = 4 * x + 9\nh\u2082 : x = (\u2191a + \u221a\u2191b) / \u2191c\nh\u2083 : c = 2\nh\u2084 : 2 * x ^ 2 - 4 * x - 9 = 0\nh\u2085 : x ^ 2 - 2 * x - 9 / 2 = 0\nh\u2086 : (x - 1) ^ 2 = 11 / 2\n\u22a2 x - 1 = sorryAx \u211d true\n\nx : \u211d\na b c : \u2115\nh\u2080 : 0 < a \u2227 0 < b \u2227 0 < c \u2227 0 \u2264 x\nh\u2081 : 2 * x ^ 2 = 4 * x + 9\nh\u2082 : x = (\u2191a + \u221a\u2191b) / \u2191c\nh\u2083 : c = 2\nh\u2084 : 2 * x ^ 2 - 4 * x - 9 = 0\nh\u2085 : x ^ 2 - 2 * x - 9 / 2 = 0\nh\u2086 : (x - 1) ^ 2 = 11 / 2\nh\u2087 : x - 1 = sorryAx \u211d true\n\u22a2 a + b + c = 26\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unsolved goals\nx : \u211d\na b c : \u2115\nh\u2080 : 0 < a \u2227 0 < b \u2227 0 < c \u2227 0 \u2264 x\nh\u2081 : 2 * x ^ 2 = 4 * x + 9\nh\u2082 : x = (\u2191a + \u221a\u2191b) / \u2191c\nh\u2083 : c = 2\nh\u2084 : 2 * x ^ 2 - 4 * x - 9 = 0\n\u22a2 (x ^ 2 - 2 * x) * 2 - 9 = 0\ntype mismatch\n  h\u2086\nhas type\n  (x - 1) ^ 2 = 11 / 2 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  (x - 1) ^ 2 = \u221a(11 / 2) ^ 2 : Prop\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase inr.h1.h\nx : \u211d\na b c : \u2115\nh\u2080 : 0 < a \u2227 0 < b \u2227 0 < c \u2227 0 \u2264 x\nh\u2081 : 2 * x ^ 2 = 4 * x + 9\nh\u2082 : x = (\u2191a + \u221a\u2191b) / \u2191c\nh\u2083 : c = 2\nh\u2084 : 2 * x ^ 2 - 4 * x - 9 = 0\nh\u2085 : x ^ 2 - 2 * x - 9 / 2 = 0\nh\u2086 : (x - 1) ^ 2 = 11 / 2\nh\u2087 : x - 1 = -\u221a(11 / 2)\na\u271d : x < 1 + \u221a(11 / 2)\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nunsolved goals\nx : \u211d\na b c : \u2115\nh\u2080 : 0 < a \u2227 0 < b \u2227 0 < c \u2227 0 \u2264 x\nh\u2081 : 2 * x ^ 2 = 4 * x + 9\nh\u2082 : x = (\u2191a + \u221a\u2191b) / \u2191c\nh\u2083 : c = 2\nh\u2084 : 2 * x ^ 2 - 4 * x - 9 = 0\nh\u2085 : x ^ 2 - 2 * x - 9 / 2 = 0\nh\u2086 : (x - 1) ^ 2 = 11 / 2\nh\u2087 : x - 1 = \u221a(11 / 2) \u2228 x - 1 = -\u221a(11 / 2)\nh\u2088 : x = 1 + \u221a(11 / 2)\n\u22a2 \u221a2 * 2 + \u221a11 * 2 = \u221a2 * 2 + \u221a2 * \u221a22\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase h1.h\nx : \u211d\na b c : \u2115\nh\u2080 : 0 < a \u2227 0 < b \u2227 0 < c \u2227 0 \u2264 x\nh\u2081 : 2 * x ^ 2 = 4 * x + 9\nh\u2082 : x = (\u2191a + \u221a\u2191b) / \u2191c\nh\u2083 : c = 2\nh\u2084 : 2 * x ^ 2 - 4 * x - 9 = 0\nh\u2085 : x ^ 2 - 2 * x - 9 / 2 = 0\nh\u2086 : (x - 1) ^ 2 = 11 / 2\nh\u2087 : x - 1 = \u221a(11 / 2) \u2228 x - 1 = -\u221a(11 / 2)\nh\u2088 : x = 1 + \u221a(11 / 2)\nh\u2089 : (\u2191a + \u221a\u2191b) / 2 = (2 + \u221a22) / 2\na\u271d : a < 2\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase h1.h\nx : \u211d\na b c : \u2115\nh\u2080 : 0 < a \u2227 0 < b \u2227 0 < c \u2227 0 \u2264 x\nh\u2081 : 2 * x ^ 2 = 4 * x + 9\nh\u2082 : x = (\u2191a + \u221a\u2191b) / \u2191c\nh\u2083 : c = 2\nh\u2084 : 2 * x ^ 2 - 4 * x - 9 = 0\nh\u2085 : x ^ 2 - 2 * x - 9 / 2 = 0\nh\u2086 : (x - 1) ^ 2 = 11 / 2\nh\u2087 : x - 1 = \u221a(11 / 2) \u2228 x - 1 = -\u221a(11 / 2)\nh\u2088 : x = 1 + \u221a(11 / 2)\nh\u2089 : (\u2191a + \u221a\u2191b) / 2 = (2 + \u221a22) / 2\na\u271d : b < 22\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nno goals to be solved\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding last year's enrollment at Liberty Middle School, given that this year's enrollment is 598 students, which is a 4% increase from last year. We need to show that last year's enrollment was 575 students.\n\nHmm, percentage increase problems can sometimes be tricky because you have to remember whether the percentage is applied to the original or the new value. In this case, a 4% increase over last year's enrollment means that this year's enrollment is 104% of last year's. So, if last year's enrollment is the base, then this year's is that base plus 4% of it. \n\nLet me think. Let's denote last year's enrollment as some number, say, x. Then, a 4% increase would mean x multiplied by 1.04, right? Because 4% is 0.04, and adding that to 1 gives 1.04. So, the equation would be x * 1.04 = 598. To find x, we need to divide 598 by 1.04. \n\nWait, but the answer is supposed to be 575. Let me check that. If I take 575 and multiply by 1.04, does it equal 598? Let's calculate 575 * 1.04. 575 times 1 is 575, and 575 times 0.04 is 23. So 575 + 23 is 598. Yes, that works. So dividing 598 by 1.04 gives 575. \n\nBut maybe I should explain this step by step. The key idea is that when you have a percentage increase, the new amount is the original plus the percentage of the original. So, mathematically, new = original + (original * percentage). Factoring out the original, that's original * (1 + percentage). In this case, 4% is 0.04, so 1 + 0.04 = 1.04. Therefore, new enrollment is original * 1.04. \n\nSo solving for original, we divide the new enrollment by 1.04. 598 divided by 1.04. Let me do that division. 598 \u00f7 1.04. To make it easier, maybe multiply numerator and denominator by 100 to eliminate decimals. So 59800 \u00f7 104. Let's see, 104 times 575 is 59800. Because 104*500=52,000 and 104*75=7,800. Adding those gives 59,800. So yes, 59800 \u00f7 104 = 575. Therefore, last year's enrollment was 575 students. \n\nAlternatively, maybe someone might think to take 4% of 598 and subtract it, but that's a common mistake. Because the 4% increase is based on last year's number, not this year's. So if you take 4% of 598 and subtract, you'd get a different number. For example, 4% of 598 is 23.92, subtracting that from 598 gives 574.08, which isn't 575. So that approach is wrong. Hence, the correct method is to divide by 1.04 instead of subtracting a percentage of the new value. \n\nTherefore, the proof shows that starting with 575, increasing by 4% gives 598, confirming that last year's enrollment was indeed 575.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo determine last year's enrollment, we start by recognizing that a 4% increase means this year's enrollment (598 students) equals 104% of last year's total. Let\u2019s denote last year\u2019s enrollment as \\( x \\). \n\nThe relationship can be written as:\n\\[\nx \\times 1.04 = 598\n\\]\nTo isolate \\( x \\), divide both sides by 1.04:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{598}{1.04}\n\\]\nSimplifying this division gives \\( x = 575 \\). \n\n**Verification:**  \nIf last year\u2019s enrollment was 575, a 4% increase would be:\n\\[\n575 + (0.04 \\times 575) = 575 + 23 = 598\n\\]\nThis matches the given enrollment after redistricting, confirming that last year\u2019s enrollment was indeed **575 students**. The key insight is that percentage increases are calculated relative to the original value, not the new value.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  OfScientific \u2115\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase h1.h\nx : \u2115\nh\u2080 : \u2191x + 4 / 100 * \u2191x = 598\nh\u2081 : 104 / 100 * \u2191x = 598\na\u271d : 1.04 * x < 598\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nfailed to synthesize\n  OfScientific \u2115\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase h1.h\nx : \u2115\nh\u2080 : \u2191x + 4 / 100 * \u2191x = 598\nh\u2081 : 104 / 100 * \u2191x = 598\na\u271d : x < 598 / 1.04\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nunknown identifier 'h\u2083'\ntype mismatch\n  h\u2084\nhas type\n  x = 575 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  OfScientific \u2115 : Type\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: linarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase h1.h\nx : \u2115\nh\u2080 : \u2191x + 4 / 100 * \u2191x = 598\nh\u2081 : 104 / 100 * \u2191x = 598\na\u271d : 1.04 * \u2191x < 598\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nfailed to synthesize\n  OfScientific \u2115\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase h1.h\nx : \u2115\nh\u2080 : \u2191x + 4 / 100 * \u2191x = 598\nh\u2081 : 104 / 100 * \u2191x = 598\nh\u2082 : 1.04 * \u2191x = 598\na\u271d : x < 598 / 1.04\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nunknown identifier 'h\u2083'\ntype mismatch\n  h\u2084\nhas type\n  x = 575 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  OfScientific \u2115 : Type\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: linarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase h1.h\nx : \u2115\nh\u2080 : \u2191x + 4 / 100 * \u2191x = 598\nh\u2081 : 104 / 100 * \u2191x = 598\na\u271d : 1.04 * \u2191x < 598\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nfailed to synthesize\n  OfScientific \u2115\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase h1.h\nx : \u2115\nh\u2080 : \u2191x + 4 / 100 * \u2191x = 598\nh\u2081 : 104 / 100 * \u2191x = 598\nh\u2082 : 1.04 * \u2191x = 598\na\u271d : x < 598 / 1.04\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nunknown identifier 'h\u2083'\ntype mismatch\n  h\u2084\nhas type\n  x = 575 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  OfScientific \u2115 : Type\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem: Show that if x and y are positive integers such that x^(y\u00b2) = y^x, then the only solutions are (1,1), (16,2), and (27,3). Hmm, interesting. So we need to find all pairs (x,y) where this equation holds. Let me start by thinking about small values and see if I can spot a pattern or figure out a way to approach it.\n\nFirst, let's check the obvious ones. If x = y, then the equation becomes x^(x\u00b2) = x^x. Simplifying both sides, x^(x\u00b2) = x^x implies that x\u00b2 = x, which means x\u00b2 - x = 0 \u2192 x(x-1) = 0. Since x is a positive integer, the solutions here are x=1. So (1,1) is a solution. That's one down.\n\nNow, let's consider cases where x \u2260 y. Let's try small values of y first. Let's start with y=1. Then the equation becomes x^(1) = 1^x \u2192 x = 1. So (1,1) again. That's already covered.\n\nNext, y=2. Then the equation is x^4 = 2^x. Let's see for x=2: 2^4=16 vs 2^2=4 \u2192 16\u22604. x=4: 4^4=256 vs 2^4=16 \u2192 256\u226016. Wait, but wait, maybe x=16? Let's check: 16^4 = (2^4)^4 = 2^16, and 2^16 = 65536. On the other side, 2^16 = 65536. Wait, no, wait: 16^(2^2) = 16^4 = 65536, and y^x = 2^16 = 65536. Oh! So 16^4 = 2^16, which is true. So (16,2) is a solution. That's the second one.\n\nSimilarly, y=3. Then the equation is x^9 = 3^x. Let's try x=3: 3^9=19683 vs 3^3=27 \u2192 not equal. x=27: 27^9 vs 3^27. Wait, 27 is 3^3, so 27^9 = (3^3)^9 = 3^27. So 3^27 = 3^27. So (27,3) works. That's the third solution.\n\nNow, are there any other solutions? Let's check y=4. Then the equation is x^16 = 4^x. Let's see if there's an x that satisfies this. Let's try x=4: 4^16 vs 4^4 \u2192 4^16 is way bigger. x=2: 2^16=65536 vs 4^2=16 \u2192 nope. x=16: 16^16 vs 4^16. 16^16 = (4^2)^16 = 4^32, which is way bigger than 4^16. So no solution here.\n\nSimilarly, y=5: x^25 =5^x. Testing x=5: 5^25 vs 5^5 \u2192 no. x=25: 25^25 vs 5^25. 25^25 = (5^2)^25 =5^50, which is way bigger than 5^25. So no solution here.\n\nSo maybe the only solutions are the ones mentioned. But how do we prove that there are no others?\n\nLet's think about the equation x^(y\u00b2) = y^x. Taking natural logarithms on both sides: y\u00b2 ln x = x ln y. Rearranging, (ln x)/x = (ln y)/y\u00b2. Hmm, interesting. Let's consider the function f(a) = (ln a)/a. For a >0. The function f(a) increases up to a=e and then decreases. Similarly, for the right side, we have (ln y)/y\u00b2. Let's define g(y) = (ln y)/y\u00b2. Let's analyze these functions to see where they can intersect.\n\nWait, but here we have (ln x)/x = (ln y)/y\u00b2. So for given y, we can solve for x, but since x and y are integers, this might be tricky. Alternatively, maybe we can express x in terms of y or vice versa.\n\nSuppose that x and y are both greater than 1. Let's consider possible relations between x and y. Let's suppose that x is a power of y. Let x = y^k for some integer k. Then substituting into the equation: (y^k)^(y\u00b2) = y^(y^k). Which simplifies to y^{k y\u00b2} = y^{y^k}. Therefore, exponents must be equal: k y\u00b2 = y^k \u2192 k = y^{k-2}.\n\nHmm, so k = y^{k-2}. Let's see for possible integer values of k and y. Let's try y=2. Then k = 2^{k-2}. Let's solve for k:\n\nk=2: 2=2^{0}=1 \u2192 no.\n\nk=3: 3=2^{1}=2 \u2192 no.\n\nk=4:4=2^2=4 \u2192 yes. So k=4. Then x=2^4=16. Which gives us the solution (16,2).\n\nSimilarly, y=3: k=3^{k-2}. Let's try k=3: 3=3^{1}=3 \u2192 yes. So x=3^3=27. Which gives (27,3).\n\nk=4: 4=3^{2}=9 \u2192 no. So only k=3 works for y=3.\n\nFor y=4: k=4^{k-2}. Let's try k=3: 3=4^{1}=4 \u2192 no. k=4:4=4^{2}=16 \u2192 no. So no solution here.\n\nSo this approach gives us the known solutions when x is a power of y. But maybe there are other solutions where x is not a power of y. Let's check.\n\nSuppose x and y are coprime. Then in the equation x^(y\u00b2) = y^x, since x and y are coprime, both sides must be 1, but since x and y are positive integers greater than 0, the only possibility is x=1 and y=1. Which we already have as a solution.\n\nWait, but if x and y are coprime and greater than 1, then x^(y\u00b2) and y^x would be coprime, but that's only possible if both are 1, which isn't possible unless x=y=1. So the only coprime solution is (1,1). So other solutions must have x and y sharing common factors.\n\nSo let's assume that x and y are not coprime. Let\u2019s let d = gcd(x,y), so x = d * a, y = d * b, where gcd(a,b)=1. Then substituting into the equation: (d a)^{(d b)^2} = (d b)^{d a}.\n\nSimplify exponents: d^{d\u00b2 b\u00b2} a^{d\u00b2 b\u00b2} = d^{d a} b^{d a}.\n\nDivide both sides by d^{d a}: d^{d\u00b2 b\u00b2 - d a} a^{d\u00b2 b\u00b2} = b^{d a}.\n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Maybe there's a better approach.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the equation x^(y\u00b2) = y^x. Let's take both sides to the power of 1/(x y):\n\n(x^(y\u00b2))^(1/(x y)) = (y^x)^(1/(x y)) \u2192 x^(y/x) = y^(1/y).\n\nSo x^(y/x) = y^(1/y). Let's take natural logs: (y/x) ln x = (1/y) ln y \u2192 (y\u00b2) ln x = x ln y. Which is the same as before.\n\nLet\u2019s rearrange this as (ln x)/x = (ln y)/y\u00b2. Let\u2019s analyze the function f(t) = (ln t)/t. We know that f(t) increases on (0, e) and decreases on (e, \u221e). Similarly, g(y) = (ln y)/y\u00b2. Let's see how g(y) behaves. The derivative of g(y) is (1/y * y\u00b2 - 2y ln y)/y^4) = (y - 2y ln y)/y^4 = (1 - 2 ln y)/y^3. So critical point when 1 - 2 ln y =0 \u2192 ln y =1/2 \u2192 y=\u221ae \u22481.648. Since y is a positive integer, y=2 is the closest. So g(y) increases up to y=1 (but y\u22651), but since y must be integer \u22651, the maximum of g(y) occurs at y=1, then decreases. Wait, but for y\u22652, g(y) is decreasing because derivative is negative for y>\u221ae. So for y\u22652, g(y) is decreasing.\n\nSimilarly, f(x) = (ln x)/x is decreasing for x\u22653 (since e\u22482.718). So for x\u22653, f(x) decreases.\n\nSo the equation f(x) = g(y) implies that for y\u22652, g(y) is decreasing, and for x\u22653, f(x) is decreasing. So maybe there's a unique solution for each y, but we need to check.\n\nAlternatively, let's fix y and see what x could be. For example, y=2: we need x^4 = 2^x. We saw that x=16 works. Let's check if there are others. For x=2: 16 vs 4 \u2192 no. x=4: 256 vs 16 \u2192 no. x=16: 16^4=65536 vs 2^16=65536 \u2192 yes. x=5: 5^4=625 vs 2^5=32 \u2192 no. So only x=16 works for y=2.\n\nSimilarly, y=3: x^9=3^x. x=3: 19683 vs 3^3=27 \u2192 no. x=27: 27^9=3^27 vs 3^27 \u2192 yes. x=9: 9^9 vs 3^9. 9^9=(3^2)^9=3^18, which is less than 3^9=19683? Wait, no: 3^9=19683, 3^18 is much larger. Wait, 3^18 is 3^9 * 3^9 = 19683*19683 \u2248 387,420,489. But 9^9 is 387,420,489. So 9^9=3^18, which is not equal to 3^9. So x=9 doesn't work. Only x=27 works.\n\nFor y=4: x^16=4^x. Let's see x=16: 16^16=4^32, which is way bigger than 4^16. x=4: 4^16 vs 4^4=256 \u2192 no. x=8: 8^16=2^48 vs 4^8=2^16 \u2192 no. So no solution here.\n\nWhat about y=5: x^25=5^x. Trying x=5: 5^25 vs 5^5 \u2192 no. x=25: 25^25 vs 5^25. 25^25=(5^2)^25=5^50, which is way bigger. So no solution.\n\nSo it seems that for y\u22652, the only solutions are when x is a higher power of y, like y=2 gives x=16=2^4, y=3 gives x=27=3^3. Let's see if there's a pattern here. For y=2, x=2^4, which is y^4. For y=3, x=3^3. Hmm, 4 and 3. Wait, 4 is y+2 when y=2, but that's not consistent. Alternatively, maybe the exponents relate to y. Let's see: For y=2, x=2^4, which is 2^(2^2). Wait, 2^(y^2) would be 2^4=16. Similarly, for y=3, x=3^3=27, which is 3^3. Wait, 3^3 is not 3^(3^2)=3^9. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nWait, but in the equation x^(y\u00b2) = y^x, if we take x = y^k, then substituting gives (y^k)^(y\u00b2) = y^(y^k) \u2192 y^{k y\u00b2} = y^{y^k} \u2192 k y\u00b2 = y^k \u2192 k = y^{k-2}.\n\nSo for each y, we need to find integer k such that k = y^{k-2}. Let's solve for k:\n\nFor y=2: k=2^{k-2}. Let's try k=4: 4=2^{2}=4 \u2192 yes. So k=4, x=2^4=16.\n\nFor y=3: k=3^{k-2}. Try k=3: 3=3^{1}=3 \u2192 yes. So k=3, x=3^3=27.\n\nFor y=4: k=4^{k-2}. Let's try k=3: 3=4^{1}=4 \u2192 no. k=4:4=4^{2}=16 \u2192 no. So no solution.\n\nSimilarly, y=5: k=5^{k-2}. k=3:3=5^1=5 \u2192 no. k=4:4=5^2=25 \u2192 no. So no solution.\n\nThus, the only possible solutions via this method are y=2 (k=4) and y=3 (k=3), giving x=16 and 27 respectively. And the trivial solution (1,1).\n\nNow, we need to check if there are any other solutions where x is not a power of y. Suppose x and y are not powers of each other. Let's assume that x and y share some common factors but aren't powers. For example, maybe x=8 and y=2. Then x=8=2^3, which is a power of y=2. So that's covered. What about x=64 and y=4? Let's check: 64^(4^2)=64^16 vs 4^64. 64=4^3, so 64^16=4^48, and 4^64. Not equal. So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe x=256 and y=2: 256^(4) = 2^256. 256=2^8, so 256^4=2^32, which is not equal to 2^256. So no.\n\nAnother approach: Let's suppose that x > y. Then, for the equation x^(y\u00b2) = y^x, taking logarithms: y\u00b2 ln x = x ln y \u2192 (ln x)/x = (ln y)/y\u00b2. Since x > y, and both are greater than 1, maybe we can compare the growth rates. The function f(t) = (ln t)/t decreases for t > e. So if x > y \u22653, then (ln x)/x < (ln y)/y, but here we have (ln y)/y\u00b2, which is even smaller. So perhaps there's a limited range where this can hold.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider possible values of y and solve for x. For y=1: x^1=1^x \u2192 x=1. So (1,1).\n\nFor y=2: x^4=2^x. We know x=16 works. Let's check if there's another x. For x=4: 256 vs 16 \u2192 no. x=2: 16 vs 4 \u2192 no. x=16: yes. x=5: 625 vs 32 \u2192 no. So only x=16.\n\nFor y=3: x^9=3^x. x=3: 19683 vs 27 \u2192 no. x=27: yes. x=9: 9^9 vs 3^9 \u2192 9^9=3^18, which is not equal to 3^9. So no.\n\nFor y=4: x^16=4^x. x=4: 4^16 vs 256 \u2192 no. x=16: 16^16 vs 4^16 \u2192 16^16=4^32, which is larger. x=2: 2^16=65536 vs 4^2=16 \u2192 no.\n\nFor y=5: x^25=5^x. x=5: 5^25 vs 5^5 \u2192 no. x=25: 25^25 vs 5^25 \u2192 25^25=5^50, which is larger. So no.\n\nFor y=6: x^36=6^x. Trying x=6: 6^36 vs 6^6 \u2192 no. x=36: 36^36 vs 6^36 \u2192 36^36=6^72, which is larger.\n\nSo it seems that beyond y=3, there are no solutions. What about y=0? Wait, y must be positive integer, so y=0 is excluded.\n\nAnother angle: Suppose that x and y are both greater than 1. We can consider the equation x^(y\u00b2) = y^x. Let's take the y-th root of both sides: x^(y) = y^(x/y). Hmm, not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, let's write x = y^k, as before. Then we get y^{k y\u00b2} = y^{y^k} \u2192 k y\u00b2 = y^k \u2192 k = y^{k-2}. So for each y, we need to find integer k such that k = y^{k-2}. We saw that for y=2, k=4 works (4=2^{4-2}=2^2=4). For y=3, k=3 works (3=3^{3-2}=3^1=3). For y=4, solving k=4^{k-2} would require k=4^{k-2}. Let's try k=3: 3=4^1=4 \u2192 no. k=4:4=4^2=16 \u2192 no. So no solution. Similarly for higher y.\n\nThus, the only possible solutions via this substitution are y=2 and y=3, leading to x=16 and x=27. Combined with the trivial solution (1,1), these are the only possibilities.\n\nTo",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, we know that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two positive integers m and n is 6, and their least common multiple (lcm) is 126. We need to find the least possible value of m + n and show that it's 60. Hmm, let's start by recalling some properties of gcd and lcm.\n\nFirst, I remember that for any two positive integers, the product of their gcd and lcm is equal to the product of the numbers themselves. So, m * n = gcd(m, n) * lcm(m, n). Let me check that with the example given in the context. In the example, gcd(6, 15) is 3, and lcm is 30. Then 6*15 = 90, and 3*30 = 90. Yep, that works. So this formula should hold here too.\n\nGiven that gcd(m, n) is 6 and lcm(m, n) is 126, then m * n = 6 * 126 = 756. So the product of m and n is 756. Now, since the gcd is 6, both m and n must be multiples of 6. Let me express m and n in terms of the gcd. Let's say m = 6a and n = 6b, where a and b are positive integers that are coprime, meaning their gcd is 1. Because if a and b had a common divisor greater than 1, then the gcd of m and n would be higher than 6, which contradicts the given.\n\nSo substituting m = 6a and n = 6b into the product equation: (6a) * (6b) = 756. Simplifying, 36ab = 756. Dividing both sides by 36 gives ab = 21. So now, a and b are coprime positive integers such that their product is 21. We need to find pairs (a, b) where a and b are coprime and a * b = 21, then compute m + n = 6a + 6b = 6(a + b), and find the minimum value of this sum.\n\nThe possible pairs (a, b) that multiply to 21 are (1, 21) and (3, 7). Let's check their coprimality. For (1, 21), gcd(1, 21) is 1, so that's good. For (3, 7), gcd(3, 7) is also 1. Are there any other pairs? Well, 21 factors into 1*21 and 3*7. Since 21 is 3*7, but those are already considered. So those are the only two pairs where a \u2264 b to avoid duplicates.\n\nNow, compute a + b for each pair. For (1, 21), a + b = 22. For (3, 7), a + b = 10. Then m + n would be 6*22 = 132 and 6*10 = 60. So the minimum possible value is 60. Therefore, the least possible value of m + n is 60.\n\nWait, but let me make sure there are no other pairs. For example, could a and b be fractions? No, because they have to be positive integers. So the only possible pairs are indeed (1,21) and (3,7). Therefore, 60 is the minimal sum. That makes sense. So the answer is 60.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nWe start by using the fundamental relationship between the greatest common divisor (gcd) and least common multiple (lcm) of two numbers:  \n**For any two positive integers \\( m \\) and \\( n \\),**  \n\\[\nm \\times n = \\gcd(m, n) \\times \\lcm(m, n).\n\\]  \nGiven \\(\\gcd(m, n) = 6\\) and \\(\\lcm(m, n) = 126\\), substituting these values gives:  \n\\[\nm \\times n = 6 \\times 126 = 756.\n\\]  \n\nSince \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) share a gcd of \\( 6 \\), we can express them as \\( m = 6a \\) and \\( n = 6b \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are coprime integers (i.e., \\(\\gcd(a, b) = 1\\)). Substituting these into the product equation:  \n\\[\n(6a) \\times (6b) = 756 \\implies 36ab = 756 \\implies ab = 21.\n\\]  \n\nWe now seek coprime pairs \\((a, b)\\) such that \\( ab = 21 \\). The valid pairs are:  \n1. \\((1, 21)\\): Here, \\( a + b = 22 \\).  \n2. \\((3, 7)\\): Here, \\( a + b = 10 \\).  \n\nNo other coprime pairs exist because \\( 21 \\) factors only as \\( 1 \\times 21 \\) and \\( 3 \\times 7 \\).  \n\nFinally, calculate \\( m + n = 6a + 6b = 6(a + b) \\):  \n- For \\((1, 21)\\): \\( 6 \\times 22 = 132 \\).  \n- For \\((3, 7)\\): \\( 6 \\times 10 = 60 \\).  \n\nThe smallest possible value of \\( m + n \\) is therefore **60**, achieved when \\( m = 6 \\times 3 = 18 \\) and \\( n = 6 \\times 7 = 42 \\).

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The problem states that a positive integer X is 2 more than a multiple of 3, which means when X is divided by 3, the remainder is 2. So mathematically, we can write this as X \u2261 2 mod 3. \n\nThen, the units digit of X is the same as the units digit of a number that is 4 more than a multiple of 5. Let's parse that. A number that's 4 more than a multiple of 5 can be written as 5k + 4 for some integer k. The units digit of such a number depends on k. For example, if k=0, it's 4; k=1, it's 9; k=2, it's 14 (units digit 4), and so on. So the units digits cycle between 4 and 9. Therefore, the units digit of X must be either 4 or 9.\n\nSo, combining these two conditions: X \u2261 2 mod 3, and the units digit of X is either 4 or 9. We need to find the smallest positive integer X that satisfies both.\n\nLet's list numbers that are 2 more than multiples of 3. Starting from the smallest positive integers:\n\n3*0 + 2 = 2 (units digit 2) \u2192 doesn't match 4 or 9\n3*1 + 2 = 5 (units digit 5) \u2192 no\n3*2 + 2 = 8 (units digit 8) \u2192 no\n3*3 + 2 = 11 (units digit 1) \u2192 no\n3*4 + 2 = 14 (units digit 4) \u2192 matches one of the possible units digits\n3*5 + 2 = 17 (units digit 7) \u2192 no\n3*6 + 2 = 20 (units digit 0) \u2192 no\n3*7 + 2 = 23 (units digit 3) \u2192 no\n3*8 + 2 = 26 (units digit 6) \u2192 no\n3*9 + 2 = 29 (units digit 9) \u2192 matches the other possible units digit\n\nSo from this list, the numbers that fit both conditions are 14 (units digit 4) and 29 (units digit 9). Since we're looking for the smallest possible X, 14 is the answer.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check. The problem mentions that the units digit of X is the same as the units digit of a number that is 4 more than a multiple of 5. Let's confirm that 14's units digit (4) matches the units digit of some number 5k + 4. For k=0, 5*0 +4 =4, which has units digit 4. So yes, 14's units digit matches. Similarly, 29's units digit 9 matches 5*1 +4=9. So both are valid, but 14 is smaller.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible X is 14.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nWe need to find the smallest positive integer \\( X \\) that satisfies two conditions:\n1. \\( X \\) is 2 more than a multiple of 3, i.e., \\( X \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3} \\).\n2. The units digit of \\( X \\) matches the units digit of a number that is 4 more than a multiple of 5.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the units digit condition**  \nA number that is 4 more than a multiple of 5 has the form \\( 5k + 4 \\). The units digit of such numbers cycles between 4 and 9:\n- \\( k = 0 \\): \\( 5(0) + 4 = 4 \\) (units digit 4)\n- \\( k = 1 \\): \\( 5(1) + 4 = 9 \\) (units digit 9)\n- \\( k = 2 \\): \\( 5(2) + 4 = 14 \\) (units digit 4)\n- and so on.\n\nThus, the units digit of \\( X \\) must be **4 or 9**.\n\n**Step 2: List numbers satisfying \\( X \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3} \\)**  \nNumbers congruent to 2 modulo 3 are:\n\\[\n2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23, 26, 29, \\dots\n\\]\nWe check their units digits:\n- \\( 2 \\) (units digit 2) \u274c\n- \\( 5 \\) (units digit 5) \u274c\n- \\( 8 \\) (units digit 8) \u274c\n- \\( 11 \\) (units digit 1) \u274c\n- \\( 14 \\) (units digit 4) \u2705\n- \\( 17 \\) (units digit 7) \u274c\n- \\( 20 \\) (units digit 0) \u274c\n- \\( 23 \\) (units digit 3) \u274c\n- \\( 26 \\) (units digit 6) \u274c\n- \\( 29 \\) (units digit 9) \u2705\n\n**Step 3: Identify the smallest valid \\( X \\)**  \nFrom the list, \\( 14 \\) (units digit 4) and \\( 29 \\) (units digit 9) satisfy both conditions. Since \\( 14 < 29 \\), the smallest possible \\( X \\) is **14**.\n\n**Verification**  \n- \\( 14 \\div 3 = 4 \\) with remainder \\( 2 \\), so \\( 14 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3} \\).\n- The units digit of \\( 14 \\) is 4, which matches the units digit of \\( 5(0) + 4 = 4 \\).\n\nThus, \\( X = 14 \\) is the smallest solution.\nPrevious attempt failed with: type mismatch\n  h\u2081\nhas type\n  y % 5 = 4 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  y % 10 = 4 : Prop\ntype mismatch\n  h\u2081\nhas type\n  y % 5 = 4 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  y % 10 = 4 : Prop\ntype mismatch\n  h\u2081\nhas type\n  y % 5 = 4 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  y % 10 = 4 : Prop\ntype mismatch\n  this\nhas type\n  x % 10 = 4 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  x % 10 = 4 \u2228 x % 10 = 9 : Prop\ntype mismatch\n  this\nhas type\n  x % 10 = 4 \u2228 x % 10 = 9 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  x % 10 = 4 \u2192 x % 10 = 4 \u2228 x % 10 = 9 : Prop\ntype mismatch\n  this\nhas type\n  x % 10 = 4 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  x \u2265 14 : Prop\ntype mismatch\n  this\nhas type\n  x % 10 = 9 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  x \u2265 14 : Prop\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: type mismatch\n  h\u2081\nhas type\n  y % 5 = 4 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  y % 10 = 4 : Prop\ntype mismatch\n  Eq.symm (mod_eq_of_lt ?m.916)\nhas type\n  ?m.924 = ?m.924 % ?m.915 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  4 = 4 \u2228 4 = 9 : Prop\nexpected type must not contain free or meta variables\n  x < 10\nexpected type must not contain free or meta variables\n  0 < x\nexpected type must not contain free or meta variables\n  x % 14 = 0\nexpected type must not contain free or meta variables\n  0 < x\nexpected type must not contain free or meta variables\n  x % 14 = 0\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: type mismatch\n  h\u2081\nhas type\n  y % 5 = 4 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  y % 10 = 4 : Prop\nunsolved goals\nx y : \u2115\nh\u2080\u271d : x % 3 = 2\nh\u2081 : y % 5 = 4\nh\u2082 : x % 10 = y % 10\nh\u2083\u271d this\u271d\u2076 : x % 10 = 4\nthis\u271d\u2075 : x % 3 = 2\nh\u2083 : x % 10 = 4\nh\u2080 : x % 3 = 2\nthis\u271d\u2074 : x % 10 = 4\nthis\u271d\u00b3 : x % 3 = 2\nthis\u271d\u00b2 : x % 10 = 4\nthis\u271d\u00b9 : x % 3 = 2\nthis\u271d : x % 10 = 4\nthis : x % 3 = 2\n\u22a2 ?m.1693 < ?m.1694\nunsolved goals\nx y : \u2115\nh\u2080\u271d : x % 3 = 2\nh\u2081 : y % 5 = 4\nh\u2082 : x % 10 = y % 10\nh\u2083\u271d this\u271d\u2075 : x % 10 = 4\nthis\u271d\u2074 : x % 3 = 2\nh\u2083 : x % 10 = 4\nh\u2080 : x % 3 = 2\nthis\u271d\u00b3 : x % 10 = 4\nthis\u271d\u00b2 : x % 3 = 2\nthis\u271d\u00b9 : x % 10 = 4\nthis\u271d : x % 3 = 2\nthis : x = 14\n\u22a2 ?m.2203 < ?m.2204\nunsolved goals\nx y : \u2115\nh\u2080\u271d : x % 3 = 2\nh\u2081 : y % 5 = 4\nh\u2082 : x % 10 = y % 10\nh\u2083\u271d this\u271d\u00b3 : x % 10 = 4\nthis\u271d\u00b2 : x % 3 = 2\nh\u2083 : x % 10 = 4\nh\u2080 : x % 3 = 2\nthis\u271d\u00b9 : x % 10 = 4\nthis\u271d : x % 3 = 2\nthis : x = 14\n\u22a2 ?m.2700 < ?m.2701\nunsolved goals\nx y : \u2115\nh\u2080\u271d : x % 3 = 2\nh\u2081 : y % 5 = 4\nh\u2082 : x % 10 = y % 10\nh\u2083\u271d this\u271d\u2076 : x % 10 = 9\nthis\u271d\u2075 : x % 3 = 2\nh\u2083 : x % 10 = 9\nh\u2080 : x % 3 = 2\nthis\u271d\u2074 : x % 10 = 9\nthis\u271d\u00b3 : x % 3 = 2\nthis\u271d\u00b2 : x % 10 = 9\nthis\u271d\u00b9 : x % 3 = 2\nthis\u271d : x % 10 = 9\nthis : x % 3 = 2\n\u22a2 ?m.3927 < ?m.3928\nunsolved goals\nx y : \u2115\nh\u2080\u271d : x % 3 = 2\nh\u2081 : y % 5 = 4\nh\u2082 : x % 10 = y % 10\nh\u2083\u271d this\u271d\u2075 : x % 10 = 9\nthis\u271d\u2074 : x % 3 = 2\nh\u2083 : x % 10 = 9\nh\u2080 : x % 3 = 2\nthis\u271d\u00b3 : x % 10 = 9\nthis\u271d\u00b2 : x % 3 = 2\nthis\u271d\u00b9 : x % 10 = 9\nthis\u271d : x % 3 = 2\nthis : x = 14\n\u22a2 ?m.4424 < ?m.4425\nunsolved goals\nx y : \u2115\nh\u2080\u271d : x % 3 = 2\nh\u2081 : y % 5 = 4\nh\u2082 : x % 10 = y % 10\nh\u2083\u271d this\u271d\u00b3 : x % 10 = 9\nthis\u271d\u00b2 : x % 3 = 2\nh\u2083 : x % 10 = 9\nh\u2080 : x % 3 = 2\nthis\u271d\u00b9 : x % 10 = 9\nthis\u271d : x % 3 = 2\nthis : x = 14\n\u22a2 ?m.4921 < ?m.4922\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, Mr. Wrench charges a fixed fee N just for coming out, plus x dollars per hour of work. We need to find out what he charges for a two-hour job, and show it's $139.\n\nFirst, let's parse the given information. For a one-hour job, the total charge was $97. That should be the fixed fee N plus x times 1 hour. So, equation one is N + x = 97.\n\nThen, for a five-hour job, the charge was $265. Similarly, that's N plus x times 5 hours. So equation two is N + 5x = 265.\n\nNow, we have two equations with two variables, N and x. The goal is to solve for these variables and then compute the charge for two hours, which would be N + 2x.\n\nLet me think about how to solve these equations. If we subtract the first equation from the second, the N terms will cancel out. Let's try that:\n\n(N + 5x) - (N + x) = 265 - 97\n\nSimplifying the left side: N - N + 5x - x = 4x\n\nRight side: 265 - 97 is 168. So, 4x = 168. Dividing both sides by 4 gives x = 42.\n\nNow that we know x is $42 per hour, we can plug that back into the first equation to find N. So, N + 42 = 97. Subtracting 42 from both sides gives N = 55.\n\nSo the fixed fee is $55, and the hourly rate is $42. Now, for a two-hour job, the charge would be N + 2x = 55 + 2*42. Let's compute that: 2*42 is 84, plus 55 is 139. That checks out with the answer we need to show.\n\nWait, let me double-check the calculations. If x is 42, then five hours would be 5*42 = 210. Adding the fixed fee of 55 gives 265, which matches the given five-hour charge. And one hour is 55 + 42 = 97, which matches the one-hour charge. So the values are correct. Therefore, two hours would indeed be 55 + 84 = 139. Yep, that makes sense.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo determine Mr. Wrench's charge for a two-hour repair job, we start by analyzing the given information. Let\u2019s break down the problem:\n\n1. **Fixed and Variable Costs**:  \n   Mr. Wrench charges a fixed fee \\( N \\) (for arriving at the house) plus \\( x \\) dollars per hour worked.  \n   - For a **1-hour job**, the total charge is \\( N + x = 97 \\).  \n   - For a **5-hour job**, the total charge is \\( N + 5x = 265 \\).\n\n2. **Solving for \\( x \\)**:  \n   Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \\( N \\):  \n   \\[\n   (N + 5x) - (N + x) = 265 - 97 \\implies 4x = 168 \\implies x = 42.\n   \\]  \n   This gives the hourly rate: **\\$42 per hour**.\n\n3. **Solving for \\( N \\)**:  \n   Substitute \\( x = 42 \\) into the first equation:  \n   \\[\n   N + 42 = 97 \\implies N = 55.\n   \\]  \n   The fixed fee is **\\$55**.\n\n4. **Calculating the Two-Hour Charge**:  \n   For a **2-hour job**, the total charge is:  \n   \\[\n   N + 2x = 55 + 2(42) = 55 + 84 = 139.\n   \\]  \n\n**Verification**:  \n- For 1 hour: \\( 55 + 42 = 97 \\) (matches the given charge).  \n- For 5 hours: \\( 55 + 5(42) = 265 \\) (also matches).  \nThus, the calculation for the two-hour job is consistent and correct. The final charge is **\\$139**.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about figuring out the daily caloric requirement based on a snack that's 2% of that requirement. The tin has 40 calories and that's 2% of the daily requirement. We need to show that the total is 2000 calories.\n\nHmm, percentages. So if 40 calories represent 2%, then the total daily calories would be 100%. The key here is understanding that percentage parts relate to the whole. So 2% corresponds to 40, so 1% would be half of that, which is 20. Then 100% would be 20 times 100, which is 2000. That makes sense. Let me check if there's another way to approach it, maybe using equations. Let's let x be the total daily calories. Then 2% of x is 40. So 0.02 * x = 40. Solving for x, divide both sides by 0.02. 40 divided by 0.02 is 2000. Yep, that works. Both methods lead to the same answer. I should explain both approaches to make it clear. Maybe start with the equation method since it's more algebraic, then the percentage breakdown for intuition. Make sure to mention that 2% being 40 means each 1% is 20, so scaling up gives 100% as 2000. That should cover it.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo determine the daily caloric requirement, we start by recognizing that 40 calories represent 2% of the total requirement. Let\u2019s denote the total daily calories as \\( x \\). By definition of percentages, 2% of \\( x \\) equals 40 calories. This relationship can be written as:\n\n\\[\n0.02 \\times x = 40\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\( x \\), divide both sides of the equation by 0.02:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{40}{0.02}\n\\]\n\nCalculating the right-hand side, \\( 40 \\div 0.02 \\) is equivalent to \\( 40 \\times 50 \\) (since dividing by 0.02 is the same as multiplying by 100/2 = 50). This gives:\n\n\\[\nx = 2000\n\\]\n\n**Alternative intuition:** If 2% corresponds to 40 calories, then 1% of the daily requirement is \\( 40 \\div 2 = 20 \\) calories. Scaling this up to 100% (the full daily requirement), we multiply by 100:\n\n\\[\n20 \\times 100 = 2000\n\\]\n\nBoth methods confirm that the total daily caloric requirement is **2000 calories**.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to expand the product (x + 1)^2 multiplied by x and show that it equals x^3 + 2x^2 + x. Let me think about how to approach this step by step. \n\nFirst, I remember that expanding something like (x + 1)^2 is similar to the example given in the context, where they expanded (x + 1)^2 to x^2 + 2x + 1 using the distributive property. So maybe I can start by expanding (x + 1)^2 first and then multiply the result by x.\n\nLet me try that. Starting with (x + 1)^2. According to the example, that's (x + 1)(x + 1). Applying the distributive property, which is a(b + c) = ab + ac, but here we have two binomials. So, multiply each term in the first binomial by each term in the second binomial. That would be x*x + x*1 + 1*x + 1*1. Simplifying that gives x\u00b2 + x + x + 1, which combines to x\u00b2 + 2x + 1. Okay, that matches the example. So (x + 1)^2 is x\u00b2 + 2x + 1.\n\nNow, the original problem is to multiply this result by x. So we have (x\u00b2 + 2x + 1) * x. To expand this, I need to distribute the x across each term inside the parentheses. That means multiplying x by x\u00b2, x by 2x, and x by 1. Let's do each part step by step.\n\nFirst term: x * x\u00b2. When you multiply variables with exponents, you add the exponents. So x is x^1, and x\u00b2 is x^2. 1 + 2 = 3, so that's x\u00b3.\n\nSecond term: x * 2x. Again, x is x^1, so 1 + 1 = 2, making x\u00b2. Multiply that by 2, so 2x\u00b2.\n\nThird term: x * 1. That's straightforward, just x.\n\nPutting all those together: x\u00b3 + 2x\u00b2 + x. Which is exactly what we needed to show. Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss any steps or make any mistakes in the multiplication.\n\nStarting over, (x + 1)^2 is x\u00b2 + 2x + 1. Multiply by x: x*(x\u00b2) + x*(2x) + x*(1). Yep, that's x\u00b3 + 2x\u00b2 + x. Looks correct. I think that's all there is to it. The key steps were expanding the square first using the distributive property and then distributing the x across each term of the resulting trinomial.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo expand the product \\((x + 1)^2 \\cdot x\\) and show it equals \\(x^3 + 2x^2 + x\\), we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **First, expand \\((x + 1)^2\\):**\n   - Start by writing \\((x + 1)^2\\) as \\((x + 1)(x + 1)\\).\n   - Apply the distributive property (also known as the FOIL method for binomials):\n     \\[\n     (x + 1)(x + 1) = x \\cdot x + x \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot x + 1 \\cdot 1.\n     \\]\n   - Simplify each term:\n     \\[\n     x^2 + x + x + 1 = x^2 + 2x + 1.\n     \\]\n   - Thus, \\((x + 1)^2 = x^2 + 2x + 1\\).\n\n2. **Multiply the result by \\(x\\):**\n   - Now, take the expanded form \\(x^2 + 2x + 1\\) and multiply it by \\(x\\):\n     \\[\n     (x^2 + 2x + 1) \\cdot x.\n     \\]\n   - Distribute \\(x\\) across all terms in the parentheses:\n     \\[\n     x \\cdot x^2 + x \\cdot 2x + x \\cdot 1.\n     \\]\n   - Simplify each term:\n     - \\(x \\cdot x^2 = x^{1+2} = x^3\\),\n     - \\(x \\cdot 2x = 2x^{1+1} = 2x^2\\),\n     - \\(x \\cdot 1 = x\\).\n   - Combine the simplified terms:\n     \\[\n     x^3 + 2x^2 + x.\n     \\]\n\n**Conclusion:** The expanded form of \\((x + 1)^2 \\cdot x\\) is indeed \\(x^3 + 2x^2 + x\\).

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to prove that for any integer n \u2265 3, n! is less than n^{n-1}. Let me start by recalling what n! means. It's the product of all positive integers up to n, right? So n! = 1 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 ... \u00d7 n. On the other hand, n^{n-1} is n multiplied by itself (n-1) times. \n\nHmm, let's take a small example to see if this holds. If n=3, then 3! = 6 and 3^{2} = 9. 6 < 9, which works. For n=4, 4! = 24 and 4^3 = 64. Still true. So the base cases check out. But how do I generalize this?\n\nLooking at the context given, there's a theorem that for m >1 and any positive integer n, n < m^n. The proof used a geometric series. Maybe there's a similar approach here. Wait, but here we have factorials and exponents. Maybe induction?\n\nLet me think about induction. Suppose it's true for some k \u22653, i.e., k! < k^{k-1}. Then for k+1, we have (k+1)! = (k+1) \u00d7 k! < (k+1) \u00d7 k^{k-1}. Now, we need to show this is less than (k+1)^k. So, is (k+1) \u00d7 k^{k-1} < (k+1)^k? Let's see. Dividing both sides by (k+1), we get k^{k-1} < (k+1)^{k-1}. But since k < k+1, raising both sides to the (k-1) power preserves the inequality. So yes, k^{k-1} < (k+1)^{k-1}, so multiplying by (k+1) maintains the inequality. Therefore, if it's true for k, it's true for k+1. The base case n=3 holds, so by induction, the inequality holds for all n \u22653.\n\nAlternatively, maybe expand n! and n^{n-1} and compare terms. Let's see. n! = 1\u00d72\u00d73\u00d7...\u00d7n. n^{n-1} = n \u00d7 n \u00d7 ... \u00d7 n (n-1 times). Wait, but n^{n-1} is n multiplied by itself (n-1) times. So n! has terms from 1 up to n, while n^{n-1} has n repeated (n-1) times. Since n \u22653, each term in n! except the last one (which is n) is less than n. For example, in 4! = 1\u00d72\u00d73\u00d74, the first three terms are 1,2,3, which are all less than 4. So 4! = 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d71 = 24, and 4^3 = 64. The product of smaller numbers vs. multiplying 4 three times. \n\nBut how to formalize this? Maybe compare each term in the product. Let's consider that in n! = 1\u00d72\u00d7...\u00d7(n-1)\u00d7n. The product has n terms. But n^{n-1} is n multiplied (n-1) times. So n! = n \u00d7 (n-1)! and n^{n-1} = n^{n-1}. Wait, maybe we can write n^{n-1} as n \u00d7 n \u00d7 ... \u00d7 n (n-1 terms). Then, compare (n-1)! with n^{n-2}. Because n! = n \u00d7 (n-1)! and n^{n-1} = n \u00d7 n^{n-2}. So if we can show that (n-1)! < n^{n-2}, then multiplying both sides by n gives n! < n^{n-1}. \n\nSo the problem reduces to showing (n-1)! < n^{n-2} for n \u22653. Let's check for n=3: (3-1)! = 2! = 2 and 3^{1} =3. 2 <3. For n=4: 3! =6 and 4^2=16. 6<16. So that works. Maybe induction again? Assume (k-1)! < k^{k-2}, then show k! < (k+1)^{k-1}. Wait, not sure. Alternatively, maybe use the theorem from the context. The original theorem was n < m^n when m>1. Here, maybe relate factorial growth to exponential growth. \n\nAlternatively, think of the number of terms and their sizes. The factorial multiplies numbers starting from 1 up to n, while n^{n-1} multiplies n (n-1) times. Each term in the factorial (except the last one) is less than n, so the product should be less. For example, 1\u00d72\u00d73\u00d7...\u00d7n vs n\u00d7n\u00d7...\u00d7n (n-1 times). Wait, but n! has n terms, and n^{n-1} has (n-1) terms. Wait, no: n! is product of n terms (1 to n), but n^{n-1} is product of (n-1) terms, each n. So actually, n! has one more term, but each term except the last is smaller. Hmm, maybe that's a way to compare. Let's see: n! = (1\u00d72\u00d7...\u00d7(n-1)) \u00d7n. The first part (n-1)! is 1\u00d72\u00d7...\u00d7(n-1), and n^{n-1} is n\u00d7n\u00d7...\u00d7n (n-1 times). So (n-1)! < n^{n-1} /n = n^{n-2}. Wait, that's similar to the earlier approach. So if (n-1)! < n^{n-2}, then multiplying both sides by n gives n! <n^{n-1}. So the key is to show (n-1)! <n^{n-2}. \n\nHow to show (n-1)! <n^{n-2} for n\u22653? Maybe induction again. Base case n=3: (3-1)! =2 <3^{1}=3. Assume true for k: (k-1)! <k^{k-2}. Then for k+1: k! =k\u00d7(k-1)! <k\u00d7k^{k-2} =k^{k-1}. But we need to show k! < (k+1)^{(k+1)-2} = (k+1)^{k-1}. So is k^{k-1} < (k+1)^{k-1}? Yes, because k <k+1. So k^{k-1} < (k+1)^{k-1}, hence k! < (k+1)^{k-1}. Therefore, by induction, (n-1)! <n^{n-2} holds for all n\u22653. Therefore, multiplying by n gives n! <n^{n-1}. \n\nAlternatively, another approach: use the inequality that for positive integers a_1, a_2,...,a_n, the product is maximized when the terms are as equal as possible. But not sure. Alternatively, use logarithms to compare the products. Taking log of n! is sum of logs from 1 to n, and log(n^{n-1}) is (n-1) log n. So need to show sum_{k=1}^n log k < (n-1) log n. But sum_{k=1}^n log k = log n! and (n-1) log n = log n^{n-1}. So this is equivalent to the original inequality. Not sure if that helps directly. \n\nAlternatively, count the number of terms and compare. For n! vs n^{n-1}: n! has n terms, each up to n, while n^{n-1} has (n-1) terms, each exactly n. Wait, but n! has terms 1,2,...,n, so their product is less than n^n (which is n terms of n). But here we have n^{n-1}, which is one less term. So n! is less than n^n, but we need to show it's less than n^{n-1}. Since n^{n-1} = n^n /n, so n! <n^{n}/n \u2192 n! \u00d7n <n^n. But n! \u00d7n = (n+1)! / (n+1) ? Wait, no. Wait, n! \u00d7n = n! \u00d7n = (n+1)! / (n+1) \u00d7n? Not sure. Maybe not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, think of n! as n \u00d7 (n-1) \u00d7 ... \u00d71 and n^{n-1} as n \u00d7n \u00d7...\u00d7n (n-1 times). So n! has one term of n, and the rest (n-1 terms) are 1 to n-1. While n^{n-1} has all terms as n. So each term in n! except the last is \u2264n, but in n^{n-1}, all terms are exactly n. So replacing the first (n-1) terms in n! (which are \u2264n) with n would make the product larger. Therefore, n! = n \u00d7 (n-1)! \u2264n \u00d7n^{n-2} =n^{n-1}. Wait, but this is exactly the same as the induction step. So maybe this is the way to go. \n\nSo summarizing: For n \u22653, (n-1)! <n^{n-2}, then multiplying both sides by n gives n! <n^{n-1}. To show (n-1)! <n^{n-2}, use induction. Base case n=3: 2! =2 <3^{1}=3. Assume true for k: (k-1)! <k^{k-2}. Then for k+1: k! =k \u00d7(k-1)! <k \u00d7k^{k-2} =k^{k-1}. Now, k^{k-1} < (k+1)^{k-1} because k <k+1. Therefore, k! < (k+1)^{k-1}, which is the required form for the next step. Hence, by induction, the inequality holds. Therefore, n! <n^{n-1} for all n\u22653.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo show that \\( n! < n^{n-1} \\) for all integers \\( n \\geq 3 \\), we can use mathematical induction and compare the growth patterns of factorials and exponentials.\n\n**Base Case (\\( n = 3 \\)):**  \nCompute \\( 3! = 6 \\) and \\( 3^{3-1} = 9 \\). Since \\( 6 < 9 \\), the inequality holds for \\( n = 3 \\).\n\n**Inductive Step:**  \nAssume the inequality holds for some integer \\( k \\geq 3 \\), i.e., \\( k! < k^{k-1} \\). We need to show it holds for \\( k+1 \\):  \n\\[\n(k+1)! = (k+1) \\cdot k! \\quad \\text{and} \\quad (k+1)^{(k+1)-1} = (k+1)^k.\n\\]  \nUsing the inductive hypothesis \\( k! < k^{k-1} \\), substitute into the expression for \\( (k+1)! \\):  \n\\[\n(k+1)! < (k+1) \\cdot k^{k-1}.\n\\]  \nNow compare this to \\( (k+1)^k \\).

Multiplying both sides by \\( k+1 \\) maintains the inequality. Thus:  \n\\[\n(k+1)! < (k+1)^k.\n\\]  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nBy induction, the inequality \\( n! < n^{n-1} \\) holds for all integers \\( n \\geq 3 \\). The key idea is that factorial growth is outpaced by exponential growth of the form \\( n^{n-1} \\), as replacing smaller terms in the factorial product with \\( n \\) (as in the exponential) strictly increases the product.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unexpected token '<'; expected term\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unexpected token '<'; expected term\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unexpected token '<'; expected term\nPlease revise the proof.",

Hmm, first, I need to compute both roots separately and then subtract them. Let's start with the square root.\n\nThe square root of 1,000,000. Well, 1,000,000 is a perfect square because it's 1000 squared. Wait, 1000 times 1000 is 1,000,000. So \u221a1,000,000 is 1000. That part seems straightforward.\n\nNow the cube root.

The square of 1000 is (1000)^2 = 1,000,000. Correct. The cube of 100 is (100)^3 = 1,000,000. So yes, \u221a1,000,000 is 1000, and \u221b1,000,000 is 100.

But maybe the problem is designed to highlight that these are perfect powers, so their roots are integers, making the difference exact. \n\nBut let me check if there's any trick here. The problem says to show that the difference is 900. Since both roots are integers, their difference is exactly 900. So the key here is recognizing that 1,000,000 is both a perfect square and a perfect cube, but wait, actually, no. Wait, 1,000,000 is a perfect square (1000^2) and a perfect cube (100^3). Wait, but 100^3 is 1,000,000, and 1000^2 is also 1,000,000. So the number is both a square and a cube, which makes it a sixth power. Because 1,000,000 is 10^6. So 10^6 = (10^3)^2 = (10^2)^3. Therefore, the square root is 10^3 = 1000, and the cube root is 10^2 = 100. Hence, the difference is 900. \n\nSo the proof is straightforward once you recognize that 1,000,000 is a sixth power. But maybe the problem expects me to elaborate more. Let me structure this step by step. First, express 1,000,000 as 10^6. Then, compute the square root: \u221a(10^6) = 10^(6/2) = 10^3 = 1000. Then compute the cube root: \u221b(10^6) = 10^(6/3) = 10^2 = 100. Subtract them: 1000 - 100 = 900. Therefore, the difference is indeed 900. \n\nI think that's all there is to it. The problem might be testing the understanding of exponents and roots, especially recognizing that a number can be expressed as different powers and how to handle roots of such numbers. Since 1,000,000 is a perfect sixth power, both roots are integers, leading to an exact difference. No approximation needed here, unlike the examples in the context where they dealt with non-perfect powers and fractional parts. But in this case, since it's a perfect power, the difference is exact and straightforward.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo find the value of \\(\\sqrt{1,\\!000,\\!000} - \\sqrt[3]{1,\\!000,\\!000}\\), we start by recognizing that \\(1,\\!000,\\!000\\) is a perfect power. Specifically, it can be written as \\(10^6\\). This allows us to compute both roots exactly.\n\n1. **Square Root Calculation**:  \n   The square root of \\(10^6\\) is calculated by halving the exponent:  \n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{10^6} = 10^{6/2} = 10^3 = 1,\\!000.\n   \\]  \n   Thus, \\(\\sqrt{1,\\!000,\\!000} = 1,\\!000\\).\n\n2. **Cube Root Calculation**:  \n   The cube root of \\(10^6\\) is found by dividing the exponent by 3:  \n   \\[\n   \\sqrt[3]{10^6} = 10^{6/3} = 10^2 = 100.\n   \\]  \n   Therefore, \\(\\sqrt[3]{1,\\!000,\\!000} = 100\\).\n\n3. **Subtracting the Results**:  \n   The difference between the two roots is:  \n   \\[\n   1,\\!000 - 100 = 900.\n   \\]  \n\nSince \\(1,\\!000,\\!000\\) is a perfect \\(6\\)th power (\\(10^6\\)), both roots simplify to integers, ensuring the difference is exact. This confirms that \\(\\sqrt{1,\\!000,\\!000} - \\sqrt[3]{1,\\!000,\\!000} = 900\\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: unsolved goals\n\u22a2 rexp (Real.log 1000000 * (1 / 2)) - rexp (Real.log 1000000 * (1 / 3)) = 900\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  1000000\nh : 1000000 = 10 ^ 6\n\u22a2 \u221a(10 ^ 6) = 10 ^ 3\nfailed to synthesize\n  HPow \u2115 \u211d ?m.1734\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nunsolved goals\nh : 1000000 = 10 ^ 6\nh1 : \u221a(10 ^ 6) = 10 ^ 3\n\u22a2 0 < ?m.2697\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  \u221a(10 ^ 6)\ncase refine_1\nh : 1000000 = 10 ^ 6\nh1 : \u221a(10 ^ 6) = 10 ^ 3\n\u22a2 HPow \u2115 \u211d \u2115\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: linarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase h1.h\na\u271d : 1000000 ^ (1 / 2) - 1000000 ^ (1 / 3) < 900\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nunsolved goals\n\u22a2 1000000 ^ (1 / 2) - 1000000 ^ (1 / 3) = 900\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to compute the sum S from 2010 to 4018 inclusive, and then find its residue modulo 2009. The problem states that the residue is 0, so I need to show that S is divisible by 2009.\n\nFirst, I should recall how to compute the sum of consecutive integers. The formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is (n/2)(first term + last term). Here, the first term is 2010, and the last term is 4018. The number of terms, n, is 4018 - 2010 + 1. Let me calculate that: 4018 - 2010 is 2008, so adding 1 gives 2009 terms. Oh, interesting, the number of terms is exactly 2009. That might be a clue.\n\nSo, S = (2009/2) * (2010 + 4018). Let me compute 2010 + 4018. That's 6028. So S = (2009 * 6028) / 2. Simplifying that, it's 2009 * 3014. Because 6028 divided by 2 is 3014. So S = 2009 * 3014. Now, since S is a multiple of 2009, when we take S modulo 2009, it should be 0. Because any multiple of 2009 divided by 2009 leaves a remainder of 0.\n\nWait, but maybe I need to check if there's a mistake here. Let me verify the number of terms again. The formula is last - first + 1. So 4018 - 2010 = 2008, plus 1 is 2009. That's correct. So the sum is indeed 2009 multiplied by the average of the first and last term. Since 2009 is the modulus, multiplying by it and then taking modulo 2009 would give 0. Therefore, the residue is 0.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another approach using properties of modular arithmetic. For example, each term in the sum can be considered modulo 2009. But since the sum has 2009 terms, each term could be congruent to some value modulo 2009. However, since 2009 is the modulus, adding 2009 terms each congruent to some residue would sum up to a multiple of 2009, hence 0 modulo 2009. But this seems less straightforward. The first approach using the arithmetic series formula seems more direct and correct.\n\nAnother check: Let's consider that 2009 is the modulus. If the sum S is 2009 multiplied by some integer, then S mod 2009 is 0. Since S = 2009 * 3014, then yes, S mod 2009 = 0. Therefore, the residue is indeed 0.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo compute the residue of the sum \\( S = 2010 + 2011 + \\cdots + 4018 \\) modulo 2009, we first observe that this is an arithmetic series with:\n\n- **First term**: \\( a = 2010 \\),\n- **Last term**: \\( l = 4018 \\),\n- **Number of terms**: \\( n = 4018 - 2010 + 1 = 2009 \\).\n\nThe formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is:\n\\[\nS = \\frac{n}{2} \\cdot (a + l).\n\\]\nSubstituting the values:\n\\[\nS = \\frac{2009}{2} \\cdot (2010 + 4018) = \\frac{2009}{2} \\cdot 6028 = 2009 \\cdot 3014.\n\\]\nThis shows \\( S = 2009 \\cdot 3014 \\), which is explicitly a multiple of 2009. \n\nBy definition of modular arithmetic, any integer multiple of 2009 is congruent to 0 modulo 2009. Therefore:\n\\[\nS \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2009}.\n\\]\nThis confirms that the residue of \\( S \\) modulo 2009 is indeed **0**.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown constant 'Finset.sum_Icc_eq_add_neg'\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, equality or iff proof expected\n  ?m.2498\ns : \u2115\nh\u2080 : s = \u2211 k \u2208 Finset.Icc 2010 4018, k\na : \u2115 := 2010\nl : \u2115 := 4018\nn : \u2115 := 4018 - 2010 + 1\nh\u2081 : n = 2009\n\u22a2 \u2211 k \u2208 Finset.Icc 2010 4018, k = n * (a + l) / 2\nno goals to be solved\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown constant 'Finset.sum_Icc_eq_add_neg'\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, equality or iff proof expected\n  ?m.2470\ns : \u2115\nh\u2080 : s = \u2211 k \u2208 Finset.Icc 2010 4018, k\nn : \u2115 := 4018 - 2010 + 1\nh\u2081 : n = 2009\n\u22a2 \u2211 k \u2208 Finset.Icc 2010 4018, k = n * (2010 + 4018) / 2\nno goals to be solved\nno goals to be solved\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown constant 'Finset.sum_Icc_eq_add_neg'\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, equality or iff proof expected\n  ?m.2498\ns : \u2115\nh\u2080 : s = \u2211 k \u2208 Finset.Icc 2010 4018, k\na : \u2115 := 2010\nl : \u2115 := 4018\nn : \u2115 := 4018 - 2010 + 1\nh\u2081 : n = 2009\n\u22a2 \u2211 k \u2208 Finset.Icc 2010 4018, k = n * (a + l) / 2\nno goals to be solved\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to show that the statement \"a and b are both even if and only if 8 divides a\u00b2 + b\u00b2\" is false. Hmm. Let me start by understanding what the original problem is asking. The user wants to prove that this biconditional statement isn't true. That means there are cases where one side is true but the other isn't.\n\nFirst, let's parse the statement. The \"iff\" (if and only if) means both directions need to hold for the statement to be true. So, the statement claims two things:\n\n1. If a and b are both even, then 8 divides a\u00b2 + b\u00b2.\n2. If 8 divides a\u00b2 + b\u00b2, then a and b are both even.\n\nTo show the entire statement is false, I need to find a counterexample where either one of these directions fails. That is, either there exist a and b both even but a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 isn't divisible by 8, or there exist a and b not both even (i.e., at least one is odd) but a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 is divisible by 8.\n\nWait, but the original theorem in the context was about the difference of squares of odd numbers being divisible by 8. Maybe that's related. Let me recall that theorem. It says that if a and b are odd, then a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 is divisible by 8. But here, the problem is about a\u00b2 + b\u00b2. Hmm. Maybe similar techniques apply.\n\nLet me first check the first direction: If a and b are both even, does 8 necessarily divide a\u00b2 + b\u00b2?\n\nSuppose a and b are even. Then a = 2m and b = 2n for integers m and n. Then a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = (2m)\u00b2 + (2n)\u00b2 = 4m\u00b2 + 4n\u00b2 = 4(m\u00b2 + n\u00b2). For this to be divisible by 8, m\u00b2 + n\u00b2 must be even, because 4 times an even number is 8 times some integer. So m\u00b2 + n\u00b2 needs to be even. But m and n can be any integers. Let's take m and n both even: m=2k, n=2l. Then m\u00b2 + n\u00b2 = 4k\u00b2 +4l\u00b2 =4(k\u00b2 + l\u00b2), which is divisible by 4. Then 4*(4(k\u00b2 + l\u00b2)) = 16(k\u00b2 + l\u00b2), which is divisible by 16, hence by 8. Wait, but if m and n are even, then a and b would be multiples of 4. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, if a and b are both even, then a=2m and b=2n. Then a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 =4m\u00b2 +4n\u00b2=4(m\u00b2 +n\u00b2). For this to be divisible by 8, m\u00b2 +n\u00b2 must be even. Because 4 times an even number is 8 times something. So m\u00b2 +n\u00b2 must be even. But m and n can be integers. Let's take m=1 and n=1. Then m\u00b2 +n\u00b2=2, which is even. So 4*2=8, which is divisible by 8. But if m=1 and n=2, then m\u00b2 +n\u00b2=1+4=5, which is odd. Then 4*5=20, which is not divisible by 8. Wait, but in this case, a=2*1=2 and b=2*2=4. So a=2 and b=4, both even. Then a\u00b2 + b\u00b2=4 +16=20, which is not divisible by 8. So here's a counterexample: a=2 and b=4. Both even, but a\u00b2 +b\u00b2=20, which is not divisible by 8. Therefore, the first direction of the biconditional is false. So the entire statement is false because one direction fails.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another direction. Let's check the other direction: If 8 divides a\u00b2 +b\u00b2, then a and b are both even. To disprove this, we need to find a case where 8 divides a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 but at least one of a or b is odd.\n\nWait, the original theorem was about the difference of squares of odd numbers being divisible by 8. Let's see. If a and b are both odd, then a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 is divisible by 8. But here, we have a\u00b2 +b\u00b2. Let's compute a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 when a and b are both odd. Let a=2m+1 and b=2n+1. Then a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 = (4m\u00b2 +4m +1) + (4n\u00b2 +4n +1) =4(m\u00b2 +m +n\u00b2 +n) +2. So this is 4k +2, where k is an integer. So 4k +2 is congruent to 2 mod 4, which is not divisible by 8. So if both a and b are odd, then a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 \u2261 2 mod 8. Therefore, 8 does not divide a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 in that case. So that's not helpful for the other direction.\n\nWait, but maybe if one is even and the other is odd. Let's take a even and b odd. Let a=2m and b=2n+1. Then a\u00b2 +b\u00b2=4m\u00b2 + (4n\u00b2 +4n +1)=4(m\u00b2 +n\u00b2 +n) +1. So this is 4k +1, which is 1 mod 4. So 4k +1 is not divisible by 8. Similarly, if a is odd and b even, same result. So the sum a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 when one is even and the other is odd is 1 mod 4, so not divisible by 8.\n\nWait, but then when is a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 divisible by 8? Let's see. If both a and b are even, then a=2m, b=2n. Then a\u00b2 +b\u00b2=4m\u00b2 +4n\u00b2=4(m\u00b2 +n\u00b2). For this to be divisible by 8, m\u00b2 +n\u00b2 must be even. So m\u00b2 and n\u00b2 must be both even or both odd. But squares are even if and only if the number itself is even. So m and n must be both even or both odd. Wait, but if m and n are both even, then m=2k, n=2l, so m\u00b2 +n\u00b2=4k\u00b2 +4l\u00b2=4(k\u00b2 +l\u00b2), which is divisible by 4. Then 4*(4(k\u00b2 +l\u00b2))=16(k\u00b2 +l\u00b2), which is divisible by 16. But if m and n are both odd, then m=2k+1, n=2l+1, so m\u00b2 +n\u00b2= (4k\u00b2 +4k +1)+(4l\u00b2 +4l +1)=4(k\u00b2 +k +l\u00b2 +l) +2=4*(something) +2. So m\u00b2 +n\u00b2 is even but not divisible by 4. Therefore, 4*(m\u00b2 +n\u00b2) would be divisible by 8 only if m\u00b2 +n\u00b2 is even. Wait, but if m and n are both even, then m\u00b2 +n\u00b2 is even (since even squared is even). If m and n are both odd, then m\u00b2 +n\u00b2 is even (since odd squared is odd, and odd + odd = even). So in both cases, m\u00b2 +n\u00b2 is even. Therefore, 4*(even) is 8*(something), so divisible by 8. Wait, but earlier when I took m=1 and n=2, which would correspond to a=2*1=2 and b=2*2=4, then m=1 (odd) and n=2 (even). Wait, but in that case, m and n are not both even or both odd. So m=1 (odd) and n=2 (even). Then m\u00b2 +n\u00b2=1 +4=5, which is odd. Therefore, 4*5=20, which is not divisible by 8. So that's the case where m and n are not both even or both odd. Therefore, when a and b are both even, but m and n (their halves) are not both even or both odd, then a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 is not divisible by 8. So that's a counterexample for the first direction.\n\nBut the problem is to show that the entire biconditional is false. So either direction can fail. We already have a counterexample for the forward direction: a=2, b=4 (both even), but a\u00b2 +b\u00b2=20, which is not divisible by 8. Therefore, the \"if\" part (left to right) is false. Hence, the entire statement is false.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a counterexample for the reverse direction. Suppose 8 divides a\u00b2 +b\u00b2, but a and b are not both even. Let's see. Suppose a is even and b is odd. Then as before, a\u00b2 +b\u00b2=4k +1, which is 1 mod 4, so not divisible by 8. If both are odd, then a\u00b2 +b\u00b2=2 mod 8, as earlier. So the only way a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 is divisible by 8 is if both a and b are even, but with the additional condition that their halves (m and n) are such that m\u00b2 +n\u00b2 is even. Wait, but if a and b are both even, then a=2m, b=2n, and a\u00b2 +b\u00b2=4(m\u00b2 +n\u00b2). For this to be divisible by 8, m\u00b2 +n\u00b2 must be even. Which happens when m and n are both even or both odd. So if m and n are both even, then m=2k, n=2l, so a=4k, b=4l, and a\u00b2 +b\u00b2=16(k\u00b2 +l\u00b2), which is divisible by 16, hence by 8. If m and n are both odd, then m=2k+1, n=2l+1, so a=2(2k+1)=4k+2, b=2(2l+1)=4l+2. Then a\u00b2 +b\u00b2=(4k+2)^2 + (4l+2)^2=16k\u00b2 +16k +4 +16l\u00b2 +16l +4=16(k\u00b2 +k +l\u00b2 +l) +8=8*(2(k\u00b2 +k +l\u00b2 +l) +1), which is divisible by 8. So in this case, when a and b are both even, but their halves m and n are both odd, then a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 is divisible by 8. But if m and n are not both even or both odd, then a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 is not divisible by 8. So the forward direction (both even implies 8 divides a\u00b2 +b\u00b2) is not always true. Hence, the biconditional fails.\n\nBut the problem is to show that the statement \"a and b are both even iff 8 divides a\u00b2 +b\u00b2\" is false. So we need to show that either the forward or reverse implication is false. The forward implication is false because there exist even a and b where a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 isn't divisible by 8 (like a=2, b=2: 4+4=8, which is divisible by 8. Wait, but that's a case where it works. Wait, but earlier when a=2 and b=4, which are both even, a\u00b2 +b\u00b2=4+16=20, which is not divisible by 8. So that's a counterexample for the forward direction. Therefore, the forward direction is not always true, hence the biconditional is false.\n\nAlternatively, the reverse direction: if 8 divides a\u00b2 +b\u00b2, then a and b are both even. Suppose we can find a case where 8 divides a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 but at least one of a or b is odd. But from earlier analysis, if one is even and the other is odd, a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 is 1 mod 4, which is not divisible by 8. If both are odd, a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 is 2 mod 8. So the only way 8 divides a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 is if both are even. Wait, but wait. Let me check. Suppose a=0 and b=0. Then a\u00b2 +b\u00b2=0, which is divisible by 8, and both are even. If a=4 and b=0, then 16 +0=16, divisible by 8. If a=2 and b=2, 4+4=8. If a=6 and b=2, 36 +4=40, which is divisible by 8. Wait, 40/8=5. Yes. But if a=2 and b=4, 4+16=20, which is not divisible by 8. So in some cases, even numbers give a sum divisible by 8, and others not. But according to the reverse direction, if 8 divides a\u00b2 +b\u00b2, then a and b must be both even. But from the analysis, when a and b are both even, sometimes the sum is divisible by 8, sometimes not. But the reverse direction says that whenever the sum is divisible by 8, then a and b must be even. Is that always true?\n\nWait, suppose 8 divides a\u00b2 +b\u00b2. Then a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 is even, so both a and b must be even or both odd. Because if one is even and the other odd, their squares sum to odd + even = odd, which is not divisible by 2, hence not by 8. But if both are odd, then a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 \u2261 1 +1 = 2 mod 8, which is not divisible by 8. Therefore, the only possibility for a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 to be divisible by 8 is that both a and b are even. So the reverse direction actually holds. Because if 8 divides a\u00b2 +b\u00b2, then both a and b must be even. Because if they were both odd, the sum is 2 mod 8, and if one is even and the other odd, the sum is 1 mod 4, which can't be divisible by 8. Therefore, the reverse direction is true. But the forward direction is not, because there are even a and b where the sum isn't divisible by 8. Therefore, the biconditional is false because the forward direction fails.\n\nSo the counterexample is: a=2 and b=4. Both even, but a\u00b2 +b\u00b2=20, which is not divisible by 8. Hence, the \"only if\" part (the forward direction) is false, making the entire biconditional statement false.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo show the statement \"a and b are both even if and only if 8 divides \\(a^2 + b^2\\)\" is false, we need to demonstrate that at least one direction of the biconditional fails. Here\u2019s how:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the biconditional\nThe statement claims two things:\n1. **If \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both even, then \\(8 \\mid a^2 + b^2\\).**  \n   *(Forward direction)*\n2. **If \\(8 \\mid a^2 + b^2\\), then \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both even.**  \n   *(Reverse direction)*\n\nTo disprove the biconditional, we only need to show that **one** of these directions is false.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Disprove the forward direction\n**Claim:** If \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both even, then \\(8 \\mid a^2 + b^2\\).  \n**Counterexample:** Let \\(a = 2\\) and \\(b = 4\\). Both are even.  \nCompute \\(a^2 + b^2 = 2^2 + 4^2 = 4 + 16 = 20\\).  \nSince \\(20\\) is **not divisible by 8**, the forward direction fails.  \n\n**Why this works:**  \nWhen \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are even, \\(a = 2m\\) and \\(b = 2n\\). Then \\(a^2 + b^2 = 4(m^2 + n^2)\\). For this to be divisible by \\(8\\), \\(m^2 + n^2\\) must be even. However, if \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are not both even or both odd (e.g., \\(m = 1\\), \\(n = 2\\)), \\(m^2 + n^2\\) becomes odd, making \\(a^2 + b^2\\) not divisible by \\(8\\).\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Verify the reverse direction (optional)\nFor completeness, we check the reverse direction:  \n**Claim:** If \\(8 \\mid a^2 + b^2\\), then \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both even.  \n**Analysis:**  \n- If one number is even and the other is odd, \\(a^2 + b^2\\) is odd (e.g., \\(1^2 + 2^2 = 1 + 4 = 5\\)), which cannot be divisible by \\(8\\).  \n- If both are odd, \\(a^2 + b^2 \\equiv 1 + 1 = 2 \\mod 8\\), which is not divisible by \\(8\\).  \n- Thus, the **only way** \\(8 \\mid a^2 + b^2\\) is if both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are even.  \nThis direction holds, but the forward direction\u2019s failure is sufficient to invalidate the entire biconditional.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\nThe statement is false because the forward direction fails: there exist even integers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) (e.g., \\(2\\) and \\(4\\)) where \\(a^2 + b^2\\) is not divisible by \\(8\\). This breaks the \"if and only if\" relationship.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. We need to find the x-coordinates where the graphs of y = x\u2074 and y = 5x\u00b2 - 6 intersect. The problem states that there are four points of intersection with x-coordinates \u00b1\u221am and \u00b1\u221an, where m > n, and we need to show that m - n equals 1.\n\nFirst, I remember that to find the intersection points of two graphs, we set their y-values equal to each other. So, setting x\u2074 equal to 5x\u00b2 - 6 should give us the equation we need to solve. Let me write that down:\n\nx\u2074 = 5x\u00b2 - 6\n\nHmm, this looks like a quartic equation, but maybe we can simplify it by substitution. If I let z = x\u00b2, then x\u2074 becomes z\u00b2. That substitution often helps in equations with even exponents. Let's try that:\n\nz\u00b2 = 5z - 6\n\nNow, rearranging the equation to standard quadratic form:\n\nz\u00b2 - 5z + 6 = 0\n\nWait, solving this quadratic equation for z should give us the possible values of z, which are x\u00b2. Let's factor the quadratic. Looking for two numbers that multiply to 6 and add up to -5. Those numbers are -2 and -3. So, factoring:\n\n(z - 2)(z - 3) = 0\n\nTherefore, z = 2 or z = 3. But since z = x\u00b2, we substitute back:\n\nFor z = 2: x\u00b2 = 2 \u2192 x = \u00b1\u221a2\n\nFor z = 3: x\u00b2 = 3 \u2192 x = \u00b1\u221a3\n\nSo the x-coordinates of the intersection points are \u00b1\u221a2 and \u00b1\u221a3. Here, m and n are 3 and 2 respectively because m > n. Therefore, m - n = 3 - 2 = 1.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The original problem says m > n, so m is 3 and n is 2. Their difference is indeed 1. That seems straightforward. But maybe I should verify by plugging the values back into the original equations to ensure they actually intersect at those points.\n\nTake x = \u221a2. Plugging into y = x\u2074: (\u221a2)^4 = (2)^2 = 4. Plugging into y = 5x\u00b2 -6: 5*(2) -6 = 10 -6 = 4. So yes, they match. Similarly for x = \u221a3: x\u2074 = (3)^2 = 9, and 5x\u00b2 -6 = 5*3 -6 = 15 -6 = 9. That checks out too. The negative roots would also work since x is squared in both equations. So all four points are valid intersections.\n\nTherefore, m is 3 and n is 2, so m - n = 1 as required.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo find where the graphs of \\( y = x^4 \\) and \\( y = 5x^2 - 6 \\) intersect, set the equations equal to each other:  \n\\[\nx^4 = 5x^2 - 6.\n\\]\nThis is a quartic equation, but substituting \\( z = x^2 \\) simplifies it to a quadratic:  \n\\[\nz^2 = 5z - 6 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad z^2 - 5z + 6 = 0.\n\\]\nFactoring the quadratic gives:  \n\\[\n(z - 2)(z - 3) = 0,\n\\]\nso \\( z = 2 \\) or \\( z = 3 \\). Since \\( z = x^2 \\), substitute back:  \n- For \\( z = 2 \\): \\( x^2 = 2 \\Rightarrow x = \\pm \\sqrt{2} \\).  \n- For \\( z = 3 \\): \\( x^2 = 3 \\Rightarrow x = \\pm \\sqrt{3} \\).  \n\nThus, the intersection points have \\( x \\)-coordinates \\( \\pm \\sqrt{2} \\) and \\( \\pm \\sqrt{3} \\). Here, \\( m = 3 \\) (the larger root) and \\( n = 2 \\) (the smaller root). Therefore, \\( m - n = 3 - 2 = 1 \\), as required.  \n\n**Verification**: Plugging \\( x = \\sqrt{2} \\) into both equations gives \\( y = 4 \\), and \\( x = \\sqrt{3} \\) gives \\( y = 9 \\), confirming the intersections. The symmetry of the equations ensures the negative roots also work. Hence, \\( m - n = 1 \\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'eq_or_eq_of_mul_eq_zero'\nunknown identifier 'eq_or_eq_of_mul_eq_zero'\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: type mismatch\n  h\u2085\nhas type\n  x ^ 4 = 5 * (x * x) -

A number is divisible by 20 if when you divide it by 20, there's no remainder. So, these numbers would be multiples of 20. The multiples of 20 are 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, and so on. But since we're looking between 15 and 85, I need to check which of these multiples fall into that interval.\n\nWait, the range is between 15 and 85. Does \"between\" include 15 and 85 themselves? The problem says \"between 15 and 85,\" which sometimes can be ambiguous. But in math problems, unless specified otherwise, usually \"between a and b\" includes a and b. But let's check the multiples of 20 in that range.\n\nStarting from the smallest multiple of 20 greater than 15. The first multiple is 20. Then the next one is 40, then 60, then 80. The next one after that would be 100, which is over 85, so that's out. So the multiples are 20, 40, 60, 80. That's four numbers. So that's the answer. But let me make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nWait, let me confirm each step. First, list all multiples of 20. The general form is 20k where k is a positive integer. So 20*1=20, 20*2=40, 20*3=60, 20*4=80, 20*5=100. Now, check which of these are between 15 and 85. 20 is 20, which is greater than 15 and less than 85. 40 is also in between. 60 is as well. 80 is exactly 80, which is less than 85. The next one, 100, is 100, which is way over 85. So yes, four numbers: 20, 40, 60, 80.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check if 85 is included. The problem says \"between 15 and 85.\" If 85 is excluded, then 80 is still included because 80 <85. If 85 is included, then 80 is still the last one. So either way, 80 is included. So the count remains 4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formulaic way to compute this. The number of integers divisible by n between a and b inclusive is given by floor(b/n) - floor((a-1)/n). Let me see if that applies here. Let's test that formula.\n\nHere, n=20, a=15, b=85. So floor(85/20) = floor(4.25) =4. floor((15-1)/20)=floor(14/20)=floor(0.7)=0. So 4-0=4. That gives 4, which matches our previous count. So that formula works here. Therefore, the answer is indeed 4.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: the first multiple of 20 in the range is 20. The last multiple is 80. The number of terms in the arithmetic sequence starting at 20, ending at 80, with common difference 20. The formula for the number of terms is ((last term - first term)/common difference) +1. So ((80-20)/20)+1= (60/20)+1=3+1=4. That also gives 4. So all methods confirm that there are 4 numbers. Therefore, the answer is 4.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo determine how many integers between 15 and 85 are divisible by 20, we first identify the multiples of 20 within this range. A number is divisible by 20 if it can be expressed as \\(20k\\), where \\(k\\) is a positive integer. \n\nStarting with the smallest multiple of 20 greater than 15:\n- \\(20 \\times 1 = 20\\)\n- \\(20 \\times 2 = 40\\)\n- \\(20 \\times 3 = 60\\)\n- \\(20 \\times 4 = 80\\)\n\nThe next multiple, \\(20 \\times 5 = 100\\), exceeds 85 and is outside the range. Thus, the valid multiples are \\(20, 40, 60, 80\\). \n\nTo confirm, we can use the formula for counting integers divisible by \\(n\\) in a range \\([a, b]\\):\n\\[\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{b}{n} \\right\\rfloor - \\left\\lfloor \\frac{a-1}{n} \\right\\rfloor\n\\]\nHere, \\(n = 20\\), \\(a = 15\\), and \\(b = 85\\):\n\\[\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{85}{20} \\right\\rfloor - \\left\\lfloor \\frac{14}{20} \\right\\rfloor = 4 - 0 = 4\n\\]\nThis confirms there are **4 integers** (20, 40, 60, 80) between 15 and 85 divisible by 20.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the remainder when the sum of the numbers from 2000 to 2006 is divided by 7. The problem also mentions that the remainder should be 0, so I need to show that this sum is divisible by 7. \n\nFirst, let me think about how to approach this. Adding all those numbers directly might be tedious, and then dividing by 7 could take time. Maybe there's a smarter way using properties of numbers and divisibility by 7. \n\nWait, the context provided earlier talks about a theorem for divisibility by 7. The theorem states that a number is divisible by 7 if and only if the sum of each digit multiplied by 3 to the power of its position (starting from the ones place) is divisible by 7. But here, instead of checking individual numbers, I need to check the sum of several numbers. Hmm, maybe I can apply the theorem to each number first and then add their contributions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern in the numbers from 2000 to 2006. Let's list them out: 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006. These are seven consecutive numbers. The sum of consecutive numbers can sometimes be simplified. For example, the sum of consecutive numbers from a to a+6 is 7a + 21, since there are 7 terms, each increasing by 1. Wait, let's check that. The sum of numbers from a to a+n-1 is n*a + n(n-1)/2. So here, n=7, so sum =7a + 7*6/2=7a+21. So the sum would be 7a +21. Then, 7a is obviously divisible by 7, and 21 is also divisible by 7. So the total sum would be 7(a+3), which is divisible by 7. Therefore, the remainder should be 0. \n\nBut wait, let me confirm this with actual numbers. Let's take a=2000. Then the sum is 2000+2001+2002+2003+2004+2005+2006. Let's compute this. Adding them pairwise: 2000+2006=4006, 2001+2005=4006, 2002+2004=4006, and the middle term is 2003. So total sum is 4006*3 +2003. Let's compute 4006*3: 4000*3=12000, 6*3=18, so 12000+18=12018. Then add 2003: 12018+2003=14021. Now, divide 14021 by 7. Let's see: 7*2000=14000, so 14021-14000=21. 21 divided by 7 is 3. So 14021=7*2003, which is divisible by 7. So the remainder is indeed 0. \n\nBut maybe there's another way using modular arithmetic. Each number can be considered modulo 7. Let's compute each term mod 7 and then sum them up. Let's find 2000 mod 7 first. To find 2000 divided by 7: 7*285=1995, so 2000-1995=5. So 2000 \u22615 mod7. Then 2001\u22616 mod7, 2002\u22610 mod7 (since 2002-1995=7, which is 0 mod7), 2003\u22611 mod7, 2004\u22612 mod7, 2005\u22613 mod7, 2006\u22614 mod7. Now sum these remainders: 5+6+0+1+2+3+4=21. 21 mod7 is 0. So the total sum is 0 mod7, hence divisible by7. \n\nAlternatively, using the theorem from the context: For each number, compute the sum of its digits multiplied by 3^i, where i is the position (starting from 0 at the ones place). Then sum all those for each number and check divisibility by7. But that seems more complicated for this problem since we have multiple numbers. The previous methods seem simpler. \n\nBut the problem asks to show that the remainder is 0. Both methods\u2014summing consecutive numbers and modular arithmetic\u2014confirm this. The consecutive numbers approach uses the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence, which in this case simplifies to a multiple of7. The modular approach directly computes each term's remainder and sums them, resulting in a multiple of7. Either way, the conclusion is the same. \n\nSo the key steps are: recognize the numbers are consecutive, use the sum formula or modular arithmetic to show the total sum is a multiple of7. Therefore, the remainder is0.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo find the remainder when \\(2000 + 2001 + 2002 + 2003 + 2004 + 2005 + 2006\\) is divided by \\(7\\), observe that these are seven consecutive integers. The sum of \\(n\\) consecutive integers starting at \\(a\\) is given by \\(n \\cdot a + \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\\). Here, \\(n = 7\\) and \\(a = 2000\\), so:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum} = 7 \\cdot 2000 + \\frac{7 \\cdot 6}{2} = 14000 + 21 = 14021.\n\\]\n\nSince \\(14021 = 7 \\cdot 2003\\), the sum is clearly divisible by \\(7\\), leaving a remainder of \\(0\\).\n\n**Alternative approach using modular arithmetic:**  \nCompute each term modulo \\(7\\):\n- \\(2000 \\equiv 5 \\mod 7\\) (since \\(2000 - 7 \\cdot 285 = 5\\)),\n- \\(2001 \\equiv 6 \\mod 7\\),\n- \\(2002 \\equiv 0 \\mod 7\\),\n- \\(2003 \\equiv 1 \\mod 7\\),\n- \\(2004 \\equiv 2 \\mod 7\\),\n- \\(2005 \\equiv 3 \\mod 7\\),\n- \\(2006 \\equiv 4 \\mod 7\\).\n\nSumming these remainders:  \n\\(5 + 6 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 21\\).  \nSince \\(21 \\equiv 0 \\mod 7\\), the total sum is divisible by \\(7\\). Thus, the remainder is \\(0\\).",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the sum of the units digits of all the multiples of 3 between 0 and 50, and show that it's 78. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, what are the multiples of 3 between 0 and 50? Well, multiples of 3 are numbers like 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, ..., up to the largest one less than 50. Let me list them out. Starting from 0: 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48. Wait, 48 is 3*16=48, and the next one would be 51, which is over 50, so stop at 48.\n\nNow, for each of these numbers, I need to take the units digit. The units digit is the last digit of the number. For example, 12 has units digit 2, 15 has 5, etc. Then sum all those units digits.\n\nLet me list all the multiples and their units digits:\n\n0 \u2192 0\n\n3 \u2192 3\n\n6 \u2192 6\n\n9 \u2192 9\n\n12 \u2192 2\n\n15 \u2192 5\n\n18 \u2192 8\n\n21 \u2192 1\n\n24 \u2192 4\n\n27 \u2192 7\n\n30 \u2192 0\n\n33 \u2192 3\n\n36 \u2192 6\n\n39 \u2192 9\n\n42 \u2192 2\n\n45 \u2192 5\n\n48 \u2192 8\n\nNow, let's add these up.

So that's the answer. But maybe there's a smarter way to do this without listing all the numbers, especially if the range was larger. Let me think if there's a pattern or a formula.\n\nLooking at the units digits: 0,3,6,9,2,5,8,1,4,7,0,3,6,9,2,5,8. Hmm. The units digits cycle every 10 numbers? Let's see. The multiples of 3 in each ten's place:\n\n0-10: 0,3,6,9\n\n10-20: 12,15,18\n\n20-30: 21,24,27\n\n30-40: 30,33,36,39\n\n40-50: 42,45,48\n\nWait, but 30 is in 30-40. So each ten's group has 3 or 4 multiples. The units digits in each group:\n\n0-10: 0,3,6,9 \u2192 sum 0+3+6+9=18\n\n10-20: 2,5,8 \u2192 sum 2+5+8=15\n\n20-30:1,4,7 \u2192 sum 1+4+7=12\n\n30-40:0,3,6,9 \u2192 sum 18 again\n\n40-50:2,5,8 \u2192 sum 15\n\nAdding these: 18 +15 +12 +18 +15 = 78. Oh, that's the same as before. So breaking it into decades (0-10, 10-20, etc.) and summing each group's units digits gives the same total. That seems more efficient.\n\nBut why does this pattern happen? Let's see. The multiples of 3 in each decade (like 0-10, 10-20, etc.) have units digits that form a sequence. For example, in 0-10, the units digits are 0,3,6,9. Then in 10-20, since we start at 12, the units digits are 2,5,8. Then 21,24,27 gives 1,4,7. Then 30,33,36,39 gives 0,3,6,9 again, and 42,45,48 gives 2,5,8. So the pattern repeats every three decades? Wait, 0-10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-40, 40-50. The units digits cycles through 0,3,6,9; then 2,5,8; then 1,4,7; then back to 0,3,6,9, etc. So every three decades, the pattern of units digits repeats.\n\nBut in this case, from 0-50, we have five decades. The first three decades (0-10,10-20,20-30) have sums 18,15,12. Then the next two (30-40,40-50) repeat the first two sums: 18 and 15. So total sum is 18+15+12+18+15=78.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mathematical formula. The sum of units digits for multiples of 3 in each decade can be determined by the starting number. For example, in 0-10, starting at 0, the units digits are 0,3,6,9. The sum is 0+3+6+9=18. Then in 10-20, starting at 12 (which is 10+2), the units digits increase by 3 each time: 12\u21922, 15\u21925, 18\u21928. So 2,5,8 sum to 15. Similarly, 21\u21921,24\u21924,27\u21927 sum to 12. Then 30\u21920,33\u21923,36\u21926,39\u21929 sum to 18 again. Then 42\u21922,45\u21925,48\u21928 sum to 15. So the pattern is 18,15,12,18,15. Adding those gives 78.\n\nBut is there a way to generalize this without listing? Let's think. Each decade (0-10,10-20, etc.) can have 3 or 4 multiples of 3. For example, 0-10 has 0,3,6,9: four numbers. 10-20 has 12,15,18: three numbers. 20-30 has 21,24,27: three. 30-40 has 30,33,36,39: four. 40-50 has 42,45,48: three. So the number of multiples alternates between 4 and 3 depending on the decade. But the units digits in each set form a sequence that cycles every three decades. The sum for each group of three decades would be 18+15+12=45, and then the next two decades repeat the first two sums (18+15=33), totaling 45+33=78.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a cycle of 30 numbers where the units digits repeat their pattern. Since 3 and 10 are coprime, the units digits cycle every 10 multiples? Wait, 3*10=30, which ends with 0, then 3*11=33 (units digit 3), 3*12=36 (6), etc. So the units digits cycle every 10 multiples. Wait, let's check:\n\nMultiples of 3:\n\n0 (0), 3 (3), 6 (6), 9 (9), 12 (2), 15 (5), 18 (8), 21 (1), 24 (4), 27 (7), 30 (0), 33 (3), 36 (6), 39 (9), 42 (2), 45 (5), 48 (8), 51 (1), etc.\n\nSo the units digits cycle every 10 multiples: 0,3,6,9,2,5,8,1,4,7, then repeats. So the cycle length is 10. But in our case, the multiples go up to 48, which is 3*16. So there are 17 multiples (from 0 to 48 inclusive). Wait, 0 is the 0th multiple, then 3 is 1st, ..., 48 is 16th. So 17 numbers. But the cycle of units digits is every 10 numbers. So from 0 to 30 (which is 10 multiples: 0 to 30 inclusive, which is 10 numbers: 0,3,6,9,12,15,18,21,24,27,30. Wait, that's 11 numbers. Hmm, maybe my cycle idea is off.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the units digits cycle every 10 numbers in the multiples of 3. Let's see:\n\nMultiples of 3: 0,3,6,9,12,15,18,21,24,27,30,33,36,39,42,45,48,...\n\nUnits digits: 0,3,6,9,2,5,8,1,4,7,0,3,6,9,2,5,8,...\n\nSo starting from 0, the units digits cycle through 0,3,6,9,2,5,8,1,4,7, then back to 0, etc. So the cycle length is 10. Each cycle of 10 multiples has units digits summing to 0+3+6+9+2+5+8+1+4+7=45.\n\nBut in our problem, we have multiples from 0 to 48, which is 16 multiples (since 48=3*16). Wait, but 0 is included, so total numbers are 17. Wait, 0 to 48 inclusive: 0,3,6,9,12,15,18,21,24,27,30,33,36,39,42,45,48. That's 17 numbers. So how many full cycles of 10 are there? Let's see: 17 numbers. The first 10 numbers (0 to 27) form one full cycle, sum 45. Then the next 7 numbers (30,33,36,39,42,45,48) have units digits 0,3,6,9,2,5,8. Their sum is 0+3+6+9+2+5+8=33. So total sum would be 45+33=78. That matches the answer.\n\nSo the key insight is that the units digits of multiples of 3 repeat every 10 multiples, forming a cycle. Each full cycle sums to 45. Since there are 17 multiples in total (from 0 to 48), that's one full cycle (10 numbers) and a partial cycle of 7 numbers. The partial cycle's units digits sum to 33. Adding them gives 45+33=78.\n\nBut wait, let me check the count again. From 0 to 48 inclusive, how many multiples of 3 are there? The nth multiple is 3(n-1). Wait, 0 is the 0th multiple, 3 is the 1st, ..., 48 is the 16th. So total 17 numbers. So first 10 multiples (0 to 27) sum to 45, then the next 7 (30 to 48) sum to 33. Total 78.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cycle is every 10 numbers, but starting from 0. So each cycle of 10 multiples contributes 45 to the sum. Then, for the remaining multiples, take their units digits from the start of the cycle.\n\nThis approach avoids listing all numbers and instead uses the repeating pattern. That's more efficient, especially for larger ranges.\n\nSo the proof would involve:\n\n1. Identifying all multiples of 3 between 0 and 50.\n\n2. Noting that the units digits of these multiples repeat every 10 numbers, forming a cycle.\n\n3. Calculating the sum of one full cycle (0 to 27) as 45.\n\n4. Determining the remaining numbers (30 to 48) and their units digits sum to 33.\n\n5. Adding both parts to get 78.\n\nThis method ensures accuracy without manually adding each term, leveraging the cyclical nature of units digits in multiples of 3.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo find the sum of the units digits of all multiples of 3 between 0 and 50, observe the following:\n\n1. **List the multiples of 3 in the range**:  \n   The multiples are:  \n   \\(0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48\\).  \n\n2. **Extract the units digits**:  \n   The units digits of these numbers are:  \n   \\(0, 3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8, 1, 4, 7, 0, 3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8\\).  \n\n3. **Identify the repeating pattern**:  \n   The units digits of multiples of 3 repeat every 10 numbers in the sequence:  \n   \\(0, 3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8, 1, 4, 7\\).  \n   This cycle sums to \\(0 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 2 + 5 + 8 + 1 + 4 + 7 = 45\\).  \n\n4. **Apply the pattern to the range**:  \n   - The first 10 multiples (0 to 27) form a complete cycle, contributing \\(45\\).  \n   - The remaining 7 multiples (30 to 48) have units digits \\(0, 3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8\\), summing to \\(0 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 2 + 5 + 8 = 33\\).  \n\n5. **Total sum**:  \n   Combine the two parts:  \n   \\(45 + 33 = 78\\).  \n\nThus, the sum of the units digits of all multiples of 3 between 0 and 50 is **78**.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is to find the remainder when 5 raised to the 999,999th power is divided by 7, and show that it's 6. Hmm. Alright, so I need to compute 5^999,999 mod 7. \n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with exponents modulo a number, modular arithmetic properties can simplify things. Maybe there's a pattern or cycle in the powers of 5 modulo 7. Let me check that.\n\nLet's start by calculating the first few powers of 5 modulo 7 and see if there's a repeating pattern. \n\n5^1 mod 7 is 5. \n\n5^2 is 25, and 25 divided by 7 is 3 with a remainder of 4, so 25 mod 7 is 4.\n\n5^3 would be 5^2 * 5, which is 4 * 5 = 20. 20 mod 7 is 6, since 7*2=14, 20-14=6.\n\n5^4 is 5^3 *5 = 6*5=30. 30 mod 7: 7*4=28, so remainder 2.\n\n5^5 is 2*5=10, which mod 7 is 3.\n\n5^6 is 3*5=15 mod 7, which is 1. \n\nWait, 15 divided by 7 is 2 with remainder 1. So 5^6 mod7=1. \n\nOh, interesting. So after the 6th power, it cycles back to 1. Then 5^7 would be 5^6 *5 mod7=1*5=5, which is the same as 5^1. So the cycle length here is 6. That means the powers of 5 modulo 7 repeat every 6 exponents. \n\nSo the cycle is: 5,4,6,2,3,1, then repeats. So the period is 6. \n\nTherefore, to find 5^999,999 mod7, we can find the exponent modulo 6, since the cycle repeats every 6. \n\nSo let's compute 999,999 divided by 6. Let's see, 6*166,666=999,996. So 999,999 - 999,996 =3. So 999,999 mod6 is 3. \n\nWait, but wait: 999,999 divided by 6. Let me check that again. 6*166,666 is 999,996. Then 999,996 +3=999,999. So the remainder is 3. Therefore, 999,999 \u22613 mod6. \n\nTherefore, 5^999,999 mod7 is the same as 5^3 mod7. Because the cycle length is 6, so exponent 999,999 is 6*166,666 +3, so 5^(6k+3) mod7= (5^6)^k *5^3 mod7. Since 5^6 mod7=1, this becomes 1^k *5^3 mod7=5^3 mod7=6. \n\nTherefore, the remainder is 6. \n\nWait, but let me verify that step again. If the cycle is 6, then exponents repeat every 6. So 5^1 mod7=5, 5^2=4, 5^3=6, 5^4=2, 5^5=3, 5^6=1, then 5^7=5 again. So yes, every 6 exponents. So 5^(n) mod7 is the same as 5^(n mod6) mod7. But wait, only when n mod6 is not zero. If n mod6 is zero, then it's 1. So in general, 5^(6k + r) mod7 = (5^6)^k *5^r mod7 =1^k *5^r mod7=5^r mod7. \n\nSo since 999,999 divided by 6 gives a remainder of 3, then 5^999,999 mod7=5^3 mod7=6. \n\nTherefore, the remainder is 6. That matches the problem's assertion. \n\nAlternatively, using Euler's theorem. Since 7 is prime, \u03c6(7)=6. So 5^6 \u22611 mod7. Then 5^6k \u22611^k=1 mod7. Then 5^(6k + r)=1*5^r mod7. So again, same result. \n\nSo the key steps are: find the cycle length of 5 modulo7, which is 6, then reduce the exponent modulo6, compute 5^3 mod7=6. \n\nTherefore, the remainder is 6.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo find the remainder when \\(5^{999,999}\\) is divided by 7, we use modular arithmetic. First, observe the pattern in the powers of 5 modulo 7:\n\n- \\(5^1 \\equiv 5 \\mod 7\\)\n- \\(5^2 \\equiv 25 \\equiv 4 \\mod 7\\)\n- \\(5^3 \\equiv 5 \\cdot 4 \\equiv 20 \\equiv 6 \\mod 7\\)\n- \\(5^4 \\equiv 5 \\cdot 6 \\equiv 30 \\equiv 2 \\mod 7\\)\n- \\(5^5 \\equiv 5 \\cdot 2 \\equiv 10 \\equiv 3 \\mod 7\\)\n- \\(5^6 \\equiv 5 \\cdot 3 \\equiv 15 \\equiv 1 \\mod 7\\)\n\nHere, \\(5^6 \\equiv 1 \\mod 7\\), showing that the powers of 5 repeat every 6 steps. This periodicity means \\(5^{k} \\mod 7\\) depends only on \\(k \\mod 6\\). \n\nNext, compute \\(999,999 \\mod 6\\):\n- \\(999,999 \\div 6 = 166,666\\) with a remainder of \\(3\\) (since \\(6 \\times 166,666 = 999,996\\), and \\(999,999 - 999,996 = 3\\)).\n\nThus, \\(5^{999,999} \\equiv 5^3 \\mod 7\\). From the earlier pattern, \\(5^3 \\equiv 6 \\mod 7\\). Therefore, the remainder when \\(5^{999,999}\\) is divided by 7 is **6**.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to find all \"nice\" numbers in the set {2010, 2011, ..., 2019}, where a number n is nice if there exists a positive integer m with exactly four positive divisors such that the sum of those four divisors equals n. Then, we need to sum all such nice numbers and show the total is 2016.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what numbers m with exactly four divisors look like. From number theory, a number has exactly four divisors if and only if it is either the product of two distinct prime numbers (i.e., m = p*q, where p and q are distinct primes) or it is a cube of a prime (m = p^3). These are the two cases because the number of divisors function, d(m), for m = p^a * q^b * ... is (a+1)(b+1)... So, for four divisors, the possibilities are (3+1) which would be a cube of a prime, or (1+1)(1+1) which is two distinct primes multiplied together.\n\nSo, m can be either p^3 or p*q. Now, for each of these forms, we need to compute the sum of their divisors and see which n's in the given range can be expressed as such sums.\n\nLet's start with the first case: m = p*q, where p and q are distinct primes. The divisors of m are 1, p, q, and pq. So the sum of the divisors is 1 + p + q + pq. Let's denote this sum as S1 = 1 + p + q + pq.\n\nThe second case is m = p^3. The divisors here are 1, p, p^2, p^3. The sum of divisors is S2 = 1 + p + p^2 + p^3.\n\nOur task is to find all n between 2010 and 2019 inclusive such that n equals either S1 or S2 for some primes p and q (with p \u2260 q in the first case).\n\nSo, we need to check for each n in {2010, ..., 2019} whether it can be written as S1 or S2.\n\nFirst, let's handle the S1 case: n = 1 + p + q + pq. This can be rewritten as n = (p + 1)(q + 1) - 1. Wait, let's see: (p+1)(q+1) = pq + p + q + 1, so subtracting 1 gives pq + p + q, which is S1 - 1. Wait, no. Wait, S1 is 1 + p + q + pq, so (p+1)(q+1) = pq + p + q + 1 = S1. So actually, S1 = (p+1)(q+1). Therefore, n = (p+1)(q+1). So for m = p*q, the sum of divisors S1 is (p+1)(q+1). Therefore, n must be equal to (p+1)(q+1). So, for each n in the range, we need to check if n can be expressed as the product of two integers greater than 1 (since p and q are primes, so p+1 and q+1 are at least 3 and 2, but since p and q are primes, p+1 and q+1 would be even if p is odd, which all primes except 2 are. Wait, but p and q can be 2. Let's think. For example, if p=2, then p+1=3; if p=3, p+1=4, etc. So, (p+1) and (q+1) are integers greater than 2 and 3, depending on the primes. So, n must be a product of two integers a and b where a = p+1, b = q+1, with p and q primes. Therefore, to find n in the range 2010-2019 that can be written as a product of two integers a and b (a \u2264 b) such that a-1 and b-1 are primes.\n\nSimilarly, for the S2 case: n = 1 + p + p^2 + p^3. Let's see if we can factor this. The sum of a geometric series: 1 + p + p^2 + p^3 = (p^4 - 1)/(p - 1) = (p^2 + 1)(p + 1). Wait, but that's only if p \u2260 1. Let me check: (p^4 -1) factors as (p^2 -1)(p^2 +1) = (p-1)(p+1)(p^2 +1). So, (p^4 -1)/(p-1) = (p^3 + p^2 + p +1). Wait, but 1 + p + p^2 + p^3 is indeed (p^4 -1)/(p-1). So, for example, if p=2, then S2=1+2+4+8=15. For p=3, S2=1+3+9+27=40. For p=5, 1+5+25+125=156. For larger primes, this sum increases rapidly. So, perhaps for primes larger than, say, 10, the sum S2 would be over 2010? Let's check. Let's take p=10, but p must be prime. Let's take p=13: 1+13+169+2197=1+13=14, 14+169=183, 183+2197=2380. That's already 2380, which is above 2019. So maybe primes like 11: 1+11+121+1331=1+11=12, 12+121=133, 133+1331=1464. Still below 2010. Next prime is 13, which we saw gives 2380. So, the S2 sums for primes p would be 15 (p=2), 40 (p=3), 156 (p=5), 400 (p=7), 1464 (p=11), 2380 (p=13), etc. So in our range 2010-2019, the only possible S2 sum would be for p=11, which gives 1464, which is below 2010, and p=13 gives 2380, which is above. So, perhaps there are no S2 cases in our range. Therefore, maybe all nice numbers in this range come from the S1 case, i.e., m being the product of two distinct primes.\n\nTherefore, we can focus on the S1 case: n = (p+1)(q+1), where p and q are distinct primes.\n\nSo, our task reduces to checking which numbers between 2010 and 2019 can be expressed as the product of two integers a and b, where a = p+1, b = q+1, and p and q are primes. Then, we need to find all such n and sum them.\n\nSo, first, let's list all numbers from 2010 to 2019 inclusive: 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019.\n\nFor each of these numbers, check if they can be written as a product of two integers a and b (a \u2264 b) such that a-1 and b-1 are primes.\n\nAlternatively, since n = (p+1)(q+1), we can factor n into two factors and check if both factors minus one are primes.\n\nSo, for each n in the range, we need to find all possible factor pairs (a, b) where a \u2264 b and a*b = n, then check if (a-1) and (b-1) are primes. If at least one such pair exists, then n is nice.\n\nSo, let's go through each number:\n\n1. 2010:\nFactor pairs of 2010. Let's find factors a \u2264 b such that a*b=2010. The square root of 2010 is approx 44.8, so factors up to 45.\n\nPossible factor pairs:\n1\u00d72010, 2\u00d71005, 3\u00d7670, 5\u00d7402, 6\u00d7335, 10\u00d7201, 15\u00d7134, 30\u00d767, etc.\n\nCheck each pair:\n\n- For a=2, b=1005: a-1=1 (not prime), so discard.\n- a=3, b=670: a-1=2 (prime), b-1=669. Check if 669 is prime. 669 \u00f7 3=223, so 669=3\u00d7223, not prime.\n- a=5, b=402: a-1=4 (not prime).\n- a=6, b=335: a-1=5 (prime), b-1=334. 334 is even, so not prime.\n- a=10, b=201: a-1=9 (not prime).\n- a=15, b=134: a-1=14 (not prime).\n- a=30, b=67: a-1=29 (prime), b-1=66 (not prime).\nSo none of these pairs work. Therefore, 2010 is not nice.\n\n2. 2011:\n2011 is a prime number (I recall that 2011 is prime). So its only factors are 1 and 2011. Then, a=1 and b=2011. But a-1=0 (not prime), so no. Hence, 2011 is not nice.\n\n3. 2012:\nFactor pairs of 2012. Let's see: 2012 \u00f7 2=1006, so 2\u00d71006. Then 4\u00d7503, etc.\n\nCheck:\n\n- a=2, b=1006: a-1=1 (not prime).\n- a=4, b=503: a-1=3 (prime), b-1=502. 502 is even, not prime.\n- Next factors: 2012 is even, so other factors would be 2\u00d71006, 4\u00d7503. 503 is a prime? Let's check. 503 \u00f7 3=167.666, not integer. 503 \u00f7 5=100.6, no. Up to sqrt(503)\u224822.4. Check primes up to 23: 2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23. 503 \u00f7 7=71.857\u2026 no. 503 \u00f7 11=45.727\u2026 no. 503 \u00f7 13=38.69\u2026 no. 17: 503 \u00f717\u224829.58. 19: 503 \u00f719\u224826.47. 23: 503 \u00f723\u224821.86. So 503 is prime. Therefore, 503 is prime. So a=4, b=503: a-1=3 (prime), b-1=502 (not prime). No good.\n\nNext factor pair: 2012= 2\u00d72\u00d7503. So other factors? 2\u00d72=4, 2\u00d7503=1006. So no other factors. So no valid pairs. Hence, 2012 is not nice.\n\n4. 2013:\nFactor pairs of 2013. Let's check divisibility. 2+0+1+3=6, which is divisible by 3, so 2013 \u00f73=671. Then 3\u00d7671. Check if 671 is prime. 671 \u00f711=61 (11\u00d761=671). So 2013=3\u00d711\u00d761. So factor pairs:\n\n1\u00d72013, 3\u00d7671, 11\u00d7183, 33\u00d761.\n\nCheck each:\n\n- a=3, b=671: a-1=2 (prime), b-1=670 (even, not prime).\n- a=11, b=183: a-1=10 (not prime).\n- a=33, b=61: a-1=32 (not prime), b-1=60 (not prime).\nSo no valid pairs. Hence, 2013 is not nice.\n\n5. 2014:\nFactor pairs of 2014. Since it's even, 2\u00d71007. Then check 1007: 1007 \u00f719=53 (19\u00d753=1007). So 2014=2\u00d719\u00d753. Factor pairs:\n\n1\u00d72014, 2\u00d71007, 19\u00d7106, 38\u00d753.\n\nCheck:\n\n- a=2, b=1007: a-1=1 (not prime).\n- a=19, b=106: a-1=18 (not prime).\n- a=38, b=53: a-1=37 (prime), b-1=52 (not prime).\nSo no valid pairs. Hence, 2014 is not nice.\n\n6. 2015:\nFactor pairs of 2015. Ends with 5, so divisible by 5: 5\u00d7403. 403 \u00f713=31 (13\u00d731=403). So 2015=5\u00d713\u00d731. Factor pairs:\n\n1\u00d72015, 5\u00d7403, 13\u00d7155, 31\u00d765.\n\nCheck:\n\n- a=5, b=403: a-1=4 (not prime).\n- a=13, b=155: a-1=12 (not prime).\n- a=31, b=65: a-1=30 (not prime).\nSo no valid pairs. Hence, 2015 is not nice.\n\n7. 2016:\nNow, 2016. Let's factorize 2016. Known to be a highly composite number. 2016 = 2^5 * 3^2 * 7. So its factors are numerous. Let's list possible factor pairs:\n\nPossible pairs: 1\u00d72016, 2\u00d71008, 3\u00d7672, 4\u00d7504, 6\u00d7336, 7\u00d7288, 8\u00d7252, 9\u00d7224, 12\u00d7168, 14\u00d7144, 16\u00d7126, 18\u00d7112, 21\u00d796, 24\u00d784, 28\u00d772, 32\u00d763, 36\u00d756, 42\u00d748.\n\nNow, check each pair to see if a-1 and b-1 are primes.\n\nStart with a=2, b=1008: a-1=1 (not prime).\n\na=3, b=672: a-1=2 (prime), b-1=671. Check if 671 is prime. 671 \u00f711=61 (11\u00d761=671). So 671 is composite. So no.\n\na=4, b=504: a-1=3 (prime), b-1=503. Check if 503 is prime. Earlier, we saw 503 is prime. So yes! So here, a=4, b=504. Then p = a-1=3 (prime), q = b-1=503 (prime). Therefore, m = p*q = 3*503=1509. The sum of divisors is (3+1)(503+1)=4*504=2016. Therefore, 2016 is a nice number.\n\nBut let's check other pairs to see if there are more possibilities.\n\na=6, b=336: a-1=5 (prime), b-1=335. Check 335: ends with 5, divisible by 5. 335=5\u00d767. Not prime.\n\na=7, b=288: a-1=6 (not prime).\n\na=8, b=252: a-1=7 (prime), b-1=251. Check if 251 is prime. 251 is a prime number. So p=7, q=251. Then m=7*251=1757. Sum of divisors is (7+1)(251+1)=8*252=2016. So another valid pair. But since we already found one, 2016 is nice regardless.\n\nContinuing:\n\na=9, b=224: a-1=8 (not prime).\n\na=12, b=168: a-1=11 (prime), b-1=167 (prime). So p=11, q=167. m=11*167=1837. Sum is (11+1)(167+1)=12*168=2016. Another valid pair.\n\nSimilarly, a=14, b=144: a-1=13 (prime), b-1=143. 143=11\u00d713, not prime.\n\na=16, b=126: a-1=15 (not prime).\n\na=18, b=112: a-1=17 (prime), b-1=111. 111=3\u00d737, not prime.\n\na=21, b=96: a-1=20 (not prime).\n\na=24, b=84: a-1=23 (prime), b-1=83 (prime). So p=23, q=83. m=23*83=1909. Sum is (23+1)(83+1)=24*84=2016.\n\na=28, b=72: a-1=27 (not prime).\n\na=32, b=63: a-1=31 (prime), b-1=62 (not prime).\n\na=36, b=56: a-1=35 (not prime).\n\na=42, b=48: a-1=41 (prime), b-1=47 (prime). So p=41, q=47. m=41*47=1927. Sum is (41+1)(47+1)=42*48=2016.\n\nSo multiple factor pairs for 2016 lead to valid primes p and q, hence 2016 is nice.\n\n8. 2017:\n2017 is a prime number (I recall that 2017 is a prime). So factors are 1 and 2017. Then a=1, b=2017: a-1=0 (not prime). So no. Hence, 2017 is not nice.\n\n9. 2018:\nFactor pairs of 2018. Even, so 2\u00d71009. 1009 is a prime (since it's not divisible by 2,3,5,7, etc. up to sqrt(1009)\u224831.8). So factors are 2\u00d71009.\n\nCheck a=2, b=1009: a-1=1 (not prime). No other factors. Hence, 2018 is not nice.\n\n10. 2019:\nFactor pairs of 2019. Sum of digits 2+0+1+9=12, divisible by 3. So 2019 \u00f73",

So, the fractional part is always between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive).\n\nGiven \\( \\langle a^{-1} \\rangle = \\langle a^2 \\rangle \\), this means:\n\\( a^{-1} - \\lfloor a^{-1} \\rfloor = a^2 - \\lfloor a^2 \\rfloor \\).\n\nSince \\( 2 < a^2 < 3 \\), \\( \\lfloor a^2 \\rfloor = 2 \\), so the fractional part of \\( a^2 \\) is \\( a^2 - 2 \\).\n\nSimilarly, \\( a^{-1} = 1/a \\). Let's denote \\( \\lfloor a^{-1} \\rfloor = k \\), where \\( k \\) is an integer. Then the fractional part of \\( 1/a \\) is \\( 1/a - k \\).\n\nSetting these equal:\n\\( 1/a - k = a^2 - 2 \\).\n\nRearranging:\n\\( 1/a = a^2 - 2 + k \\).\n\nBut \\( k \\) is the integer part of \\( 1/a \\). Let's think about the possible values of \\( k \\). Since \\( a \\) is between \\( \\sqrt{2} \\) and \\( \\sqrt{3} \\), approximately between 1.414 and 1.732. Therefore, \\( 1/a \\) is between approximately 0.577 and 0.707. So \\( 1/a \\) is less than 1, which means its integer part \\( k \\) is 0. Therefore, \\( \\lfloor 1/a \\rfloor = 0 \\), so the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\( 1/a = a^2 - 2 \\).\n\nSo now we have:\n\\( 1/a = a^2 - 2 \\).\n\nLet's multiply both sides by \\( a \\) to eliminate the denominator:\n\\( 1 = a^3 - 2a \\).\n\nRearranging:\n\\( a^3 - 2a - 1 = 0 \\).\n\nNow we need to solve this cubic equation. Let's check if there's an integer root. Trying \\( a = 1 \\): \\( 1 - 2 - 1 = -2 \\neq 0 \\). \\( a = 2 \\): \\( 8 - 4 -1 = 3 \\neq 0 \\). \\( a = -1 \\): \\( -1 + 2 -1 = 0 \\). So \\( a = -1 \\) is a root, but since \\( a \\) is positive, we can factor out \\( (a + 1) \\):\n\nUsing polynomial division or synthetic division, divide \\( a^3 - 2a -1 \\) by \\( (a + 1) \\):\n\n\\( a^3 - 2a -1 = (a + 1)(a^2 - a - 1) \\).\n\nSo the equation factors to:\n\\( (a + 1)(a^2 - a - 1) = 0 \\).\n\nSince \\( a > 0 \\), \\( a + 1 \\neq 0 \\), so we have \\( a^2 - a - 1 = 0 \\).\n\nSolving this quadratic equation:\n\\( a = [1 \u00b1 \\sqrt(1 + 4)] / 2 = [1 \u00b1 \\sqrt(5)] / 2 \\).\n\nSince \\( a \\) is positive, we take the positive root:\n\\( a = (1 + \\sqrt{5}) / 2 \\).\n\nLet's check if this \\( a \\) satisfies the original condition \\( 2 < a^2 < 3 \\).\n\nCompute \\( a^2 \\):\n\\( a = (1 + \\sqrt{5})/2 \\), so \\( a^2 = [(1 + \\sqrt{5})/2]^2 = (1 + 2\\sqrt{5} + 5)/4 = (6 + 2\\sqrt{5})/4 = (3 + \\sqrt{5})/2 \u2248 (3 + 2.236)/2 \u2248 2.618 \\), which is between 2 and 3. Perfect.\n\nSo \\( a = (1 + \\sqrt{5})/2 \\), which is the positive root of \\( a^2 - a -1 = 0 \\).\n\nNow, we need to compute \\( a^{12} - 144a^{-1} \\).\n\nBut calculating \\( a^{12} \\) directly would be tedious. Instead, notice that \\( a \\) satisfies \\( a^2 = a + 1 \\). Let's use this recurrence relation to express higher powers of \\( a \\) in terms of lower powers.\n\nStarting with \\( a^2 = a + 1 \\), we can compute:\n\n\\( a^3 = a \\cdot a^2 = a(a + 1) = a^2 + a = (a + 1) + a = 2a + 1 \\).\n\n\\( a^4 = a \\cdot a^3 = a(2a + 1) = 2a^2 + a = 2(a + 1) + a = 2a + 2 + a = 3a + 2 \\).\n\n\\( a^5 = a \\cdot a^4 = a(3a + 2) = 3a^2 + 2a = 3(a + 1) + 2a = 3a + 3 + 2a = 5a + 3 \\).\n\nContinuing this pattern, each power can be expressed as a linear combination of \\( a \\) and 1. Let's find a pattern or perhaps use induction to find a general formula.\n\nAlternatively, notice that \\( a \\) is the golden ratio, which satisfies \\( a^n = F_n a + F_{n-1} \\), where \\( F_n \\) is the nth Fibonacci number. Let's verify this:\n\nFor n=1: \\( a^1 = 1a + 0 \\), F1=1, F0=0.\nn=2: \\( a^2 = 1a +1 \\), F2=1, F1=1.\nn=3: \\( a^3 = 2a +1 \\), F3=2, F2=1.\nn=4: \\( a^4 = 3a +2 \\), F4=3, F3=2.\nn=5: \\( a^5 =5a +3 \\), F5=5, F4=3.\nYes, this pattern holds. So, \\( a^n = F_n a + F_{n-1} \\).\n\nTherefore, \\( a^{12} = F_{12} a + F_{11} \\).\n\nThe Fibonacci sequence is: F1=1, F2=1, F3=2, F4=3, F5=5, F6=8, F7=13, F8=21, F9=34, F10=55, F11=89, F12=144.\n\nSo, \\( a^{12} = 144a + 89 \\).\n\nNow, compute \\( a^{12} - 144a^{-1} \\):\n\nSubstitute \\( a^{12} = 144a + 89 \\):\n\n\\( 144a + 89 - 144a^{-1} \\).\n\nWe need to find \\( 144a - 144a^{-1} + 89 \\).\n\nFactor out 144: \\( 144(a - a^{-1}) + 89 \\).\n\nNow, compute \\( a - a^{-1} \\).\n\nFrom the original equation \\( a^2 = a + 1 \\), divide both sides by \\( a \\):\n\n\\( a = 1 + 1/a \\), so \\( a - 1/a = 1 \\).\n\nTherefore, \\( a - a^{-1} = 1 \\).\n\nSubstitute back:\n\n\\( 144(1) + 89 = 144 + 89 = 233 \\).\n\nHence, \\( a^{12} - 144a^{-1} = 233 \\).\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nWe are given a positive real number \\( a \\) satisfying two conditions: the fractional part of \\( 1/a \\) equals the fractional part of \\( a^2 \\), and \\( 2 < a^2 < 3 \\). Our goal is to show that \\( a^{12} - 144a^{-1} = 233 \\).\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the fractional parts.**  \nThe fractional part \\( \\langle x \\rangle = x - \\lfloor x \\rfloor \\). Since \\( 2 < a^2 < 3 \\), the integer part of \\( a^2 \\) is 2, so \\( \\langle a^2 \\rangle = a^2 - 2 \\). For \\( 1/a \\), since \\( a \\) lies between \\( \\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.414 \\) and \\( \\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.732 \\), \\( 1/a \\) is between approximately 0.577 and 0.707.

Equating the fractional parts:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{a} = a^2 - 2.\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Derive a cubic equation.**  \nMultiply both sides by \\( a \\):\n\\[\n1 = a^3 - 2a \\implies a^3 - 2a - 1 = 0.\n\\]\nFactoring, we find \\( a = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2} \\) (the positive root of \\( a^2 - a - 1 = 0 \\)), which satisfies \\( 2 < a^2 < 3 \\).\n\n**Step 3: Compute \\( a^{12} - 144a^{-1} \\).**  \nUsing the recurrence \\( a^2 = a + 1 \\), higher powers of \\( a \\) follow the Fibonacci pattern:\n\\[\na^n = F_n a + F_{n-1},\n\\]\nwhere \\( F_n \\) is the \\( n \\)-th Fibonacci number.

Hmm, let's start by understanding what this expression looks like. Maybe expanding it would help. Let's see, a times (2 - a) is 2a - a\u00b2. So the inequality becomes 2a - a\u00b2 \u2264 1. Rearranging terms, that would be -a\u00b2 + 2a - 1 \u2264 0. Multiplying both sides by -1 (which reverses the inequality) gives a\u00b2 - 2a + 1 \u2265 0. Wait, a\u00b2 - 2a + 1 is a perfect square, right? That's (a - 1)\u00b2. So the inequality simplifies to (a - 1)\u00b2 \u2265 0. But a square of any real number is always non-negative, so this is always true. Therefore, the original inequality must hold for all real numbers a. Let me check with some examples. If a = 1, then 1*(2-1) = 1, which equals 1. If a = 0, then 0*2 = 0 \u2264 1. If a = 2, then 2*0 = 0 \u2264 1. If a = 3, then 3*(-1) = -3 \u2264 1. If a = -1, then (-1)*(3) = -3 \u2264 1. All these cases work. So it seems like completing the square here shows that the expression is always less than or equal to 1.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo show that \\( a(2 - a) \\leq 1 \\) for any real number \\( a \\), start by expanding the left-hand side:  \n\\[\na(2 - a) = 2a - a^2.\n\\]\nRewriting the inequality \\( 2a - a^2 \\leq 1 \\), we rearrange terms to:  \n\\[\n-a^2 + 2a - 1 \\leq 0.\n\\]\nMultiplying both sides by \\(-1\\) (which reverses the inequality) gives:  \n\\[\na^2 - 2a + 1 \\geq 0.\n\\]\nNotice that \\( a^2 - 2a + 1 \\) is a perfect square:  \n\\[\n(a - 1)^2 \\geq 0.\n\\]\nSince the square of any real number is always non-negative, \\( (a - 1)^2 \\geq 0 \\) holds for all real \\( a \\).

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to show that if a + bm + cn = 0, where m and n are positive real numbers with m\u00b3=2 and n\u00b3=4, and a, b, c are rational numbers, then a, b, c must all be zero. Hmm. \n\nFirst, I remember that m\u00b3=2 implies m is the cube root of 2, which is irrational. Similarly, n\u00b3=4, so n is the cube root of 4, which is also irrational. But how does that help? The equation a + bm + cn = 0 involves these irrational numbers multiplied by rational coefficients. The problem wants us to show that the only way this equation holds is if all coefficients are zero. That sounds like proving linear independence over the rationals.\n\nWait, maybe I can express n in terms of m. Since m\u00b3=2, then m = 2^(1/3). Then n\u00b3=4, which is 2\u00b2. So n = 4^(1/3) = (2\u00b2)^(1/3) = 2^(2/3) = [2^(1/3)]\u00b2 = m\u00b2. Oh, right! So n is m squared. That's a key relation. So n = m\u00b2. Therefore, the equation becomes a + bm + c m\u00b2 = 0. Now, this is a polynomial equation in m with rational coefficients. But m is a root of the equation x\u00b3 - 2 = 0. Since x\u00b3 - 2 is irreducible over the rationals (by Eisenstein's criterion with p=2), the minimal polynomial of m over Q is degree 3. Therefore, any polynomial equation in m with rational coefficients that equals zero must be a multiple of x\u00b3 - 2. But here we have a quadratic equation in m. The only way a quadratic equation can hold for m is if all coefficients are zero. Because if there were a non-trivial quadratic relation, that would imply that m satisfies a lower-degree polynomial than its minimal polynomial (which is degree 3), which is impossible. Therefore, a, b, c must all be zero. \n\nWait, let me check that again. Suppose a + bm + cm\u00b2 = 0. If any of a, b, c are non-zero, then m would satisfy a non-zero quadratic equation with rational coefficients. But the minimal polynomial of m over Q is x\u00b3 - 2, which is degree 3. Therefore, there can be no such quadratic equation, so the only solution is a = b = c = 0. That makes sense. So the conclusion follows from the fact that {1, m, m\u00b2} are linearly independent over Q, since they form a basis for Q(m) over Q, which has degree 3. Hence, any linear combination with rational coefficients equaling zero must have all coefficients zero. Yeah, that seems right. I think that's the main idea here. So the key steps are expressing n in terms of m, reducing the equation to a quadratic in m, and using the minimal polynomial to argue that the coefficients must vanish.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo show that \\( a = b = c = 0 \\), we start by observing the relationships between \\( m \\) and \\( n \\). Given \\( m^3 = 2 \\) and \\( n^3 = 4 \\), we can express \\( n \\) in terms of \\( m \\). Since \\( n^3 = 4 = 2^2 \\), we rewrite \\( n \\) as \\( n = (2^2)^{1/3} = 2^{2/3} \\). Noting that \\( m = 2^{1/3} \\), it follows that \\( n = m^2 \\). Substituting \\( n = m^2 \\) into the equation \\( a + bm + cn = 0 \\), we get:\n\n\\[\na + bm + c m^2 = 0.\n\\]\n\nThis is a polynomial equation in \\( m \\) with rational coefficients \\( a, b, c \\). However, \\( m \\) is a root of the irreducible polynomial \\( x^3 - 2 = 0 \\) over the rationals (by Eisenstein\u2019s criterion with \\( p = 2 \\)), meaning \\( m \\) has minimal polynomial degree 3. If \\( a + bm + cm^2 = 0 \\) held for non-zero \\( a, b, c \\), this would imply \\( m \\) satisfies a non-trivial quadratic equation with rational coefficients. But this contradicts the minimality of the degree-3 polynomial \\( x^3 - 2 \\), as no lower-degree polynomial can annihilate \\( m \\). \n\nTherefore, the only solution is \\( a = b = c = 0 \\), ensuring no non-trivial linear combination of \\( 1, m, m^2 \\) over the rationals can equal zero.

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out what f(1) is for the function f(x) = 5x + 4 and show that it's 9. Let me start by recalling what a function does. A function takes an input, in this case x, and gives an output based on the rule defined by the function. Here, the rule is to multiply the input by 5 and then add 4 to the result.\n\nSo, if I plug in x = 1 into the function, I should follow the steps: first multiply 1 by 5, which gives 5, and then add 4 to that. Let me check that again. 5 times 1 is definitely 5. Adding 4 to 5 gives 9. That seems straightforward. But maybe I should write it out step by step to make sure I haven't missed anything.\n\nWait, maybe I should also consider if there's any ambiguity in the function definition. The function is given as f(x) = 5x + 4. There's no parentheses or other operations that could change the order of operations here. According to standard mathematical conventions, multiplication comes before addition, so 5x means 5 multiplied by x, and then add 4. So substituting x with 1, it's 5*1 + 4. \n\nLet me compute that again: 5*1 is 5, plus 4 is 9. Yep, that's 9. Is there any other way this could be interpreted? If the function were written differently, like 5(x + 4), that would be different, but it's not. It's 5x + 4, so the order is correct. \n\nI guess another way to look at it is to break down the function into parts. The term 5x is linear, and adding 4 shifts the entire line up by 4 units. When x is 1, the slope of 5 means that for each unit increase in x, the output increases by 5. Starting at x=0, f(0) would be 5*0 +4 =4. Then at x=1, it's 5*1 +4=9. That makes sense. \n\nMaybe I should also verify with substitution. Let's substitute x=1 into the function step by step. The original function is f(x) =5x +4. Replace x with 1: f(1)=5*(1) +4. Compute the multiplication first: 5*1=5. Then add 4: 5+4=9. So f(1)=9. \n\nI think that's all there is to it. The problem seems straightforward, but it's important to follow the order of operations correctly. Since there's no ambiguity in the function's definition, substituting x=1 directly gives the result 9.

Each cup has some coffee and some milk, none were zero. Angela drank a quarter of the total milk and a sixth of the total coffee. We need to find how many people are in the family, and show it's 5.\n\nFirst, let's define variables. Let\u2019s say the total milk used is M ounces, and the total coffee is C ounces. Each family member drinks 8 ounces, so the total mixture consumed by the family is 8n ounces, where n is the number of people. Since each person's drink is a mixture of milk and coffee, the total milk plus total coffee should equal the total mixture. So, M + C = 8n.\n\nAngela drank a quarter of the total milk, so she drank M/4 ounces of milk. Similarly, she drank a sixth of the total coffee, which is C/6 ounces. Her total consumption is 8 ounces, so M/4 + C/6 = 8.\n\nNow we have two equations:\n1. M + C = 8n\n2. M/4 + C/6 = 8\n\nLet me solve these equations. Let's multiply the second equation by 12 to eliminate denominators:\n12*(M/4 + C/6) = 12*8 \u2192 3M + 2C = 96.\n\nFrom the first equation, M = 8n - C. Substitute this into the second equation:\n3*(8n - C) + 2C = 96 \u2192 24n - 3C + 2C = 96 \u2192 24n - C = 96 \u2192 C = 24n - 96.\n\nBut since C must be positive (they used some coffee), 24n - 96 > 0 \u2192 24n > 96 \u2192 n > 4. So n must be at least 5.\n\nBut we also need to check if the milk M is positive. Since M = 8n - C, substitute C:\nM = 8n - (24n - 96) = 8n -24n +96 = -16n +96. For M to be positive, -16n +96 >0 \u2192 16n <96 \u2192 n <6.\n\nSo n must be greater than 4 and less than 6. The only integer in that range is 5. Therefore, n=5.\n\nLet me verify with n=5. Then C=24*5 -96=120-96=24. M=8*5 -24=40-24=16. Check Angela's consumption: M/4=4, C/6=4. 4+4=8, which matches. Also, each person's drink is a mix. Since total milk is 16 and coffee is 24, each of the 5 people must have some milk and coffee. For example, if Angela had 4 milk and 4 coffee, the remaining 12 milk and 20 coffee can be split among 4 people, each getting 3 milk and 5 coffee, but since each must have some of both, as long as the remaining amounts are divided such that each cup has positive amounts, it works. So n=5 is valid.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nLet's start by defining the total amounts of milk and coffee consumed by the family.

Since her entire drink was 8 ounces, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{M}{4} + \\frac{C}{6} = 8.\n\\]\n\nMultiply this equation by 12 to eliminate fractions:\n\n\\[\n3M + 2C = 96.\n\\]\n\nNow substitute \\( M = 8n - C \\) (from the first equation) into \\( 3M + 2C = 96 \\):\n\n\\[\n3(8n - C) + 2C = 96 \\implies 24n - C = 96 \\implies C = 24n - 96.\n\\]\n\nFor \\( C \\) to be positive (since coffee was used), \\( 24n - 96 > 0 \\implies n > 4 \\). Similarly, substitute \\( C = 24n - 96 \\) back into \\( M = 8n - C \\):\n\n\\[\nM = 8n - (24n - 96) = -16n + 96.\n\\]\n\nFor \\( M \\) to be positive, \\( -16n + 96 > 0 \\implies n < 6 \\). Combining these inequalities, \\( 4 < n < 6 \\). Since \\( n \\) must be an integer, the only solution is \\( n = 5 \\).\n\n**Verification:**  \nIf \\( n = 5 \\):\n- Total mixture: \\( 8 \\times 5 = 40 \\) ounces.\n- Total coffee: \\( C = 24 \\times 5 - 96 = 24 \\) ounces.\n- Total milk: \\( M = 40 - 24 = 16 \\) ounces.\n- Angela\u2019s drink: \\( \\frac{16}{4} + \\frac{24}{6} = 4 + 4 = 8 \\) ounces (matches her consumption).\n\nThe remaining \\( 16 - 4 = 12 \\) ounces of milk and \\( 24 - 4 = 20 \\) ounces of coffee can be distributed among the other 4 family members, ensuring each cup has positive amounts (e.g., \\( 3 \\) milk and \\( 5 \\) coffee per person). Thus, the family has **5 people**.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  HDiv \u2115+ \u2115+ \u2115+\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nlinarith failed

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, we have a function f that's invertible, and we're told that f(2) = f\u207b\u00b9(2) = 4. We need to find the value of f(f(2)) and show that it's 2. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the given information. Since f is invertible, that means it's bijective\u2014both injective and surjective. So, every element in the codomain is mapped to by exactly one element in the domain. The inverse function f\u207b\u00b9 exists and undoes what f does.\n\nNow, the key points given are f(2) = 4 and f\u207b\u00b9(2) = 4. Let's recall what these mean. The first equation, f(2) = 4, is straightforward: when you input 2 into f, you get 4. The second equation, f\u207b\u00b9(2) = 4, means that when you input 2 into the inverse function f\u207b\u00b9, you get 4. But by the definition of an inverse function, f\u207b\u00b9(2) = 4 implies that f(4) = 2. Because if f\u207b\u00b9(y) = x, then f(x) = y. So, applying that here, since f\u207b\u00b9(2) = 4, it must be that f(4) = 2.\n\nWait, that's a crucial connection. So f(4) is 2. Now, the problem asks for f(f(2)). Let's compute that step by step. We know f(2) is 4, so f(f(2)) is f(4). But we just established that f(4) = 2. Therefore, f(f(2)) = f(4) = 2. That seems straightforward, but let me make sure there's no trick here.\n\nLet me double-check. If f is invertible, then f and f\u207b\u00b9 are inverses. So, applying f and then f\u207b\u00b9 (or vice versa) should get you back to your original input. For example, f\u207b\u00b9(f(x)) = x and f(f\u207b\u00b9(y)) = y. But in this problem, we're dealing with f(f(2)). Since f(2) is 4, then f(4) must be 2 because f\u207b\u00b9(2) = 4. Wait, that's exactly the same as saying f(4) = 2. So yes, putting it all together, f(f(2)) = f(4) = 2.\n\nIs there another way to see this? Let's think about the inverse function. Since f\u207b\u00b9(2) = 4, that means that f(4) = 2 by definition. So when you apply f to 4, you get 2. Therefore, substituting back, f(f(2)) = f(4) = 2. That's the same conclusion.\n\nI should also consider if there's any possibility that the invertibility condition affects this. But since f is invertible, there's a unique inverse, so there's no ambiguity here. The function f is one-to-one and onto, so each input has a unique output and vice versa. Therefore, the relationships f(2)=4 and f\u207b\u00b9(2)=4 are consistent and don't lead to any contradictions.\n\nAnother angle: Let's use the property of inverse functions. If f is invertible, then f\u207b\u00b9(f(x)) = x for all x in the domain of f, and f(f\u207b\u00b9(y)) = y for all y in the codomain. But here, we're dealing with f(f(2)). Let's let x = 2. Then f(2) = 4. So f(f(2)) = f(4). But since f\u207b\u00b9(2) = 4, applying f to 4 must give 2. Therefore, f(4) = 2. Hence, f(f(2)) = 2.\n\nI think that covers all bases. The key steps are recognizing that f\u207b\u00b9(2) = 4 implies f(4) = 2, and then substituting into the expression f(f(2)) which becomes f(4) and thus 2. The invertibility ensures that these relationships hold without any ambiguity.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nLet's start by unpacking the given information. We know that \\( f \\) is an invertible function, meaning it has a well-defined inverse \\( f^{-1} \\). Specifically, we are told two key facts:  \n1. \\( f(2) = 4 \\) (inputting 2 into \\( f \\) gives 4).  \n2. \\( f^{-1}(2) = 4 \\) (inputting 2 into the inverse function \\( f^{-1} \\) gives 4).  \n\nBy the definition of an inverse function, \\( f^{-1}(y) = x \\) implies \\( f(x) = y \\). Applying this to the second fact, \\( f^{-1}(2) = 4 \\) directly tells us that \\( f(4) = 2 \\).  \n\nNow, we need to compute \\( f(f(2)) \\). Let's break this down:  \n- First, \\( f(2) = 4 \\) (from the first given fact).  \n- Substituting this result into the outer function, we get \\( f(f(2)) = f(4) \\).  \n- But we already established \\( f(4) = 2 \\) (from the inverse relationship).  \n\nThus, \\( f(f(2)) = 2 \\).  \n\n**Why does this work?**  \nThe invertibility of \\( f \\) guarantees that the relationships between inputs and outputs are unique and reversible. Since \\( f^{-1}(2) = 4 \\), there is no ambiguity in stating \\( f(4) = 2 \\). This one-to-one correspondence ensures that substituting \\( f(2) = 4 \\) into \\( f \\) again reliably produces 2. The structure of inverse functions enforces this consistency, making the conclusion unavoidable.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem: find the largest negative integer x that satisfies 24x \u2261 15 mod 1199, and show it's -449. Hmm, so first, I need to solve the congruence equation 24x \u2261 15 (mod 1199). Then, among all the solutions, find the largest negative one. The answer is supposed to be -449, so I need to verify that.\n\nFirst, solving a linear congruence like 24x \u2261 15 mod 1199. To solve this, I remember that the equation ax \u2261 b mod m has solutions if and only if gcd(a, m) divides b. So let's check gcd(24, 1199). Let's compute that. Let's divide 1199 by 24. 24*49 = 1176, 1199 - 1176 = 23. Then gcd(24,23) is 1, since 24 and 23 are consecutive integers. So gcd(24,1199)=1. Since 1 divides 15, there is a unique solution modulo 1199.\n\nSo the next step is to find the multiplicative inverse of 24 modulo 1199. Because if we can find an inverse of 24 mod 1199, then we can multiply both sides by that inverse to get x \u2261 15 * inverse(24) mod 1199. Then, once we have x \u2261 k mod 1199, the solutions are all integers of the form x = k + 1199t for integers t. Then, the largest negative integer would be the one where t is chosen such that x is negative but as close to zero as possible.\n\nSo first, find inverse of 24 mod 1199. To find the inverse, we can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. Let's apply that.\n\nWe need to find integers s and t such that 24s + 1199t = 1. The coefficient s will be the inverse of 24 modulo 1199.\n\nLet's perform the Euclidean algorithm steps:\n\n1199 divided by 24: 24*49 = 1176, remainder 1199 - 1176 = 23.\n\nSo 1199 = 24*49 + 23.\n\nNow, 24 divided by 23: 23*1 = 23, remainder 1.\n\n24 = 23*1 + 1.\n\nThen, 23 divided by 1: 1*23 = 23, remainder 0. So gcd is 1.\n\nNow, backtracking to express 1 as a combination:\n\nFrom the second step: 1 = 24 - 23*1.\n\nBut 23 = 1199 - 24*49 from the first step.\n\nSubstitute that into the equation:\n\n1 = 24 - (1199 - 24*49)*1\n\n= 24 - 1199*1 + 24*49\n\n= 24*(1 + 49) - 1199*1\n\n= 24*50 - 1199*1.\n\nSo, 1 = 24*50 - 1199*1. Therefore, 24*50 \u2261 1 mod 1199. So the inverse of 24 mod 1199 is 50.\n\nTherefore, multiplying both sides of 24x \u2261 15 mod 1199 by 50 gives:\n\nx \u2261 15*50 mod 1199.\n\nCompute 15*50 = 750. So x \u2261 750 mod 1199.\n\nThus, the general solution is x = 750 + 1199t for integers t.\n\nNow, we need to find the largest negative integer x. So x must be less than 0, but as close to 0 as possible. So we need to find the largest t such that 750 + 1199t < 0.\n\nSolve for t:\n\n750 + 1199t < 0\n\n1199t < -750\n\nt < -750 / 1199\n\nCompute -750 divided by 1199. Since 1199 is approximately 1200, 750/1200 is 0.625. So approximately t < -0.625. So the largest integer t satisfying this is t = -1.\n\nPlugging t = -1 into x = 750 + 1199*(-1) = 750 - 1199 = -449.\n\nCheck if that's the largest negative. If t = -1, x = -449. If t = 0, x = 750, which is positive. So yes, t = -1 gives the largest negative solution.\n\nWait, but let me verify if there's a t = -1 gives x = -449. Let's compute 750 - 1199. 1199 - 750 = 449, so 750 - 1199 = -449. Correct.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a mistake here. Let me check again. Suppose t = -1: x = 750 - 1199 = -449. If t = -2: x = 750 - 2*1199 = 750 - 2398 = -1648. Which is more negative. So indeed, t = -1 gives the largest negative solution, which is -449.\n\nBut let me check if -449 is indeed a solution. Let's plug x = -449 into 24x mod 1199.\n\nCompute 24*(-449) = -10776. Now, compute -10776 mod 1199. To find this, we can add multiples of 1199 until we get a positive result.\n\nFirst, divide 10776 by 1199. Let's see: 1199*8 = 9592. 10776 - 9592 = 1184. So 10776 = 1199*8 + 1184. Therefore, -10776 \u2261 -1184 mod 1199. But -1184 + 1199 = 15. So -10776 \u2261 15 mod 1199. Therefore, 24*(-449) \u2261 15 mod 1199. Correct. So -449 is indeed a solution.\n\nTherefore, the largest negative integer x satisfying the congruence is -449.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there's a larger negative solution. Wait, the solutions are x \u2261 750 mod 1199. So the next solution after -449 would be -449 + 1199 = 750, which is positive. So there's no integer between -449 and 0 that is a solution. Therefore, -449 is indeed the largest negative solution.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Find that gcd(24,1199)=1, so inverse exists.\n\n2. Find inverse of 24 mod 1199 using Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which is 50.\n\n3. Multiply both sides by 50 to get x \u2261 750 mod 1199.\n\n4. Express solutions as x = 750 + 1199t.\n\n5. Find t such that x is largest negative: solve 750 + 1199t < 0 => t < -750/1199 \u2248 -0.625, so t = -1.\n\n6. Compute x = 750 - 1199 = -449.\n\n7. Verify that x = -449 satisfies the original congruence.\n\nAll steps check out, so the answer is -449.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo find the largest negative integer \\( x \\) satisfying \\( 24x \\equiv 15 \\pmod{1199} \\), we start by solving the congruence. Since \\( \\gcd(24, 1199) = 1 \\), there is a unique solution modulo \\( 1199 \\). We need the multiplicative inverse of \\( 24 \\) modulo \\( 1199 \\), which we find using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm:\n\n1. **Step 1:** Apply the Euclidean Algorithm to \\( 24 \\) and \\( 1199 \\):\n   - \\( 1199 = 24 \\times 49 + 23 \\),\n   - \\( 24 = 23 \\times 1 + 1 \\),\n   - \\( 23 = 1 \\times 23 + 0 \\).\n   This confirms \\( \\gcd(24, 1199) = 1 \\).\n\n2. **Step 2:** Back-substitute to express \\( 1 \\) as a combination of \\( 24 \\) and \\( 1199 \\):\n   - From \\( 1 = 24 - 23 \\times 1 \\),\n   - Substitute \\( 23 = 1199 - 24 \\times 49 \\):\n     \\[\n     1 = 24 - (1199 - 24 \\times 49) = 24 \\times 50 - 1199 \\times 1.\n     \\]\n   Thus, \\( 24 \\times 50 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{1199} \\), so the inverse of \\( 24 \\) modulo \\( 1199 \\) is \\( 50 \\).\n\n3. **Step 3:** Multiply both sides of \\( 24x \\equiv 15 \\pmod{1199} \\) by \\( 50 \\):\n   \\[\n   x \\equiv 15 \\times 50 \\pmod{1199} \\implies x \\equiv 750 \\pmod{1199}.\n   \\]\n   The general solution is \\( x = 750 + 1199t \\) for integers \\( t \\).\n\n4. **Step 4:** Find the largest negative \\( x \\). Solve \\( 750 + 1199t < 0 \\):\n   \\[\n   1199t < -750 \\implies t < -\\frac{750}{1199} \\approx -0.625.\n   \\]\n   The largest integer \\( t \\) satisfying this is \\( t = -1 \\). Substituting \\( t = -1 \\):\n   \\[\n   x = 750 - 1199 = -449.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Verification:** Check \\( 24 \\times (-449) \\equiv 15 \\pmod{1199} \\):\n   - Compute \\( 24 \\times (-449) = -10776 \\).\n   - Reduce modulo \\( 1199 \\): \\( -10776 \\equiv 15 \\pmod{1199} \\) (since \\( 10776 = 1199 \\times 8 + 1184 \\), and \\( -1184 + 1199 = 15 \\)).\n\nThus, \\( x = -449 \\) is the largest negative integer satisfying the congruence.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to prove that the fraction (21n + 4)/(14n + 3) is irreducible for every natural number n. Hmm, irreducible means that the numerator and the denominator have no common divisors other than 1, right? So their greatest common divisor (GCD) should be 1.\n\nLet me recall how to find the GCD of two numbers. The Euclidean algorithm comes to mind. Maybe I can apply that here. The Euclidean algorithm works by repeatedly applying the division algorithm to reduce the problem of finding the GCD of two numbers to smaller pairs of numbers until we reach a remainder of zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\nSo, let's try applying the Euclidean algorithm to the numerator and denominator. Let's denote a = 21n + 4 and b = 14n + 3. Then, we need to find GCD(a, b).\n\nFirst step of the Euclidean algorithm: divide the larger number by the smaller one. Let's see, 21n + 4 divided by 14n + 3. Let's perform the division.\n\n21n + 4 divided by 14n + 3. Let's think of this as (21n + 4) = q*(14n + 3) + r, where q is the quotient and r is the remainder.\n\nLet me compute q. The coefficient of n in the numerator is 21, and in the denominator, it's 14. So 21 divided by 14 is 1.5, but since we're dealing with integers, the quotient q would be 1. Let's check:\n\n1*(14n + 3) = 14n + 3. Subtract this from 21n + 4: (21n +4) - (14n +3) = 7n +1. So the remainder is 7n +1.\n\nSo now, GCD(21n +4, 14n +3) = GCD(14n +3, 7n +1).\n\nNext step: apply the Euclidean algorithm to 14n +3 and 7n +1.\n\nAgain, divide 14n +3 by 7n +1. The coefficient here is 14n divided by 7n, which is 2. So q=2.\n\n2*(7n +1) = 14n +2. Subtract this from 14n +3: (14n +3) - (14n +2) =1. So the remainder is 1.\n\nNow, GCD(14n +3, 7n +1) = GCD(7n +1, 1).\n\nThe GCD of any number and 1 is 1, because 1 divides every integer, and the only positive divisor of 1 is itself. Therefore, the GCD is 1.\n\nSince the GCD of the numerator and denominator is 1, the fraction (21n +4)/(14n +3) is irreducible for all natural numbers n.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Suppose there's a common divisor d >1 of 21n +4 and 14n +3. Then d divides their difference, which is (21n +4) - (14n +3) =7n +1. So d divides 7n +1. But then d also divides 14n +3 and 7n +1. Then d divides 14n +3 - 2*(7n +1) =14n +3 -14n -2=1. So d divides 1, which implies d=1. Therefore, the GCD is 1. That confirms it again.\n\nSo both methods\u2014using the Euclidean algorithm and using the property that any common divisor must divide the difference\u2014lead to the conclusion that the GCD is 1. Therefore, the fraction is irreducible.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo prove that the fraction \\(\\frac{21n + 4}{14n + 3}\\) is irreducible for every natural number \\(n\\), we need to show that the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator \\(21n + 4\\) and the denominator \\(14n + 3\\) is always \\(1\\). \n\n**Step 1: Apply the Euclidean Algorithm**  \nThe Euclidean Algorithm states that \\(\\gcd(a, b) = \\gcd(b, a \\mod b)\\). Let \\(a = 21n + 4\\) and \\(b = 14n + 3\\).  \n- Divide \\(a\\) by \\(b\\):  \n  \\(21n + 4 = 1 \\cdot (14n + 3) + (7n + 1)\\).  \n  The remainder is \\(7n + 1\\).  \n  Now, \\(\\gcd(21n + 4, 14n + 3) = \\gcd(14n + 3, 7n + 1)\\).\n\n**Step 2: Repeat the Process**  \nNext, apply the algorithm to \\(14n + 3\\) and \\(7n + 1\\):  \n- Divide \\(14n + 3\\) by \\(7n + 1\\):  \n  \\(14n + 3 = 2 \\cdot (7n + 1) + 1\\).  \n  The remainder is \\(1\\).  \n  Now, \\(\\gcd(14n + 3, 7n + 1) = \\gcd(7n + 1, 1)\\).\n\n**Step 3: Final GCD**  \nThe GCD of any number and \\(1\\) is \\(1\\), since \\(1\\) divides every integer and has no divisors other than itself. Thus:  \n\\[\n\\gcd(7n + 1, 1) = 1.\n\\]\n\n**Conclusion**  \nSince the GCD of \\(21n + 4\\) and \\(14n + 3\\) is \\(1\\) for all natural numbers \\(n\\), the fraction \\(\\frac{21n + 4}{14n + 3}\\) cannot be simplified further.

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the units digit of 2^2010 and show that it's 4. Let me start by recalling that the units digit of powers of 2 cycles in a pattern.

So the cycle length here is 4. That means the units digit of 2^n depends on n modulo 4. If I can find 2010 modulo 4, that should tell me where in the cycle 2^2010 falls.\n\nLet me calculate 2010 divided by 4. 4 times 502 is 2008, so 2010 - 2008 = 2. Therefore, 2010 \u2261 2 mod 4. That means the units digit of 2^2010 should be the same as the units digit of 2^2, which is 4. \n\nWait, let me double-check. If the cycle is 4, then exponents that are 1 mod 4 have units digit 2, 2 mod 4 have 4, 3 mod 4 have 8, and 0 mod 4 (like 4, 8, 12, etc.) have 6. Since 2010 divided by 4 leaves a remainder of 2, it's in the second position of the cycle, which is 4. That makes sense. So the units digit should indeed be 4. \n\nI think that's the main idea. Maybe I should also mention why the cycle is 4. It's because the units digit cycles every time the exponent increases by 4. This is related to Euler's theorem, where \u03c6(10) = 4, so 2^4 \u2261 1 mod 10, but since 2 and 10 are not coprime, maybe that's not directly applicable. But the pattern still holds empirically. So relying on the observed pattern is sufficient here.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo determine the units digit of \\(2^{2010}\\), observe that the units digits of powers of 2 repeat in a predictable cycle.

To find the position of \\(2^{2010}\\) in this cycle, compute \\(2010 \\mod 4\\). \n\nSince \\(2010 \\div 4 = 502\\) with a remainder of \\(2\\), we have \\(2010 \\equiv 2 \\mod 4\\).

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to show that the sum of cubes from 0 to n-1 is equal to the square of the sum of numbers from 0 to n-1. Let me start by recalling some formulas. The sum of the first m natural numbers is m(m+1)/2. But here, the sum is from k=0 to n-1, so that's like summing up to (n-1). Wait, the standard formula is for sum from 1 to m, which is m(m+1)/2. If we start at 0, then it's the same as sum from 1 to n-1 plus 0, so the sum would be (n-1)n/2. So the right-hand side of the equation is [(n-1)n/2]^2.\n\nNow the left-hand side is the sum of cubes from 0 to n-1. Again, 0 cubed is 0, so that's the same as the sum from k=1 to n-1 of k^3. The problem is to show that this sum equals the square of the sum of the numbers.\n\nLooking at the context provided, there's a proof using Nicomachus's Theorem. Let me see. The theorem states that each cube n^3 can be expressed as the sum of consecutive odd numbers starting from n\u00b2 - n + 1 up to n\u00b2 + n - 1. Also, the first term for (n+1)^3 is two greater than the last term for n^3. So when you add up all these cubes, you're essentially adding up a sequence of consecutive odd numbers.\n\nIn the context's proof, they show that the sum of cubes up to n is equal to the sum of the first (n\u00b2 + n)/2 odd numbers. Then, by the Odd Number Theorem, which states that the sum of the first m odd numbers is m\u00b2, this sum becomes [(n\u00b2 + n)/2]^2. But wait, in the problem here, the sum is up to n-1. Let me adjust that.\n\nIf the original problem is sum from k=0 to n-1 of k^3, that's equivalent to sum from k=1 to n-1 of k^3. According to Nicomachus's approach, each k^3 is a sequence of odd numbers. When we sum all these k^3 terms from k=1 to n-1, we're combining all their corresponding odd numbers. Since each cube's sequence ends at k\u00b2 + k - 1, the last term for k = n-1 would be (n-1)^2 + (n-1) - 1 = n\u00b2 - 2n + 1 + n -1 -1 = n\u00b2 - n -1. Wait, maybe I should check that again.\n\nWait, for a general k, the last term in the sequence for k^3 is k\u00b2 + k -1. So for k = n-1, the last term would be (n-1)^2 + (n-1) -1. Let's compute that: (n\u00b2 - 2n +1) + n -1 -1 = n\u00b2 -2n +1 +n -2 = n\u00b2 -n -1. Hmm, but the total sequence of odds up to that point would be the sum of all odds up to n\u00b2 -n -1. But according to the context's proof, when summing up to n^3, the last term is n\u00b2 +n -1. Wait, maybe there's a shift here because the problem here is sum up to (n-1)^3, so the last term would be (n-1)^2 + (n-1) -1 = n\u00b2 -n -1. Then, the sum of all these odds would be the sum from 1 up to n\u00b2 -n -1 of the odd numbers. But wait, the context's proof says that the sum of cubes up to n is the sum of the first (n\u00b2 +n)/2 odds. So if we adjust for sum up to n-1, then the number of odds would be [( (n-1)^2 + (n-1) ) /2] = [ (n\u00b2 -2n +1 +n -1 ) /2 ] = (n\u00b2 -n)/2. So the sum of the first (n\u00b2 -n)/2 odds would be [(n\u00b2 -n)/2]^2. But the sum of cubes up to n-1 is equal to that. Wait, but the right-hand side of the original problem is [sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k]^2, which is [(n-1)n/2]^2. Which is exactly [(n\u00b2 -n)/2]^2. So that matches. Therefore, the sum of cubes up to n-1 is equal to the square of the sum of the numbers up to n-1. Therefore, the proof follows from Nicomachus's approach by recognizing that summing the cubes corresponds to summing consecutive odd numbers up to a certain point, and the total of those odds is the square of the triangular number. So putting it all together, the key steps are:\n\n1. Each cube k^3 is a sum of consecutive odd numbers starting from k\u00b2 -k +1 to k\u00b2 +k -1.\n2. When summing all cubes from 1 to m (where m = n-1), the total is the sum of all these consecutive odds.\n3. The first term of the next cube (m+1)^3 is two more than the last term of m^3, so the entire sequence is a continuous set of odds without gaps.\n4. Therefore, the total sum of cubes up to m is the sum of the first T odds, where T is the total number of odds used, which is (m\u00b2 +m)/2.\n5. By the Odd Number Theorem, the sum of the first T odds is T\u00b2, which equals [(m\u00b2 +m)/2]^2. But since m = n-1, this becomes [(n-1)n/2]^2, which is exactly the square of the sum of the first (n-1) natural numbers.\n\nHence, the equality holds.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo show that the sum of cubes from \\(0\\) to \\(n-1\\) equals the square of the sum of the numbers from \\(0\\) to \\(n-1\\), we use Nicomachus's insight that every cube \\(k^3\\) can be decomposed into a sequence of consecutive odd numbers. Specifically, \\(k^3\\) equals the sum of the odd numbers starting at \\(k^2 - k + 1\\) and ending at \\(k^2 + k - 1\\). For example, \\(2^3 = 3 + 5\\) and \\(3^3 = 7 + 9 + 11\\).\n\nWhen we sum all cubes from \\(1^3\\) to \\((n-1)^3\\), we are effectively concatenating these sequences of odd numbers. Critically, the last term of \\(k^3\\)\u2019s sequence (\\(k^2 + k - 1\\)) is followed by the first term of \\((k+1)^3\\)\u2019s sequence (\\((k+1)^2 - (k+1) + 1\\)), which is exactly \\(2\\) greater. This ensures no gaps in the overall sequence of odds. \n\nFor the sum up to \\((n-1)^3\\), the final odd number in the combined sequence is \\((n-1)^2 + (n-1) - 1 = n^2 - n - 1\\). The total number of odd terms summed is the same as the number of terms needed to reach this point. By the Odd Number Theorem, the sum of the first \\(m\\) odd numbers is \\(m^2\\). Here, \\(m\\) corresponds to the triangular number \\(\\frac{(n-1)n}{2}\\), which counts how many odd numbers are included in the sequence up to \\(n^2 - n - 1\\). \n\nThus, the sum of cubes becomes \\(\\left(\\frac{(n-1)n}{2}\\right)^2\\), which is precisely the square of the sum of the numbers from \\(0\\) to \\(n-1\\).

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. We need to show that for positive integers m \u2264 n, f(2^m) divides f(2^n), where f(x) = 4^x + 6^x + 9^x. Hmm, first, let's understand the function f(x). It's a sum of three terms: 4^x, 6^x, and 9^x. Let me write that out: f(x) = 4^x + 6^x + 9^x. \n\nWait, 4, 6, and 9 are all powers of smaller numbers. 4 is 2\u00b2, 6 is 2\u00d73, and 9 is 3\u00b2. Maybe rewriting them in terms of 2 and 3 could help. Let's see: 4^x = (2\u00b2)^x = 2^{2x}, 6^x = (2\u00d73)^x = 2^x 3^x, and 9^x = (3\u00b2)^x = 3^{2x}. So f(x) = 2^{2x} + 2^x 3^x + 3^{2x}. \n\nHmm, that looks like a quadratic in terms of 2^x and 3^x. Let me check: If I let a = 2^x and b = 3^x, then f(x) = a\u00b2 + ab + b\u00b2. Oh, right! Because a\u00b2 + ab + b\u00b2 is a known expression. Wait, a\u00b2 + ab + b\u00b2 factors as (a + b)^2 - ab, but maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, notice that a\u00b3 - b\u00b3 = (a - b)(a\u00b2 + ab + b\u00b2). So a\u00b2 + ab + b\u00b2 is a factor of a\u00b3 - b\u00b3. That might be useful here.\n\nSo, if f(x) = a\u00b2 + ab + b\u00b2 where a = 2^x and b = 3^x, then maybe we can relate f(x) to a\u00b3 - b\u00b3. Let's compute a\u00b3 - b\u00b3: (2^x)^3 - (3^x)^3 = 8^x - 27^x. But how does that connect to f(x)? Since a\u00b3 - b\u00b3 = (a - b)(a\u00b2 + ab + b\u00b2), then a\u00b2 + ab + b\u00b2 = (a\u00b3 - b\u00b3)/(a - b). So f(x) = (8^x - 27^x)/(2^x - 3^x). Wait, but 2^x - 3^x is negative if x is positive, but maybe the sign doesn't matter for divisibility. Let me check with x=1: f(1) = 4 + 6 + 9 = 19. Then (8 - 27)/(2 - 3) = (-19)/(-1) = 19. Yes, that works. So f(x) = (8^x - 27^x)/(2^x - 3^x). \n\nSo, f(x) can be expressed as (8^x - 27^x)/(2^x - 3^x). That's interesting. Now, the problem is about f(2^m) dividing f(2^n) when m \u2264 n. Let's substitute x with 2^m and 2^n. Let's denote k = 2^m and l = 2^n, where m \u2264 n, so k divides l because 2^m divides 2^n when m \u2264 n. So, we need to show that f(k) divides f(l). \n\nGiven that f(x) = (8^x - 27^x)/(2^x - 3^x), maybe we can find a recursive or multiplicative structure here. Let's think about exponents. Let's write 8 as 2\u00b3 and 27 as 3\u00b3. So 8^x = (2\u00b3)^x = 2^{3x}, and 27^x = (3\u00b3)^x = 3^{3x}. So f(x) = (2^{3x} - 3^{3x})/(2^x - 3^x). \n\nBut the denominator is 2^x - 3^x, and the numerator is 2^{3x} - 3^{3x}. Notice that 2^{3x} - 3^{3x} factors as (2^x - 3^x)(2^{2x} + 2^x 3^x + 3^{2x}), which is exactly the denominator times the numerator. Wait, but that's exactly how we got f(x). So f(x) = 2^{2x} + 2^x 3^x + 3^{2x} = (2^{3x} - 3^{3x})/(2^x - 3^x). \n\nSo, perhaps there's a way to express f(2^n) in terms of f(2^m) when m \u2264 n. Let's consider that 2^n is a multiple of 2^m since m \u2264 n. Let's let n = m + t for some non-negative integer t. Then 2^n = 2^{m + t} = 2^m * 2^t. So maybe we can write f(2^{m + t}) in terms of f(2^m). \n\nAlternatively, think of f(2^n) as a geometric-like sequence. Let's see: Let's denote x = 2^m, then 2^n = 2^{m + k} = x * 2^k. Wait, maybe not. Let's try specific examples to see a pattern. Let's take m=1, n=2. Then f(2^1)=f(2)=4\u00b2 +6\u00b2 +9\u00b2=16+36+81=133. f(2^2)=f(4)=4^4 +6^4 +9^4=256 + 1296 + 6561= 8113. Now check if 133 divides 8113. Let's divide 8113 by 133: 133*60=7980, 8113-7980=133. So 133*61=8113. Yes, so 133 divides 8113. So f(2) divides f(4). Similarly, check m=1, n=3: f(8)=4^8 +6^8 +9^8. That's a big number, but perhaps 133 divides it. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. \n\nAlternatively, using the expression f(x) = (8^x - 27^x)/(2^x - 3^x). Then f(2^n) = (8^{2^n} - 27^{2^n})/(2^{2^n} - 3^{2^n}). Hmm, maybe we can factor this as a multiple of f(2^m). Let's think recursively. Suppose we can write f(2^{k+1}) as f(2^k) multiplied by something. Let's see. Let's let x = 2^k. Then f(2^{k+1}) = f(2*2^k) = 4^{2*2^k} +6^{2*2^k} +9^{2*2^k} = (4^{2^k})^2 + (6^{2^k})^2 + (9^{2^k})^2. Wait, but that's not immediately helpful. \n\nAlternatively, using the expression f(x) = (8^x - 27^x)/(2^x - 3^x). Then f(2^{k+1}) = (8^{2^{k+1}} -27^{2^{k+1}})/(2^{2^{k+1}} -3^{2^{k+1}}). Let's note that 8^{2^{k+1}} = (8^{2^k})^2 and similarly for 27. So the numerator becomes (8^{2^k})^2 - (27^{2^k})^2 = (8^{2^k} -27^{2^k})(8^{2^k} +27^{2^k}). Similarly, the denominator is (2^{2^{k+1}} -3^{2^{k+1}}) = (2^{2^k})^2 - (3^{2^k})^2 = (2^{2^k} -3^{2^k})(2^{2^k} +3^{2^k}). \n\nSo f(2^{k+1}) = [ (8^{2^k} -27^{2^k})(8^{2^k} +27^{2^k}) ] / [ (2^{2^k} -3^{2^k})(2^{2^k} +3^{2^k}) ) ] \n\nBut notice that 8^{2^k} = (2^3)^{2^k} = 2^{3*2^k}, and 27^{2^k} = (3^3)^{2^k} =3^{3*2^k}. Similarly, 2^{2^k} and 3^{2^k} are parts of the denominator. \n\nBut f(2^k) = (8^{2^k} -27^{2^k})/(2^{2^k} -3^{2^k}). So f(2^{k+1}) = [f(2^k) * (8^{2^k} +27^{2^k}) ] / [ (2^{2^k} +3^{2^k}) ) ]\n\nSimplify the expression: f(2^{k+1}) = f(2^k) * [ (8^{2^k} +27^{2^k}) / (2^{2^k} +3^{2^k}) ) ]\n\nLet me compute the term in brackets. Let's denote a = 2^{2^k} and b =3^{2^k}. Then 8^{2^k} = a^3 and 27^{2^k} = b^3. So the term becomes (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3)/(a + b). But a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 factors as (a + b)(a\u00b2 - ab + b\u00b2). So (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3)/(a + b) = a\u00b2 - ab + b\u00b2. \n\nTherefore, f(2^{k+1}) = f(2^k) * (a\u00b2 - ab + b\u00b2) where a =2^{2^k}, b=3^{2^k}. But a\u00b2 -ab +b\u00b2 is another expression. Let's see: a\u00b2 -ab +b\u00b2 = (2^{2^k})\u00b2 -2^{2^k}3^{2^k} + (3^{2^k})\u00b2. That's 4^{2^k} -6^{2^k} +9^{2^k}. Wait, but f(2^k) =4^{2^k} +6^{2^k} +9^{2^k}. So this term is f(2^k) - 2*6^{2^k}. Hmm, not sure if that helps. \n\nWait, but the key point is that f(2^{k+1}) = f(2^k) * (a\u00b2 -ab +b\u00b2). Therefore, f(2^{k+1}) is a multiple of f(2^k). Therefore, if we can show that each step from k to k+1 multiplies by an integer, then by induction, f(2^m) divides f(2^n) when m \u2264 n. \n\nSo, for example, starting with m, then f(2^{m}) divides f(2^{m+1}), which divides f(2^{m+2}), etc., up to f(2^n). Therefore, by transitivity of divisibility, f(2^m) divides f(2^n). \n\nBut wait, we need to confirm that (a\u00b2 -ab +b\u00b2) is an integer. Since a and b are integers, this term is clearly an integer. Therefore, f(2^{k+1}) is f(2^k) multiplied by an integer, hence f(2^k) divides f(2^{k+1}). \n\nTherefore, by induction, for any m \u2264 n, f(2^m) divides f(2^n). Because each time we increment the exponent by 1, the new f value is a multiple of the previous one. So if m \u2264 n, then there's a chain of divisibility from m up to n. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a more direct way. Let's consider that f(2^n) can be written as a product involving f(2^m) when m < n. For example, using the factorization we found earlier, f(2^n) = f(2^{n-1}) * (something). Repeating this, we get f(2^n) as a product of f(2^{n-1}) times another term, and so on down to f(2^m). Therefore, f(2^m) would be a factor in this product. \n\nAnother angle: Since f(x) = a\u00b2 +ab +b\u00b2 where a=2^x and b=3^x, perhaps there's a recurrence relation here. For example, when we go from x to 2x, maybe f(2x) relates to f(x) squared or something similar. Let's compute f(2x): \n\nf(2x) =4^{2x} +6^{2x} +9^{2x} = (4^x)^2 + (6^x)^2 + (9^x)^2. \n\nCompare this to (f(x))^2 = (4^x +6^x +9^x)^2 = 4^{2x} +6^{2x} +9^{2x} + 2*4^x6^x + 2*4^x9^x + 2*6^x9^x. \n\nSo f(2x) = (f(x))^2 - 2*(4^x6^x +4^x9^x +6^x9^x). Hmm, not sure if that helps. \n\nAlternatively, notice that 4, 6, 9 are in geometric progression? 4, 6, 9: 6/4 = 3/2, 9/6 = 3/2. So each term is multiplied by 3/2. So 4, 6, 9 are 4, 4*(3/2), 4*(3/2)^2. So maybe f(x) =4^x (1 + (3/2)^x + (3/2)^{2x}) ). Let's factor out 4^x: f(x) =4^x [1 + (3/2)^x + (3/2)^{2x} ] =4^x [1 + (3/2)^x + (9/4)^x]. \n\nAlternatively, let\u2019s factor out 3^{2x}: f(x) =9^x [ (4/9)^x + (6/9)^x +1 ] =9^x [ ( (2/3)^{2x} + (2/3)^x +1 ) ]. Not sure if that helps. \n\nWait, but going back to the earlier approach where f(2^{k+1}) = f(2^k) * (a\u00b2 -ab +b\u00b2), and since a and b are powers of 2 and 3, respectively, then a\u00b2 -ab +b\u00b2 is an integer. Therefore, each step from k to k+1 introduces a multiplicative factor that's an integer, hence f(2^{k}) divides f(2^{k+1}). Therefore, by induction, for any n \u2265 m, f(2^m) divides f(2^n). \n\nLet me formalize this induction. Base case: n = m. Then f(2^m) divides itself, which is true. Inductive step: Assume that for some k \u2265 m, f(2^m) divides f(2^k). Then, since f(2^{k+1}) = f(2^k) * (some integer), then f(2^m) divides f(2^{k+1}). Therefore, by induction, it holds for all n \u2265 m. \n\nTherefore, the key idea is that each time we double the exponent (from 2^k to 2^{k+1}), the new f value is a multiple of the previous one. Hence, the divisibility chain is established. \n\nAnother way to see it: The function f(x) has a structure that allows for a recursive multiplicative relationship when x is doubled. This is similar to how geometric sequences work, but here it's more complex due to the combination of different bases. However, the factorization using the difference of cubes allows us to express f(2^{k+1}) in terms of f(2^k), ensuring that each term is a multiple of the previous one. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the proof would involve showing that f(2^{n}) can be expressed as f(2^{n-1}) multiplied by an integer, and thus by induction, all previous terms divide the subsequent ones. Therefore, for m \u2264 n, f(2^m) divides f(2^n).\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nLet's analyze the function \\( f(x) = 4^x + 6^x + 9^x \\).

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. We need to show that if (p-1)(q-1)(r-1) divides pqr - 1 for integers 1 < p < q < r, then the only possible triples are (2,4,8) or (3,5,15). Hmm, interesting. Let's start by understanding what the condition means. \n\nFirst, since p, q, r are integers greater than 1 and in increasing order, they must be at least 2, 3, 4, etc. The product (p-1)(q-1)(r-1) must divide pqr - 1. So, (pqr - 1) divided by (p-1)(q-1)(r-1) must be an integer. Our goal is to find all such triples.\n\nLet me think about small values first. Let's try p=2, since it's the smallest possible. Then p-1=1, so the divisor becomes (1)(q-1)(r-1). So the condition simplifies to (q-1)(r-1) dividing 2qr -1. Let's see if (2,4,8) works here. Then (4-1)(8-1)=3*7=21. 2*4*8=64. 64-1=63. 63 divided by 21 is 3, which is an integer. So that works. Similarly, for (3,5,15): (3-1)(5-1)(15-1)=2*4*14=112. 3*5*15=225. 225-1=224. 224 divided by 112 is 2, which is also an integer. So these two examples fit.\n\nNow, we need to show that these are the only possibilities. Let's think about how to approach this. Maybe start by fixing p and then trying to find possible q and r. Since p is the smallest, starting with p=2, then p=3, etc., might help.\n\nStarting with p=2. Then the divisor becomes (1)(q-1)(r-1). So (q-1)(r-1) divides 2qr -1. Let's denote D = (q-1)(r-1). Then 2qr -1 must be a multiple of D. Let's rearrange this: 2qr \u2261 1 mod D. Since D = (q-1)(r-1), maybe we can find some congruence relations here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe express 2qr -1 = k*(q-1)(r-1) for some integer k. Let's write that equation: 2qr -1 = k(q-1)(r-1). Let's rearrange terms. Let's expand the right-hand side: k(qr - q - r +1). So 2qr -1 = kqr -kq -kr +k. Bringing all terms to one side: (2 -k)qr + kq + kr - (k +1) =0. Hmm, this seems a bit messy. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that since (q-1)(r-1) divides 2qr -1, then 2qr -1 must be greater than or equal to (q-1)(r-1). Let's compute the ratio: (2qr -1)/[(q-1)(r-1)] = k. Let's see what possible values k can take. For example, in the case (2,4,8), k=3. For (3,5,15), k=2. Maybe k is a small integer here. Let's assume k is small, like 1,2,3, etc., and see if we can find solutions.\n\nLet's try k=1. Then 2qr -1 = (q-1)(r-1). Expanding the right side: qr - q - r +1. So 2qr -1 = qr - q - r +1. Rearranging: qr + q + r = 2. But since q and r are at least 3 and 4, this can't happen. So k=1 is impossible.\n\nk=2: 2qr -1 = 2(q-1)(r-1). Let's expand the right side: 2qr -2q -2r +2. So 2qr -1 = 2qr -2q -2r +2. Subtract 2qr from both sides: -1 = -2q -2r +2. Rearranging: 2q + 2r =3. But q and r are at least 3 and 4, so 2*3 +2*4=6+8=14, which is way larger than 3. So no solution here. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Wait, when p=3, the divisor is (3-1)(q-1)(r-1)=2(q-1)(r-1). Then the equation would be 3qr -1 = k*2(q-1)(r-1). But in the given problem, when p=3, q=5, r=15, then 3*5*15=225, 225-1=224. The divisor is 2*4*14=112. 224/112=2, so k=2 here. So maybe for p=3, k=2. But when p=2, k=3. So maybe k varies depending on p.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to approach this differently. Let's consider the general case where p, q, r are in order. Let's denote the divisor as (p-1)(q-1)(r-1) and the dividend as pqr -1. So (pqr -1) must be divisible by (p-1)(q-1)(r-1). Let's denote that ratio as k, so pqr -1 = k(p-1)(q-1)(r-1). Our goal is to find all triples (p,q,r) with 1 < p < q < r satisfying this equation for some integer k.\n\nSince p, q, r are all greater than 1, and in increasing order, let's consider possible small values for p. Let's start with p=2. Then the equation becomes 2qr -1 = k(1)(q-1)(r-1). So 2qr -1 = k(q-1)(r-1). Let's try to find possible q and r here.\n\nLet's take q=4. Then the equation becomes 2*4*r -1 = k(3)(r-1). So 8r -1 = 3k(r-1). Let's rearrange: 8r -1 =3k r -3k. Bring all terms to left: 8r -3k r +3k -1=0. Factor r: r(8 -3k) + (3k -1)=0. So r = (1 -3k)/(8 -3k). Since r must be an integer greater than q=4, let's see possible k values. Let's try k=3: denominator 8-9= -1, numerator 1-9= -8. So r= (-8)/(-1)=8. So r=8. That gives the triple (2,4,8), which is one of the solutions. So that works. What about k=4? Then denominator 8-12= -4, numerator 1-12= -11. So r= (-11)/(-4)=11/4, not integer. k=2: denominator 8-6=2, numerator 1-6= -5. r= -5/2, no. k=1: denominator 8-3=5, numerator 1-3= -2. r= -2/5, no. So only k=3 gives integer r=8. So that's the first solution.\n\nNow, let's check if there are other possible q and r when p=2. Suppose q=3. Then the equation becomes 2*3*r -1 =k(2)(r-1). So 6r -1=2k(r-1). Rearranged: 6r -1=2k r -2k. Bring terms together: 6r -2k r +2k -1=0. Factor r: r(6-2k) + (2k -1)=0. So r=(1-2k)/(6-2k). Let's try k=2: denominator 6-4=2, numerator 1-4= -3. r= -3/2, no. k=3: denominator 6-6=0, division by zero. k=1: denominator 6-2=4, numerator 1-2= -1. r= -1/4, no. So no solutions here. So q=3 doesn't work. Next q=5. Then equation: 2*5*r -1 =k(4)(r-1). 10r -1=4k(r-1). Rearranged: 10r -4k r +4k -1=0. r(10-4k) +4k -1=0. So r=(1-4k)/(10-4k). Let's try k=2: denominator 10-8=2, numerator 1-8= -7. r= -7/2, no. k=3: denominator 10-12= -2, numerator 1-12= -11. r= (-11)/(-2)=11/2, not integer. k=1: denominator 10-4=6, numerator 1-4= -3. r= -3/6= -0.5, no. So no solutions here. So for p=2, the only possible solution is (2,4,8).\n\nNow let's try p=3. Then the divisor is (2)(q-1)(r-1). The equation becomes 3qr -1 =k*2(q-1)(r-1). Let's see if (3,5,15) fits here. 3*5*15=225. 225-1=224. The divisor is 2*4*14=112. 224/112=2, so k=2. Let's verify the equation: 3*5*15 -1=224=2*2*4*14=2*112=224. Correct. Now, let's see if there are other solutions for p=3.\n\nLet's take q=4. Then equation: 3*4*r -1=2k(3)(r-1). So 12r -1=6k(r-1). Rearranged: 12r -6k r +6k -1=0. Factor r: r(12-6k) +6k -1=0. So r=(1-6k)/(12-6k). Simplify denominator and numerator by 6: (1-6k)/(6(2 -k)). Let's try k=2: denominator 12-12=0, division by zero. k=1: denominator 12-6=6, numerator 1-6= -5. r= -5/6, no. k=3: denominator 12-18= -6, numerator 1-18= -17. r= (-17)/(-6)=17/6, no. So no solution here.\n\nNext q=5. Let's see if there's another r when p=3, q=5. Then equation: 3*5*r -1=2k(4)(r-1). So 15r -1=8k(r-1). Rearranged:15r -8k r +8k -1=0. r(15-8k) +8k -1=0. So r=(1-8k)/(15-8k). Let's try k=2: denominator 15-16= -1, numerator 1-16= -15. r= (-15)/(-1)=15. So r=15. That's the solution (3,5,15). Let's check k=3: denominator 15-24= -9, numerator 1-24= -23. r=23/9, not integer. k=1: denominator 15-8=7, numerator 1-8= -7. r= -7/7= -1, invalid. So only k=2 gives r=15. So that's the only solution here.\n\nWhat if we take p=4? Let's see. Then divisor is (3)(q-1)(r-1). The equation becomes 4qr -1 =k*3(q-1)(r-1). Let's try q=5. Then equation:4*5*r -1=3k(4)(r-1). 20r -1=12k(r-1). Rearranged:20r -12k r +12k -1=0. r(20-12k) +12k -1=0. So r=(1-12k)/(20-12k). Let's try k=1: denominator 20-12=8, numerator 1-12= -11. r= -11/8, no. k=2: denominator 20-24= -4, numerator 1-24= -23. r=23/4, no. k=3: denominator 20-36= -16, numerator 1-36= -35. r=35/16, no. So no solution here. Maybe p=4 doesn't yield any solutions.\n\nSimilarly, trying higher p values would likely not yield solutions because the divisor (p-1)(q-1)(r-1) grows faster than pqr -1, making the ratio k smaller, but we need k to be a positive integer. Let's check for p=5. Then divisor is 4(q-1)(r-1). Equation:5qr -1=4k(q-1)(r-1). Let's take q=6. Then equation:5*6*r -1=4k(5)(r-1). 30r -1=20k(r-1). Rearranged:30r -20k r +20k -1=0. r(30-20k) +20k -1=0. So r=(1-20k)/(30-20k). Simplify numerator and denominator by 10: (1-20k)/(10(3-2k)). Let's try k=1: denominator 30-20=10, numerator 1-20= -19. r= -19/10, no. k=2: denominator 30-40= -10, numerator 1-40= -39. r=39/10, no. So no solution here.\n\nIt seems like p=2 and p=3 are the only possible starting points. Let's check if there are other possibilities when p=3 with different q and r. Suppose p=3, q=6. Then equation:3*6*r -1=2k(5)(r-1). 18r -1=10k(r-1). Rearranged:18r -10k r +10k -1=0. r(18-10k) +10k -1=0. So r=(1-10k)/(18-10k). Let's try k=1: denominator 18-10=8, numerator 1-10= -9. r= -9/8, no. k=2: denominator 18-20= -2, numerator 1-20= -19. r=19/2, no. So no solution here.\n\nAnother approach: Let's consider that (p-1)(q-1)(r-1) divides pqr -1. So the ratio k = (pqr -1)/[(p-1)(q-1)(r-1)] must be an integer. Let's analyze possible values of k. For the known solutions:\n\n- For (2,4,8): k= (2*4*8 -1)/(1*3*7)= (64-1)/21=63/21=3.\n- For (3,5,15): k= (3*5*15 -1)/(2*4*14)= (225-1)/112=224/112=2.\n\nSo k=3 and k=2. Let's see if other k values are possible. Suppose k=1. Then (pqr -1) = (p-1)(q-1)(r-1). Let's see if this is possible. For example, take p=2, q=3, r=4. Then left side:2*3*4 -1=24-1=23. Right side:1*2*3=6. 23\u22606. Not possible. Another example: p=2, q=3, r=5. Left:30-1=29. Right:1*2*4=8. No. So k=1 seems impossible.\n\nFor k=4, maybe? Let's see. Take p=2, q=5, r= some number. Then (2*5*r -1)=4*(1*4*(r-1)). So 10r -1=16(r-1). 10r -1=16r -16. Rearranged: -6r = -15 \u2192 r=15/6=2.5, not integer. So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to bound the possible values of p, q, r. Let's think about the ratio k. Since (p-1)(q-1)(r-1) divides pqr -1, then (pqr -1) \u2265 (p-1)(q-1)(r-1). Let's see when this inequality holds. Let's expand the right side: (p-1)(q-1)(r-1) = pqr - pq - pr - qr + p + q + r -1. So the inequality becomes pqr -1 \u2265 pqr - pq - pr - qr + p + q + r -1. Simplify both sides by subtracting pqr -1: 0 \u2265 -pq - pr - qr + p + q + r. Rearranged: pq + pr + qr \u2265 p + q + r. Since p, q, r \u22652, this inequality likely holds. For example, p=2, q=3, r=4: 2*3 +2*4 +3*4=6+8+12=26 \u22652+3+4=9. So yes. So the inequality holds, but we need equality when k=1, which we saw isn't possible. So the ratio k must be at least 2.\n\nBut in our known solutions, k=2 and 3. Let",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The function f is defined on positive integers and gives non-negative integer values. We know some specific values: f(2)=0, f(3)>0, f(9999)=3333. Also, for any m and n, the difference f(m+n) - f(m) - f(n) is either 0 or 1. We need to find f(1982) and show it's 660.\n\nFirst, let's understand the key property: f(m+n) is either f(m)+f(n) or f(m)+f(n)+1. This seems like a subadditive function but with a twist\u2014it can be off by at most 1. Maybe f(n) is related to the floor of some linear function, like floor(n/3) or something similar, but adjusted because of the given values.\n\nGiven f(2)=0 and f(3)>0, let's start with small n. Let's try to compute f(3). Since f(3) must be a non-negative integer and greater than 0, f(3) \u2265 1. Let's see if we can find a pattern or recurrence.\n\nConsider n=1. Wait, but the problem doesn't mention f(1). Hmm. Maybe we can express other values in terms of smaller ones. Let's try building up f(n) step by step.\n\nFor n=2, we know f(2)=0. For n=3, f(3) \u22651. Let's see n=4. 4 can be written as 2+2. So f(4) - f(2) - f(2) is either 0 or 1. Since f(2)=0, f(4) -0 -0 \u2208 {0,1}, so f(4) is 0 or 1. But wait, if f(4) is 0, then maybe that's possible, but let's check other combinations.\n\nAlternatively, 4 can be 3+1. But we don't know f(1). Hmm. Maybe we need to find a general formula. Let's think about the given f(9999)=3333. That's exactly 9999 divided by 3. So 9999/3=3333. That suggests maybe f(n) is roughly n/3, but adjusted. Let's check if that holds for other numbers.\n\nIf n=3, then 3/3=1, which matches f(3)\u22651. For n=2, 2/3 is about 0.666, but f(2)=0. So maybe f(n) is the floor of n/3. But wait, floor(3/3)=1, which matches f(3)\u22651. But floor(2/3)=0, which matches f(2)=0. Let's test this hypothesis.\n\nIf f(n) = floor(n/3), then f(9999)=floor(9999/3)=3333, which matches. Then f(1982)=floor(1982/3)=660.666..., so floor would be 660. That's the answer we need. But we need to verify that this function satisfies the given condition: f(m+n) - f(m) - f(n) is 0 or 1.\n\nWait, floor(m/3 + n/3) versus floor(m/3) + floor(n/3). The difference between floor((m+n)/3) and floor(m/3) + floor(n/3) can be 0 or 1. For example, if m=1 and n=1, then floor(2/3)=0, and floor(1/3)+floor(1/3)=0+0=0, so difference 0. If m=2 and n=2, floor(4/3)=1, and floor(2/3)+floor(2/3)=0+0=0, so difference 1. So yes, the difference is either 0 or 1. Therefore, f(n)=floor(n/3) satisfies the condition.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that f(3) >0. If f(3)=floor(3/3)=1, which is >0, so that's okay. Also, f(2)=0, which matches. So this seems to fit all given conditions. Therefore, f(n)=floor(n/3), so f(1982)=floor(1982/3)=660. Let me confirm 1982 divided by 3: 3*660=1980, so 1982-1980=2, so floor is 660. Yes.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"determine f(1982). Show that it is 660.\" So the answer is 660. The key is to recognize that f(n) is the floor of n divided by 3. The given conditions all align with this function, and the specific value for 9999 confirms it. The condition on the difference f(m+n) - f(m) - f(n) being 0 or 1 is satisfied by the floor function because when you add m and n, their individual floors might sum to either the floor of the sum or one less, hence the difference is 0 or 1. Therefore, the function must be floor(n/3), leading to f(1982)=660.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo determine \\( f(1982) \\), we analyze the given conditions and identify a pattern. The key insight is recognizing that \\( f(n) \\) behaves like the floor of \\( \\frac{n}{3} \\), denoted \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{3} \\right\\rfloor \\). Here's why:\n\n1. **Key Observations**:\n   - \\( f(2) = 0 \\), which matches \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{2}{3} \\right\\rfloor = 0 \\).\n   - \\( f(3) > 0 \\), and \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{3}{3} \\right\\rfloor = 1 \\), satisfying the condition.\n   - \\( f(9999) = 3333 \\), which equals \\( \\frac{9999}{3} = 3333 \\), confirming the floor function directly applies here.\n\n2. **Functional Property**:\n   The condition \\( f(m+n) - f(m) - f(n) \\in \\{0, 1\\} \\) aligns with the floor function's behavior. For integers \\( m, n \\):\n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor \\frac{m+n}{3} \\right\\rfloor - \\left( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{3} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{3} \\right\\rfloor \\right)\n   \\]\n   This difference is always \\( 0 \\) or \\( 1 \\), as the floor operation \"discards\" fractional parts. For example:\n   - If \\( m = 1 \\), \\( n = 1 \\): \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{2}{3} \\right\\rfloor - (0 + 0) = 0 \\).\n   - If \\( m = 2 \\), \\( n = 2 \\): \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{4}{3} \\right\\rfloor - (0 + 0) = 1 \\).\n\n3. **Verification**:\n   - For \\( n = 3k \\), \\( f(n) = k \\).\n   - For \\( n = 3k + 1 \\), \\( f(n) = k \\).\n   - For \\( n = 3k + 2 \\), \\( f(n) = k \\).\n   This matches the floor function \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{3} \\right\\rfloor \\).\n\n4. **Calculation for \\( f(1982) \\)**:\n   Divide \\( 1982 \\) by \\( 3 \\):\n   \\[\n   1982 \\div 3 = 660 \\text{ remainder } 2.\n   \\]\n   Thus, \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{1982}{3} \\right\\rfloor = 660 \\), so \\( f(1982) = 660 \\).\n\n**Conclusion**: The function \\( f(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{3} \\right\\rfloor \\) satisfies all given conditions, and \\( f(1982) = 660 \\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: unexpected token '('; expected '=>'\nunsolved goals\ncase zero\nf : \u2115 \u2192 \u2115\nh\u2080 : \u2200 (m n : \u2115), 0 < m \u2227 0 < n \u2192 f (m + n) - f m - f n = 0 \u2228 f (m + n) - f m - f n = 1\nh\u2081 : f 2 = 0\nh\u2082 : 0 < f 3\nh\u2083 : f 9999 = 3333\nn : \u2115\n\u22a2 f 0 = 0\nunsolved goals\nf : \u2115 \u2192 \u2115\nh\u2080 : \u2200 (m n : \u2115), 0 < m \u2227 0 < n \u2192 f (m + n) - f m - f n = 0 \u2228 f (m + n) - f m - f n = 1\nh\u2081 : f 2 = 0\nh\u2082 : 0 < f 3\nh\u2083 : f 9999 = 3333\nn k : \u2115\nih : f (3 * k) = k\n\u22a2 f (k.succ * 3) = f (3 + k * 3)\nunsolved goals\nf : \u2115 \u2192 \u2115\nh\u2080 : \u2200 (m n : \u2115), 0 < m \u2227 0 < n \u2192 f (m + n) - f m - f n = 0 \u2228 f (m + n) - f m - f n = 1\nh\u2081 : f 2 = 0\nh\u2082 : 0 < f 3\nh\u2083 : f 9999 = 3333\nn k : \u2115\nih : f (3 * k) = k\nthis : f (3 * k.succ) = f (3 * k + 3)\n\u22a2 0 < k\nunsolved goals\ncase zero\nf : \u2115 \u2192 \u2115\nh\u2080 : \u2200 (m n : \u2115), 0 < m \u2227 0 < n \u2192 f (m + n) - f m - f n = 0 \u2228 f (m + n) - f m - f n = 1\nh\u2081 : f 2 = 0\nh\u2082 : 0 < f 3\nh\u2083 : f 9999 = 3333\nn : \u2115\nh\u2085 : \u2200 (k : \u2115), f (3 * k) = k\n\u22a2 f 1 = 0\nunsolved goals\ncase zero\nf : \u2115 \u2192 \u2115\nh\u2080 : \u2200 (m n : \u2115), 0 < m \u2227 0 < n \u2192 f (m + n) - f m - f n = 0 \u2228 f (m + n) - f m - f n = 1\nh\u2081 : f 2 = 0\nh\u2082 : 0 < f 3\nh\u2083 : f 9999 = 3333\nn : \u2115\nh\u2085 : \u2200 (k : \u2115), f (3 * k) = k\nh\u2086 : \u2200 (k : \u2115), f (3 * k + 1) = k\n\u22a2 f 2 = 0\nunsolved goals\ncase zero\nf : \u2115 \u2192 \u2115\nh\u2080 : \u2200 (m n : \u2115), 0 < m \u2227 0 < n \u2192 f (m + n) - f m - f n = 0 \u2228 f (m + n) - f m - f n = 1\nh\u2081 : f 2 = 0\nh\u2082 : 0 < f 3\nh\u2083 : f 9999 = 3333\nh\u2085 : \u2200 (k : \u2115), f (3 * k) = k\nh\u2086 : \u2200 (k : \u2115), f (3 * k + 1) = k\nh\u2087 : \u2200 (k : \u2115), f (3 * k + 2) = k\n\u22a2 f 0 = 0\nunsolved goals\ncase succ.zero\nf : \u2115 \u2192 \u2115\nh\u2080 : \u2200 (m n : \u2115), 0 < m \u2227 0 < n \u2192 f (m + n) - f m - f n = 0 \u2228 f (m + n) - f m - f n = 1\nh\u2081 : f 2 = 0\nh\u2082 : 0 < f 3\nh\u2083 : f 9999 = 3333\nh\u2085 : \u2200 (k : \u2115), f (3 * k) = k\nh\u2086 : \u2200 (k : \u2115), f (3 * k + 1) = k\nh\u2087 : \u2200 (k : \u2115), f (3 * k + 2) = k\n\u22a2 f 1 = 0\nunsolved goals\ncase succ.succ.zero\nf : \u2115 \u2192 \u2115\nh\u2080 : \u2200 (m n : \u2115), 0 < m \u2227 0 < n \u2192 f (m + n) - f m - f n = 0 \u2228 f (m + n) - f m - f n = 1\nh\u2081 : f 2 = 0\nh\u2082 : 0 < f 3\nh\u2083 : f 9999 = 3333\nh\u2085 : \u2200 (k : \u2115), f (3 * k) = k\nh\u2086 : \u2200 (k : \u2115), f (3 * k + 1) = k\nh\u2087 : \u2200 (k : \u2115), f (3 * k + 2) = k\n\u22a2 f 2 = 0\nunsolved goals\nf : \u2115 \u2192 \u2115\nh\u2080 : \u2200 (m n : \u2115), 0 < m \u2227 0 < n \u2192 f (m + n) - f m - f n = 0 \u2228 f (m + n) - f m - f n = 1\nh\u2081 : f 2 = 0\nh\u2082 : 0 < f 3\nh\u2083 : f 9999 = 3333\nh\u2084 : \u2200 (n : \u2115), f n = n / 3\n\u22a2 f 1982 = 660\nPlease revise the proof.",

Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, let's look at the given equation: y\u00b2 + 3x\u00b2y\u00b2 = 30x\u00b2 + 517. Maybe I can factor out y\u00b2 from the left side. That would give y\u00b2(1 + 3x\u00b2) = 30x\u00b2 + 517. Hmm, interesting. So the left side is y\u00b2 multiplied by (3x\u00b2 + 1), and the right side is 30x\u00b2 + 517.\n\nI wonder if I can rearrange this equation to solve for y\u00b2. Let's try that. If I divide both sides by (3x\u00b2 + 1), then y\u00b2 = (30x\u00b2 + 517)/(3x\u00b2 + 1). Since y\u00b2 has to be an integer (because y is an integer), the right-hand side must also be an integer. So (30x\u00b2 + 517) must be divisible by (3x\u00b2 + 1). That seems like a key point.\n\nLet me denote the denominator as D = 3x\u00b2 + 1. Then the numerator is 10*(3x\u00b2) + 517. Wait, 30x\u00b2 is 10*(3x\u00b2), right? So the numerator can be written as 10*(3x\u00b2) + 517. But since D = 3x\u00b2 + 1, maybe I can express the numerator in terms of D. Let's see:\n\nNumerator = 10*(3x\u00b2) + 517 = 10*(D - 1) + 517 = 10D - 10 + 517 = 10D + 507. So then y\u00b2 = (10D + 507)/D = 10 + 507/D. Because 10D/D is 10, and 507/D is the remainder. So y\u00b2 = 10 + 507/(3x\u00b2 + 1).\n\nSince y\u00b2 must be an integer, 507 must be divisible by (3x\u00b2 + 1). Therefore, (3x\u00b2 + 1) must be a divisor of 507. Let's list all the positive divisors of 507. First, factorize 507. 507 divided by 3 is 169. 169 is 13 squared. So 507 = 3 * 13\u00b2. Therefore, the divisors are 1, 3, 13, 39, 169, 507. But since 3x\u00b2 + 1 must be one of these divisors, and 3x\u00b2 + 1 is at least 1 (since x is an integer, x\u00b2 is non-negative, so 3x\u00b2 +1 \u22651). Let's check each possible divisor:\n\nCase 1: 3x\u00b2 +1 = 1. Then 3x\u00b2 = 0 \u2192 x\u00b2=0 \u2192 x=0. Then y\u00b2 = 10 + 507/1 = 517. But 517 is not a perfect square (since 22\u00b2=484, 23\u00b2=529), so no solution here.\n\nCase 2: 3x\u00b2 +1 =3. Then 3x\u00b2=2 \u2192 x\u00b2=2/3. Not possible since x is integer. Disregard.\n\nCase 3: 3x\u00b2 +1=13. Then 3x\u00b2=12 \u2192 x\u00b2=4 \u2192 x=\u00b12. Then y\u00b2=10 +507/13=10 +39=49. 49 is 7\u00b2, so y=\u00b17. This is valid. So possible solutions here: x=\u00b12, y=\u00b17.\n\nCase 4: 3x\u00b2 +1=39. Then 3x\u00b2=38 \u2192 x\u00b2=38/3. Not integer. Disregard.\n\nCase 5: 3x\u00b2 +1=169. Then 3x\u00b2=168 \u2192 x\u00b2=56 \u2192 x=\u00b1\u221a56. But 56 isn't a perfect square. So x isn't integer here. Disregard.\n\nCase 6: 3x\u00b2 +1=507. Then 3x\u00b2=506 \u2192 x\u00b2=506/3 \u2248168.666\u2026 Not integer. Disregard.\n\nSo the only valid cases are when x=\u00b12 and y=\u00b17. Now, compute 3x\u00b2y\u00b2. Let's take x=2 and y=7 (the sign doesn't matter since squared). x\u00b2=4, y\u00b2=49. So 3*4*49 = 3*196 = 588. Similarly for x=-2 and y=-7, same result. Therefore, 3x\u00b2y\u00b2=588. That's the answer.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nWe start with the equation \\( y^2 + 3x^2y^2 = 30x^2 + 517 \\). Factoring \\( y^2 \\) on the left gives \\( y^2(1 + 3x^2) = 30x^2 + 517 \\). Rearranging for \\( y^2 \\), we find:\n\n\\[\ny^2 = \\frac{30x^2 + 517}{3x^2 + 1}.\n\\]\n\nSince \\( y^2 \\) must be an integer, the denominator \\( 3x^2 + 1 \\) must divide the numerator \\( 30x^2 + 517 \\). To exploit this, rewrite the numerator as \\( 10(3x^2) + 517 \\). Substituting \\( D = 3x^2 + 1 \\), the numerator becomes \\( 10(D - 1) + 517 = 10D + 507 \\). Thus:\n\n\\[\ny^2 = 10 + \\frac{507}{3x^2 + 1}.\n\\]\n\nFor \\( y^2 \\) to be an integer, \\( 3x^2 + 1 \\) must divide \\( 507 \\). The divisors of \\( 507 = 3 \\times 13^2 \\) are \\( 1, 3, 13, 39, 169, 507 \\). Testing these:\n\n- **Case \\( 3x^2 + 1 = 13 \\):**  \n  \\( 3x^2 = 12 \\implies x^2 = 4 \\implies x = \\pm 2 \\).  \n  Substituting back, \\( y^2 = 10 + \\frac{507}{13} = 10 + 39 = 49 \\implies y = \\pm 7 \\).\n\nOther divisors either lead to non-integer \\( x \\) or invalid \\( y^2 \\). Thus, the valid solutions are \\( x = \\pm 2 \\), \\( y = \\pm 7 \\). Finally:\n\n\\[\n3x^2y^2 = 3(4)(49) = 588.\n\\]\n\nThis confirms the result.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unexpected token '<;>'; expected ','\nunsolved goals\nx y : \u2124\nh\u2080 : y ^ 2 + 3 * (x ^ 2 * y ^ 2) = 30 * x ^ 2 + 517\nh\u2081 : y ^ 2 = (30 * x ^ 2 + 517) / (3 * x ^ 2 + 1)\nh\u2082 : 3 * x ^ 2 + 1 \u2223 30 * x ^ 2 + 517\nh\u2083 : 3 * x ^ 2 + 1 \u2208 {1, 3, 13, 39, 169, 507}\n\u22a2 3 * (x ^ 2 * y ^ 2) = 588\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unexpected identifier; expected ','\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: simp made no progress\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  (30 * x ^ 2 + 517) / (3 * x ^ 2 + 1)\nx y : \u2124\nh\u2080 : y ^ 2 + 3 * (x ^ 2 * y ^ 2) = 30 * x ^ 2 + 517\nh\u2081 : y ^ 2 = (30 * x ^ 2 + 517) / (3 * x ^ 2 + 1)\n\u22a2 3 * x ^ 2 + 1 \u2223 30 * x ^ 2 + 517\nunsolved goals\nx y : \u2124\nh\u2080 : y ^ 2 + 3 * (x ^ 2 * y ^ 2) = 30 * x ^ 2 + 517\nh\u2081 : y ^ 2 = (30 * x ^ 2 + 517) / (3 * x ^ 2 + 1)\nh\u2082 : 3 * x ^ 2 + 1 \u2223 30 * x ^ 2 + 517\n\u22a2 3 * (x ^ 2 * y ^ 2) = 588\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking for the value of g(f(5) - 1), where f(x) = 2x - 3 and g(x) = x + 1. We need to show that this value is 7.\n\nFirst, I need to remember how function composition works. Since we have g(f(5) - 1), that means we first compute f(5), subtract 1 from that result, and then plug that into g. Let's break it down into smaller steps.\n\nStarting with f(5). The function f is defined as f(x) = 2x - 3. So substituting x with 5, we get f(5) = 2*5 - 3. Let me calculate that: 2 times 5 is 10, and then subtract 3 gives 7. So f(5) is 7. Wait, but then the next step is to subtract 1 from f(5). So 7 minus 1 is 6. Now, we need to find g(6) because the expression is g(f(5) - 1) which is g(6). The function g is g(x) = x + 1. Plugging in 6, we get 6 + 1 = 7. So the final result is 7. That matches what we were supposed to show. \n\nBut let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, f(5) calculation: 2*5 is definitely 10, minus 3 is 7. Correct. Then subtract 1: 7 -1 is 6. Then g(6) is 6 +1, which is 7. Yep, that all adds up. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this by combining the functions first, but since the problem specifically asks for g(f(5) -1), following the order as given is straightforward. Let me also think if there's any possible misunderstanding in the order of operations. The expression g(f(5) -1) means that after computing f(5), we subtract 1 from that result before applying g. So the order is correct: first f(5), then subtract 1, then apply g. \n\nAnother thing to check: the definitions of f and g. The problem states f(x) = 2x -3 and g(x) = x +1. No mistakes there. So substituting 5 into f gives 2*5 -3, which is 10-3=7. Then 7-1=6. Then g(6)=6+1=7. All steps are correct. \n\nI think that's all. Each step follows logically, and the arithmetic checks out. Therefore, the value of g(f(5)-1) is indeed 7.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo find the value of \\( g(f(5) - 1) \\), we proceed step-by-step using the definitions of \\( f(x) = 2x - 3 \\) and \\( g(x) = x + 1 \\).\n\n1. **Compute \\( f(5) \\):**  \n   Substitute \\( x = 5 \\) into \\( f(x) \\):  \n   \\[\n   f(5) = 2(5) - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7.\n   \\]  \n   This simplifies to \\( f(5) = 7 \\).\n\n2. **Subtract 1 from \\( f(5) \\):**  \n   Take the result \\( 7 \\) and subtract \\( 1 \\):  \n   \\[\n   f(5) - 1 = 7 - 1 = 6.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Compute \\( g(6) \\):**  \n   Substitute \\( x = 6 \\) into \\( g(x) \\):  \n   \\[\n   g(6) = 6 + 1 = 7.\n   \\]\n\nBy following these steps, we conclude that \\( g(f(5) - 1) = 7 \\).

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. We need to find the distance between the two points where the parabola y = x\u00b2 intersects the line x + y = 1. The answer should be \u221a10, so I need to verify that.\n\nFirst, I remember that to find intersection points of two curves, I should solve their equations simultaneously. So substitute y from one equation into the other. Let's take the line equation x + y = 1 and solve for y: y = 1 - x. Then plug this into the parabola equation y = x\u00b2. That gives x\u00b2 = 1 - x.\n\nSo the equation becomes x\u00b2 + x - 1 = 0. Wait, no, moving terms around: x\u00b2 + x - 1 = 0? Wait, original substitution: y = x\u00b2 and y = 1 - x. So setting them equal: x\u00b2 = 1 - x. Then bringing all terms to one side: x\u00b2 + x - 1 = 0. Wait, no, x\u00b2 + x - 1 = 0? Let me check again. If x\u00b2 = 1 - x, then x\u00b2 + x - 1 = 0. Yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, solving this quadratic equation. The quadratic formula is x = [-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)]/(2a). Here, a = 1, b = 1, c = -1. So discriminant D = 1\u00b2 - 4*1*(-1) = 1 + 4 = 5. So roots are x = [-1 \u00b1 \u221a5]/2. So two x-values: (-1 + \u221a5)/2 and (-1 - \u221a5)/2.\n\nOnce we have the x-values, we can find the corresponding y-values using y = 1 - x. So for each x, y is 1 minus that x. Let's compute the points.\n\nFirst point: x = (-1 + \u221a5)/2. Then y = 1 - [(-1 + \u221a5)/2] = [2 +1 - \u221a5]/2 = (3 - \u221a5)/2.\n\nSecond point: x = (-1 - \u221a5)/2. Then y = 1 - [(-1 - \u221a5)/2] = [2 +1 + \u221a5]/2 = (3 + \u221a5)/2.\n\nSo the two intersection points are:\n\nPoint A: ((-1 + \u221a5)/2, (3 - \u221a5)/2)\n\nPoint B: ((-1 - \u221a5)/2, (3 + \u221a5)/2)\n\nNow, to find the distance between these two points. The distance formula is sqrt[(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2].\n\nLet's compute the differences first.\n\n\u0394x = [(-1 - \u221a5)/2 - (-1 + \u221a5)/2] = [(-1 - \u221a5 +1 - \u221a5)/2] = (-2\u221a5)/2 = -\u221a5.\n\n\u0394y = [(3 + \u221a5)/2 - (3 - \u221a5)/2] = [3 + \u221a5 -3 + \u221a5]/2 = (2\u221a5)/2 = \u221a5.\n\nSo the differences are \u0394x = -\u221a5 and \u0394y = \u221a5. But when we square them, the signs don't matter. So (\u0394x)^2 = (\u221a5)^2 = 5, and (\u0394y)^2 = (\u221a5)^2 = 5. So total distance squared is 5 + 5 = 10. Therefore, distance is sqrt(10).\n\nWait, let me check that again. The \u0394x is the difference between the x-coordinates. Let me compute it step by step.\n\nPoint A x-coordinate: (-1 + \u221a5)/2\n\nPoint B x-coordinate: (-1 - \u221a5)/2\n\nSubtracting A's x from B's x: [(-1 - \u221a5)/2] - [(-1 + \u221a5)/2] = [(-1 - \u221a5) - (-1 + \u221a5)]/2 = [(-1 - \u221a5 +1 - \u221a5)]/2 = (-2\u221a5)/2 = -\u221a5. So \u0394x is -\u221a5. Similarly for \u0394y.\n\nPoint A y-coordinate: (3 - \u221a5)/2\n\nPoint B y-coordinate: (3 + \u221a5)/2\n\nSubtracting A's y from B's y: [(3 + \u221a5)/2] - [(3 - \u221a5)/2] = [3 + \u221a5 -3 + \u221a5]/2 = (2\u221a5)/2 = \u221a5. So \u0394y is \u221a5.\n\nThen, distance squared is (-\u221a5)^2 + (\u221a5)^2 = 5 + 5 = 10. So sqrt(10). That matches the required answer. So the distance is indeed sqrt(10).\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo find the distance between the two intersection points of the curves \\( y = x^2 \\) and \\( x + y = 1 \\), we first determine their points of intersection by solving the equations simultaneously.\n\n1. **Substitute \\( y = x^2 \\) into \\( x + y = 1 \\):**  \n   This gives \\( x + x^2 = 1 \\), which simplifies to the quadratic equation:  \n   \\[\n   x^2 + x -

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to compute 29^13 minus 5^13 modulo 7 and show that the result is 3. Hmm, let's start by recalling how modular arithmetic works. When dealing with exponents modulo a number, it's often helpful to simplify the base first modulo that number. Since we're working modulo 7, maybe I can reduce 29 and 5 modulo 7 first to make the calculations easier.\n\nFirst, let's find 29 modulo 7. Dividing 29 by 7 gives 4 with a remainder of 1 because 7*4=28 and 29-28=1. So 29 \u2261 1 mod 7. That means 29^13 \u2261 1^13 mod 7. But 1 raised to any power is still 1, so 29^13 \u2261 1 mod 7.\n\nNow, let's look at 5 modulo 7. Well, 5 is already less than 7, so 5 \u2261 5 mod 7. Therefore, 5^13 \u2261 5^13 mod 7. Hmm, calculating 5^13 directly seems tough. Maybe there's a pattern or a theorem that can help here. I remember something about Fermat's little theorem, which says that if p is a prime number, then for any integer a not divisible by p, a^(p-1) \u2261 1 mod p. Since 7 is prime and 5 is not divisible by 7, this applies. So 5^6 \u2261 1 mod 7. Then 5^12 would be (5^6)^2 \u2261 1^2 \u2261 1 mod 7. Then 5^13 = 5^12 * 5 \u2261 1 * 5 \u2261 5 mod 7. So 5^13 \u2261 5 mod 7.\n\nPutting it all together: 29^13 - 5^13 \u2261 1 - 5 mod 7. But 1 - 5 is -4. However, modulo 7, -4 is equivalent to 3 because 7 - 4 = 3. So -4 \u2261 3 mod 7. Therefore, the result should be 3 mod 7.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Did I apply Fermat's theorem correctly? For 5^13, since 5^6 \u2261 1, then 5^6k \u2261 1^k \u2261 1. So 5^12 = (5^6)^2 \u2261 1^2 \u2261 1. Then 5^13 = 5^12 * 5 \u2261 1 * 5 \u2261 5. Yes, that seems right. And 29 \u2261 1 mod 7, so 1^13 is 1. Then 1 - 5 = -4, which is 3 mod 7. Yep, that checks out. I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo compute \\(29^{13} - 5^{13}\\) modulo 7, we first simplify the bases modulo 7:\n\n1. **Simplify \\(29 \\mod 7\\):**  \n   Divide 29 by 7:  \n   \\(29 = 4 \\times 7 + 1\\), so \\(29 \\equiv 1 \\mod 7\\).  \n   Thus, \\(29^{13} \\equiv 1^{13} \\equiv 1 \\mod 7\\).\n\n2. **Simplify \\(5^{13} \\mod 7\\):**  \n   Use Fermat\u2019s Little Theorem, which states that for a prime \\(p\\) and integer \\(a\\) not divisible by \\(p\\):  \n   \\(a^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\mod p\\).  \n   Here, \\(p = 7\\) and \\(a = 5\\), so \\(5^6 \\equiv 1 \\mod 7\\).  \n   Break \\(5^{13}\\) into \\(5^{6 \\times 2 + 1} = (5^6)^2 \\times 5\\).  \n   Substitute using Fermat\u2019s theorem:  \n   \\((5^6)^2 \\times 5 \\equiv 1^2 \\times 5 \\equiv 5 \\mod 7\\).  \n   Hence, \\(5^{13} \\equiv 5 \\mod 7\\).\n\n3. **Combine results:**  \n   Subtract the simplified terms:  \n   \\(29^{13} - 5^{13} \\equiv 1 - 5 \\mod 7\\).  \n   Compute \\(1 - 5 = -4\\).  \n   Convert \\(-4\\) to a positive residue modulo 7:  \n   \\(-4 + 7 = 3\\), so \\(-4 \\equiv 3 \\mod 7\\).\n\nThus, \\(29^{13} - 5^{13} \\equiv 3 \\mod 7\\).  \n**Final Answer:** The result is **3** modulo 7.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, we have two geometric sequences. The first one is 6, a, b, and the second one is 1/b, a, 54. We need to find the value of a and show that it's 3\u221a2. Alright, let's start by recalling what a geometric sequence is. In a geometric sequence, each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant called the common ratio. \n\nLet's denote the common ratio of the first sequence as r. So, starting with 6, the next term is 6*r = a, and then the term after that is a*r = b. So, from the first sequence, we can write:\n\na = 6r  \nb = a*r = 6r * r = 6r\u00b2\n\nNow, let's look at the second geometric sequence: 1/b, a, 54. Let's denote its common ratio as s. So, starting with 1/b, the next term is (1/b)*s = a, and then the term after that is a*s = 54. So, from the second sequence:\n\na = (1/b)*s  \n54 = a*s\n\nWe can express s from the first equation of the second sequence: s = a*b. Then substitute this into the second equation: 54 = a*(a*b) = a\u00b2*b. So, 54 = a\u00b2*b.\n\nBut from the first sequence, we already have b expressed in terms of r: b = 6r\u00b2. Also, since a = 6r, we can substitute both a and b into the equation 54 = a\u00b2*b. Let's do that.\n\nSubstituting a = 6r and b = 6r\u00b2 into 54 = a\u00b2*b:\n\n54 = (6r)\u00b2 * (6r\u00b2)  \n54 = 36r\u00b2 * 6r\u00b2  \n54 = 216r\u2074  \nDivide both sides by 216: 54/216 = r\u2074  \nSimplify 54/216: that's 1/4 = r\u2074  \nSo, r\u2074 = 1/4  \nTaking the fourth root of both sides, since r is positive (as all terms in the sequences are positive), r = (1/4)^(1/4) = (1/2\u00b2)^(1/4) = (1/2)^(1/2) = 1/\u221a2. So, r = 1/\u221a2.\n\nNow, substitute r back into a = 6r:\n\na = 6*(1/\u221a2) = 6/\u221a2. But we can rationalize the denominator: 6/\u221a2 = (6\u221a2)/2 = 3\u221a2. So, a = 3\u221a2. That's the answer we needed to show.\n\nWait, let me check if everything makes sense. Let's verify the sequences with a = 3\u221a2. First sequence: 6, 3\u221a2, b. The common ratio r is a/6 = (3\u221a2)/6 = \u221a2/2 = 1/\u221a2. Then b = a*r = 3\u221a2*(1/\u221a2) = 3. So, the first sequence is 6, 3\u221a2, 3.\n\nNow the second sequence: 1/b, a, 54. Since b = 3, 1/b = 1/3. Then the common ratio s is a/(1/b) = a*b = 3\u221a2*3 = 9\u221a2. Then the next term after a is a*s = 3\u221a2*9\u221a2 = 27*(\u221a2*\u221a2) = 27*2 = 54. That matches the given third term. So both sequences check out. Therefore, a = 3\u221a2 is indeed the correct solution.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nWe are given two geometric sequences of positive real numbers: the first sequence is \\(6, a, b\\) and the second is \\(\\frac{1}{b}, a, 54\\). Our goal is to solve for \\(a\\) and show that \\(a = 3\\sqrt{2}\\).\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first geometric sequence \\(6, a, b\\).**  \nIn a geometric sequence, each term is multiplied by a common ratio \\(r\\). Starting with \\(6\\):  \n- The second term: \\(a = 6 \\cdot r\\).  \n- The third term: \\(b = a \\cdot r = 6r^2\\).  \n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second geometric sequence \\(\\frac{1}{b}, a, 54\\).**  \nLet the common ratio here be \\(s\\). Starting with \\(\\frac{1}{b}\\):  \n- The second term: \\(a = \\frac{1}{b} \\cdot s\\).  \n- The third term: \\(54 = a \\cdot s\\).  \n\nFrom \\(a = \\frac{s}{b}\\), we solve for \\(s\\): \\(s = a \\cdot b\\). Substitute this into \\(54 = a \\cdot s\\):  \n\\[\n54 = a \\cdot (a \\cdot b) \\implies 54 = a^2 \\cdot b.\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Relate \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) using both sequences.**  \nFrom the first sequence, \\(b = 6r^2\\) and \\(a = 6r\\). Substitute \\(b = 6r^2\\) into \\(54 = a^2 \\cdot b\\):  \n\\[\n54 = (6r)^2 \\cdot (6r^2) = 36r^2 \\cdot 6r^2 = 216r^4.\n\\]  \nSimplify:  \n\\[\nr^4 = \\frac{54}{216} = \\frac{1}{4} \\implies r = \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^{1/4} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}.\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Solve for \\(a\\).**  \nSubstitute \\(r = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\) into \\(a = 6r\\):  \n\\[\na = 6 \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{6}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{6\\sqrt{2}}{2} = 3\\sqrt{2}.\n\\]\n\n**Verification:**  \n- First sequence: \\(6, 3\\sqrt{2}, b\\).

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. We need to find the sum of all possible values of h(x), which is the GCD of f(x) = 12x + 7 and g(x) = 5x + 2 for positive integers x. The answer should be 12. Hmm, how do I approach this?\n\nFirst, I remember that the GCD of two numbers also divides their linear combinations. So maybe I can use the Euclidean algorithm here. Let's try that.\n\nIf h(x) divides both f(x) and g(x), then it must divide any combination of them. Let's compute f(x) - 2*g(x). That would be (12x + 7) - 2*(5x + 2) = 12x +7 -10x -4 = 2x +3. So h(x) divides 2x +3.\n\nBut h(x) also divides g(x) =5x +2. So now h(x) divides both 5x +2 and 2x +3. Let's apply the Euclidean algorithm again. Take 5x +2 and subtract 2*(2x +3). That gives 5x +2 -4x -6 = x -4. So h(x) divides x -4.\n\nWait, but h(x) also divides 2x +3. So substituting x =4 +k (since h(x) divides x -4, x must be congruent to 4 mod h(x)), but maybe I should express x in terms of h(x). Let me think differently.\n\nSince h(x) divides x -4, let's say h(x) divides x -4. Then x \u22614 mod h(x). Let's substitute x =4 + m*h(x) for some integer m. But x is a positive integer, so m must be non-negative. Then plugging back into 2x +3: 2*(4 + m*h(x)) +3 =8 +2m*h(x) +3=11 +2m*h(x). Since h(x) divides this, h(x) must divide 11. Because 11 +2m*h(x) divided by h(x) would leave a remainder of 11 mod h(x). So h(x) must divide 11.\n\nBut 11 is prime, so possible h(x) values are 1 and 11. Therefore, the possible GCDs are 1 and 11. Their sum is 12. That matches the answer. But wait, let me check if both 1 and 11 are actually possible.\n\nFirst, check if h(x) can be 11. For that, both f(x) and g(x) must be divisible by 11. Let's set x such that 12x +7 \u22610 mod11 and 5x +2 \u22610 mod11.\n\n12x \u2261 -7 mod11 \u2192 12x \u22614 mod11 (since -7 +11=4). 12 mod11 is 1, so x \u22614 mod11.\n\nSimilarly, 5x +2 \u22610 mod11 \u21925x \u2261-2 mod11 \u21925x \u22619 mod11. Multiply both sides by the inverse of 5 mod11. The inverse of 5 is 9 because 5*9=45\u22611 mod11. So x \u22619*9 \u226181 \u22614 mod11. So x \u22614 mod11. Therefore, when x=4, 15, 26, etc., h(x)=11. For example, x=4: f(4)=12*4+7=55, g(4)=5*4+2=22. GCD(55,22)=11. So yes, possible.\n\nFor other x values not congruent to 4 mod11, the GCD would be 1. For example, x=1: f(1)=19, g(1)=7. GCD(19,7)=1. So yes, both 1 and 11 are possible. Hence sum is 1+11=12.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo determine all possible values of \\( h(x) = \\gcd(12x + 7, 5x + 2) \\) for positive integers \\( x \\), we use properties of the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the Euclidean algorithm. Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Key Insight**: If \\( d = \\gcd(a, b) \\), then \\( d \\) divides any integer combination of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).  \n   Apply this to \\( f(x) = 12x + 7 \\) and \\( g(x) = 5x + 2 \\):\n   - Compute \\( f(x) - 2 \\cdot g(x) = (12x + 7) - 2(5x + 2) = 2x + 3 \\).  \n     Thus, \\( h(x) \\) divides \\( 2x + 3 \\).\n   - Now \\( h(x) \\) divides both \\( 5x + 2 \\) and \\( 2x + 3 \\). Compute another combination:  \n     \\( 5x + 2 - 2(2x + 3) = x - 4 \\).  \n     Hence, \\( h(x) \\) divides \\( x - 4 \\).\n\n2. **Substitute \\( x = 4 + k \\cdot h(x) \\)** (for some integer \\( k \\)) into \\( 2x + 3 \\):  \n   \\( 2(4 + k \\cdot h(x)) + 3 = 11 + 2k \\cdot h(x) \\).  \n   Since \\( h(x) \\) divides this expression, \\( h(x) \\) must divide \\( 11 \\).\n\n3. **Prime Factorization of 11**:  \n   The only divisors of \\( 11 \\) are \\( 1 \\) and \\( 11 \\). Thus, \\( h(x) \\) can only be \\( 1 \\) or \\( 11 \\).\n\n4. **Verify Both Cases**:\n   - **Case 1**: \\( h(x) = 1 \\).  \n     For most \\( x \\), the GCD is \\( 1 \\). Example: \\( x = 1 \\), \\( \\gcd(19, 7) = 1 \\).\n   - **Case 2**: \\( h(x) = 11 \\).  \n     Solve \\( 12x + 7 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11} \\) and \\( 5x + 2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11} \\):  \n     - \\( 12x \\equiv -7 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{11} \\implies x \\equiv 4 \\pmod{11} \\).  \n     - \\( 5x \\equiv -2 \\equiv 9 \\pmod{11} \\implies x \\equiv 4 \\pmod{11} \\).  \n     Thus, \\( x \\equiv 4 \\pmod{11} \\) satisfies both conditions. Example: \\( x = 4 \\), \\( \\gcd(55, 22) = 11 \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The possible values of \\( h(x) \\) are \\( 1 \\) and \\( 11 \\). Their sum is \\( 1 + 11 = 12 \\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: \nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: The rfl tactic failed.

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking for the value of the expression (log\u208280 / log\u2084\u20802) - (log\u2082160 / log\u2082\u20802), and we need to show that it's equal to 2, which is option D. \n\nFirst, I remember that logarithms with different bases can sometimes be converted using the change of base formula. The context provided includes a proof of the change of base formula, which might be useful here. Let me recall that formula. The change of base formula states that log_b a = log_c a / log_c b for any positive number a, and bases b and c not equal to 1. So, this allows us to express a logarithm in one base in terms of another base. \n\nLooking at the given expression, both terms are fractions where the numerator and denominator are logarithms with different bases. Let's take the first term: log\u208280 divided by log\u2084\u20802. If I apply the change of base formula to the denominator, log\u2084\u20802, I can write it as log\u20822 / log\u208240. Wait, but log\u20822 is 1, so log\u2084\u20802 = 1 / log\u208240. Therefore, the first term becomes log\u208280 multiplied by log\u208240. Because dividing by (1/log\u208240) is the same as multiplying by log\u208240. \n\nSimilarly, the second term is log\u2082160 divided by log\u2082\u20802. Applying the same logic, log\u2082\u20802 is 1 / log\u208220, so this term becomes log\u2082160 multiplied by log\u208220. \n\nSo now the original expression simplifies to (log\u208280 * log\u208240) - (log\u2082160 * log\u208220). \n\nHmm, maybe there's a way to simplify these products. Let's compute each logarithm separately. Let's break down the numbers into factors of 2 and 5, since 40 is 8*5, 80 is 16*5, etc. \n\nStarting with log\u208280: 80 is 16*5, which is 2^4 *5. So log\u208280 = log\u2082(2^4 *5) = log\u20822^4 + log\u20825 = 4 + log\u20825. \n\nSimilarly, log\u208240: 40 is 8*5, which is 2^3 *5. So log\u208240 = 3 + log\u20825. \n\nThen log\u2082160: 160 is 32*5, which is 2^5 *5. So log\u2082160 = 5 + log\u20825. \n\nLog\u208220: 20 is 4*5, which is 2^2 *5. So log\u208220 = 2 + log\u20825. \n\nSo substituting these back into the expression:\n\nFirst term: (4 + log\u20825) * (3 + log\u20825)\n\nSecond term: (5 + log\u20825) * (2 + log\u20825)\n\nSo the expression becomes [(4 + L)(3 + L)] - [(5 + L)(2 + L)] where L = log\u20825.\n\nLet me expand these products:\n\nFirst product: 4*3 + 4L + 3L + L\u00b2 = 12 + 7L + L\u00b2\n\nSecond product: 5*2 + 5L + 2L + L\u00b2 = 10 + 7L + L\u00b2\n\nSubtracting the second product from the first: (12 +7L + L\u00b2) - (10 +7L + L\u00b2) = 12 -10 +7L -7L + L\u00b2 - L\u00b2 = 2. \n\nSo the entire expression simplifies to 2. Therefore, the answer is D) 2. \n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Let me check if I made any mistakes in the algebra. \n\nYes, when expanding (4 + L)(3 + L), it's 4*3 +4L +3L +L\u00b2 =12 +7L +L\u00b2. Similarly for the others. Then subtracting gives 12 -10 =2, and the other terms cancel. So yes, the difference is indeed 2. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a smarter way using logarithm properties instead of expanding. Let me think. \n\nAlternatively, notice that each term in the original expression is of the form (log\u2082A)/(log_B2). Let's consider each fraction. For example, log\u208280 / log\u2084\u20802. Let's use the change of base formula on log\u2084\u20802. As log\u2084\u20802 = 1 / log\u208240, so the first fraction becomes log\u208280 * log\u208240. Similarly, the second fraction is log\u2082160 * log\u208220. \n\nSo the expression is log\u208280 * log\u208240 - log\u2082160 * log\u208220. \n\nBut perhaps there's a relationship between these terms. Let's note that 80 * 20 = 1600, and 160 *40 = 6400. Not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe express each term in terms of log\u20825. \n\nWait, but the way I did it before worked. Expanding the products and subtracting gives 2. So that's correct. Therefore, the answer is 2.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nLet's evaluate the expression step by step using logarithm properties and the change of base formula. The goal is to simplify:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\log_2 80}{\\log_{40}2} - \\frac{\\log_2 160}{\\log_{20}2}.\n\\]\n\n**Step 1: Apply the change of base formula to denominators.**  \nRecall that \\(\\log_b a = \\frac{1}{\\log_a b}\\).

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a function f where for any real number x, f(x) + f(x-1) equals x squared. We know that f(19) is 94, and we need to find the remainder when f(94) is divided by 1000. The answer should be 561. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the key equation here is f(x) + f(x-1) = x\u00b2. This is a recurrence relation that connects the value of the function at x with its value at x-1. Since we know f(19), maybe we can use this relation to find other values of f leading up to f(94). But 94 is much larger than 19, so we need a way to iterate this relation upwards.\n\nLet me think. If I can express f(x) in terms of f(x-1), then maybe I can create a sequence of equations. Let's rearrange the original equation to solve for f(x):\n\nf(x) = x\u00b2 - f(x-1)\n\nYes, that makes sense. So each term f(x) is the square of x minus the previous term f(x-1). This looks like a recursive formula where each term depends on the one before it. So if we start at x=19, we can compute f(20) = 20\u00b2 - f(19). Since f(19) is 94, f(20) would be 400 - 94 = 306. Then f(21) = 21\u00b2 - f(20) = 441 - 306 = 135. Continuing this way, we could compute f(22), f(23), and so on up to f(94). But doing this manually for 94 - 19 = 75 steps would be tedious. There must be a pattern or a closed-form formula here.\n\nWait, maybe there's a way to find a general expression for f(n) in terms of n. Let's try to see if there's a pattern when we compute a few terms. Let's start with f(19) = 94.\n\nCompute f(20) = 20\u00b2 - f(19) = 400 - 94 = 306\n\nf(21) = 21\u00b2 - f(20) = 441 - 306 = 135\n\nf(22) = 22\u00b2 - f(21) = 484 - 135 = 349\n\nf(23) = 23\u00b2 - f(22) = 529 - 349 = 180\n\nf(24) = 24\u00b2 - f(23) = 576 - 180 = 396\n\nf(25) = 25\u00b2 - f(24) = 625 - 396 = 229\n\nHmm, the values are oscillating. Let's see if there's a pattern here. Maybe we can write out the terms and look for a recurrence relation that can be solved.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the recurrence relation f(x) + f(x-1) = x\u00b2. This is a linear recurrence, but it's nonhomogeneous because of the x\u00b2 term. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is f(x) + f(x-1) = 0. The characteristic equation would be r + 1 = 0, so r = -1. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is f_h(x) = A(-1)^x, where A is a constant.\n\nNow, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is x\u00b2, a quadratic polynomial, let's assume the particular solution is a quadratic function: f_p(x) = ax\u00b2 + bx + c. Plugging this into the equation:\n\nf_p(x) + f_p(x-1) = x\u00b2\n\nSo, [ax\u00b2 + bx + c] + [a(x-1)\u00b2 + b(x-1) + c] = x\u00b2\n\nExpanding the second term:\n\na(x\u00b2 - 2x + 1) + b(x - 1) + c = a x\u00b2 - 2a x + a + b x - b + c\n\nAdding the two parts:\n\nax\u00b2 + bx + c + a x\u00b2 - 2a x + a + b x - b + c = x\u00b2\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(ax\u00b2 + a x\u00b2) + (bx - 2a x + b x) + (c + a - b + c) = x\u00b2\n\nSimplify:\n\n2a x\u00b2 + (2b - 2a) x + (2c + a - b) = x\u00b2\n\nSet coefficients equal on both sides:\n\nFor x\u00b2: 2a = 1 \u21d2 a = 1/2\n\nFor x: 2b - 2a = 0 \u21d2 2b = 2a \u21d2 b = a = 1/2\n\nFor constant term: 2c + a - b = 0. Since a = b = 1/2, substitute:\n\n2c + (1/2) - (1/2) = 2c = 0 \u21d2 c = 0\n\nTherefore, the particular solution is f_p(x) = (1/2)x\u00b2 + (1/2)x.\n\nSo the general solution is f(x) = f_p(x) + f_h(x) = (1/2)x\u00b2 + (1/2)x + A(-1)^x.\n\nNow we can use the initial condition to find A. Wait, but we have f(19) = 94. Let's plug x = 19 into the general solution:\n\n94 = (1/2)(19\u00b2) + (1/2)(19) + A(-1)^19\n\nCalculate each term:\n\n19\u00b2 = 361, so (1/2)(361) = 180.5\n\n(1/2)(19) = 9.5\n\n(-1)^19 = -1, so A(-1)^19 = -A\n\nSo:\n\n180.5 + 9.5 - A = 94\n\n190 - A = 94 \u21d2 A = 190 - 94 = 96\n\nTherefore, the general formula is:\n\nf(x) = (1/2)x\u00b2 + (1/2)x + 96(-1)^x\n\nNow, we need to compute f(94) using this formula and find the remainder when divided by 1000.\n\nLet's compute each term:\n\nFirst term: (1/2)(94)^2\n\n94 squared: 94*94. Let's compute that. 90\u00b2=8100, 4\u00b2=16, and cross term 2*90*4=720. So (90+4)^2 = 90\u00b2 + 2*90*4 +4\u00b2 = 8100 + 720 +16=8836. So (1/2)(8836)=4418\n\nSecond term: (1/2)(94) = 47\n\nThird term: 96*(-1)^94. Since 94 is even, (-1)^94 = 1. So 96*1=96\n\nAdd them up: 4418 + 47 + 96 = 4418 + 47 is 4465, plus 96 is 4561.\n\nWait, but the problem states the remainder when divided by 1000 is 561. 4561 divided by 1000 is 4 with remainder 561. So yes, the remainder is 561.\n\nBut let me double-check the calculations to be sure.\n\nFirst term: 94\u00b2 is 8836. Half of that is 4418. Correct.\n\nSecond term: 94/2 = 47. Correct.\n\nThird term: 96*(-1)^94. Since 94 is even, it's 96*1=96. Correct.\n\nSum: 4418 +47 = 4465. Then 4465 +96=4561. The remainder when divided by 1000 is 561.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the answer is 561.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo solve for the remainder when \\( f(94) \\) is divided by 1000, we start with the given recurrence relation \\( f(x) + f(x-1) = x^2 \\) and the initial condition \\( f(19) = 94 \\). \n\nFirst, observe that the recurrence can be rewritten as \\( f(x) = x^2 - f(x-1) \\). This allows us to compute subsequent values of \\( f \\) iteratively. However, manually computing \\( f(94) \\) from \\( f(19) \\) would require 75 steps, which is impractical. Instead, we derive a closed-form solution for \\( f(x) \\).\n\nThe recurrence is linear and nonhomogeneous. We solve it by finding:\n1. **Homogeneous solution**: The homogeneous equation \\( f(x) + f(x-1) = 0 \\) has the solution \\( f_h(x) = A(-1)^x \\), where \\( A \\) is a constant.\n2. **Particular solution**: Assume a quadratic particular solution \\( f_p(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \\). Substituting into the recurrence and equating coefficients, we find \\( a = \\frac{1}{2} \\), \\( b = \\frac{1}{2} \\), and \\( c = 0 \\). Thus, \\( f_p(x) = \\frac{1}{2}x^2 + \\frac{1}{2}x \\).\n\nThe general solution combines these:\n\\[\nf(x) = \\frac{1}{2}x^2 + \\frac{1}{2}x + A(-1)^x.\n\\]\n\nUsing \\( f(19) = 94 \\), we solve for \\( A \\):\n\\[\n94 = \\frac{1}{2}(19^2) + \\frac{1}{2}(19) + A(-1)^{19}.\n\\]\nSimplifying:\n\\[\n94 = 180.5 + 9.5 - A \\implies A = 96.\n\\]\n\nThus, the explicit formula is:\n\\[\nf(x) = \\frac{1}{2}x^2 + \\frac{1}{2}x + 96(-1)^x.\n\\]\n\nFinally, compute \\( f(94) \\):\n\\[\nf(94) = \\frac{1}{2}(94^2) + \\frac{1}{2}(94) + 96(-1)^{94}.\n\\]\nSince \\( (-1)^{94} = 1 \\), this simplifies to:\n\\[\nf(94) = 4418 + 47 + 96 = 4561.\n\\]\nThe remainder when \\( 4561 \\) is divided by 1000 is **561**.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown tactic\nfailed to synthesize\n  HAdd \u2124 \u2124 ?m.98\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  OfNat \u2124 19\nnumerals are polymorphic in Lean, but the numeral `19` cannot be used in a context where the expected type is\n  \u2124\ndue to the absence of the instance above\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  OfNat \u2124 94\nnumerals are polymorphic in Lean, but the numeral `94` cannot be used in a context where the expected type is\n  \u2124\ndue to the absence of the instance above\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  OfNat \u2124 94\nnumerals are polymorphic in Lean, but the numeral `94` cannot be used in a context where the expected type is\n  \u2124\ndue to the absence of the instance above\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  OfNat \u2124 561\nnumerals are polymorphic in Lean, but the numeral `561` cannot be used in a context where the expected type is\n  \u2124\ndue to the absence of the instance above\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  HSub \u2124 Nat \u2124\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  HMod \u2124 Nat \u2124\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nunsolved goals\n\u2124 : Type u_1\nx : \u2124\nf : \u2124 \u2192 \u2124\nh0 : sorryAx (Sort u_2) true\nh1 : f (sorryAx \u2124 true) = 94\n\u22a2 f (sorryAx \u2124 true) % 1000 = 561\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is to find the point where the two lines s = 9 - 2t and t = 3s + 1 intersect. They want the answer as an ordered pair (s, t), and we need to show it's (1,4). \n\nFirst, I remember that to find the intersection of two lines, you need to solve the system of equations simultaneously. So here, we have two equations with variables s and t. Since each equation expresses one variable in terms of the other, substitution seems like the way to go.\n\nLooking at the first equation, s is given in terms of t: s = 9 - 2t. The second equation gives t in terms of s: t = 3s + 1. So maybe substitute the expression for s from the first equation into the second equation. That way, we can solve for t first, then find s.\n\nLet me try that. Substitute s = 9 - 2t into the second equation. So, t = 3*(9 - 2t) + 1. Let's compute that. 3 times 9 is 27, and 3 times -2t is -6t. So, t = 27 - 6t + 1. Combine the constants: 27 + 1 is 28. So, t = 28 - 6t.\n\nNow, solve for t. Bring the -6t to the left side by adding 6t to both sides: t + 6t = 28. That gives 7t = 28. Divide both sides by 7: t = 4. Okay, so t is 4. Now plug this back into the first equation to find s. s = 9 - 2*(4) = 9 - 8 = 1. So s is 1. Therefore, the intersection point is (1,4). \n\nWait, but let me check if this makes sense. Let's verify both equations with s=1 and t=4. First equation: s = 9 - 2t. Plugging t=4: 9 - 8 = 1, which matches s=1. Second equation: t = 3s + 1. Plugging s=1: 3*1 +1 = 4, which matches t=4. So both equations are satisfied. That seems correct.\n\nI don't see any mistakes here. The substitution method worked because each equation was solved for one variable, making substitution straightforward. The key steps were substituting s from the first equation into the second, solving for t, then back-substituting to find s. The verification step confirms that the solution satisfies both original equations. So the intersection point is indeed (1,4).\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo find where the lines \\( s = 9 - 2t \\) and \\( t = 3s + 1 \\) intersect, we need to solve these equations simultaneously.

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the sum of the two values of x that satisfy the equation (x + 3)^2 = 121, and show that the sum is -6. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an equation like a squared term equals a number, you can take the square root of both sides to solve for the variable. But wait, when you take the square root, you have to consider both the positive and negative roots. So for (x + 3)^2 = 121, taking the square root of both sides would give x + 3 = \u00b1\u221a121. Since \u221a121 is 11, that means x + 3 could be 11 or -11. Then, solving for x in each case would give the two solutions.\n\nLet me write that out step by step. If x + 3 = 11, then subtracting 3 from both sides gives x = 8. If x + 3 = -11, then subtracting 3 gives x = -14. So the two solutions are x = 8 and x = -14. Adding those together, 8 + (-14) equals -6. That matches the answer we need to show. But maybe there's a quicker way to find the sum without finding each root individually?\n\nOh right! There's a theorem called Vieta's formulas that relates the sum and product of the roots of a quadratic equation to its coefficients. For a quadratic equation in the form ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0, the sum of the roots is -b/a. Let me check if I can apply that here.\n\nBut the given equation is (x + 3)^2 = 121. To use Vieta's formulas, I need to rewrite it in the standard quadratic form. Let's expand the left side: (x + 3)^2 is x\u00b2 + 6x + 9. So the equation becomes x\u00b2 + 6x + 9 = 121. Subtract 121 from both sides to set it to zero: x\u00b2 + 6x + 9 - 121 = 0, which simplifies to x\u00b2 + 6x - 112 = 0. Now, in the standard form ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0, a is 1, b is 6, and c is -112. According to Vieta's formula, the sum of the roots is -b/a = -6/1 = -6. So that directly gives the sum as -6 without having to find each root. That's much faster!\n\nWait, but maybe I should verify this by solving the equation both ways to make sure. Let's do that. First, expanding and solving:\n\nOriginal equation: (x + 3)^2 = 121\nTake square roots: x + 3 = \u00b111\nSo x = -3 \u00b111\nWhich gives x = -3 + 11 = 8 and x = -3 -11 = -14\nSum: 8 + (-14) = -6. Yep, same result.\n\nAlternatively, using Vieta's formula after expanding to x\u00b2 + 6x - 112 = 0, sum is -6/1 = -6. Both methods confirm the sum is -6. So either way works. The problem probably expects using Vieta's formula since it's quicker, but showing both methods might be thorough.\n\nBut the problem specifically asks to show that the sum is -6, so either approach is valid. However, since the context provided earlier shows an example of solving a quadratic by factoring, maybe expanding and solving is the expected method here. But Vieta's is more efficient. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to see the sum without expanding. Let's think. The original equation is (x + 3)^2 = 121. Let me let y = x + 3. Then the equation becomes y\u00b2 = 121, so y = \u00b111. Therefore, the solutions for y are 11 and -11. Then, since y = x + 3, the solutions for x are y - 3, which would be 11 - 3 = 8 and -11 -3 = -14. Summing these gives 8 + (-14) = -6. So even without expanding, by substitution, we can find the sum.\n\nBut in all cases, the sum comes out to -6. So the key idea is that when you have a quadratic equation, the sum of the roots can be found using Vieta's formula, which is derived from the coefficients. Alternatively, solving for each root and adding them also works. Either method is valid here. The problem might want the student to recognize that expanding the equation into standard quadratic form allows applying Vieta's formula, leading directly to the sum without calculating each root. That's probably the more elegant approach.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the steps would be:\n\n1. Expand the given equation to standard quadratic form.\n2. Identify coefficients a and b.\n3. Apply Vieta's formula for the sum of roots (-b/a).\n4. Alternatively, solve for each root and add them.\n\nEither method leads to the conclusion that the sum is -6. The problem statement wants us to show that it is indeed -6, so either approach suffices. Since Vieta's is quicker, that's the preferred method here.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo find the sum of the two values of \\( x \\) that satisfy \\( (x+3)^2 = 121 \\), we can use two approaches: solving for the roots directly or applying Vieta\u2019s formulas. Both methods confirm the sum is \\(-6\\).\n\n**Method 1: Solving for the roots**  \n1. Start with the equation:  \n   \\[\n   (x + 3)^2 = 121.\n   \\]  \n2.

Let me recall what that is.\n\nFrom what I remember, a number is divisible by 11 if the difference between the sum of the digits in the odd positions and the sum of the digits in the even positions is a multiple of 11, including zero. So, for example, take a number like 121. The sum of the digits in the odd positions (1st and 3rd) is 1 + 1 = 2, and the even position (2nd) is 2. The difference is 2 - 2 = 0, which is a multiple of 11, so 121 is divisible by 11.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that. Maybe the rule is alternating sum. Like, subtract and add digits alternately. Let me check. Suppose the number is abcdef. Then the rule is (a + c + e) - (b + d + f) should be divisible by 11. Yeah, that's right. So for a four-digit number, say abcd, it would be (a + c) - (b + d) must be a multiple of 11.\n\nSo applying that to the number 20_7. Let's parse the positions. The digits are in positions 1, 2, 3, 4. So positions 1 and 3 are odd, positions 2 and 4 are even. The number is 2 (position 1), 0 (position 2), blank (position 3), 7 (position 4). Wait, no. Wait, the number is 20_7. Wait, how many digits? It's a four-digit integer. So the digits are: first digit is 2, second is 0, third is the blank, fourth is 7. So positions 1:2, 2:0, 3:x (unknown digit), 4:7.\n\nSo according to the divisibility rule for 11, the sum of digits in odd positions (positions 1 and 3) minus the sum of digits in even positions (positions 2 and 4) should be a multiple of 11 (including zero). So that would be (2 + x) - (0 + 7) = (2 + x) - 7. This difference needs to be a multiple of 11. So (2 + x - 7) = (x - 5) must be 0 or \u00b111, \u00b122, etc. But since x is a single digit (0-9), x - 5 can only be between -5 and 4. So the only possible multiple of 11 in that range is 0. Therefore, x - 5 = 0 \u2192 x = 5. Hence, the digit must be 5.\n\nWait, let me verify that again. Let's substitute x=5 into the number: 2057. Let's check if 2057 is divisible by 11. Let's compute 2057 \u00f7 11. 11 \u00d7 186 = 2046. 2057 - 2046 = 11. So 11 \u00d7 187 = 2057. Yes, that works. So 2057 is indeed divisible by 11. Therefore, the digit must be 5.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check the divisibility rule again. Let's take the number 2057. Sum of odd positions: 2 (position 1) + 5 (position 3) = 7. Sum of even positions: 0 (position 2) + 7 (position 4) = 7. The difference is 7 - 7 = 0, which is a multiple of 11. So yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 5. That seems straightforward. But let me make sure there's no other possible digit. Suppose x was 5 + 11 = 16, but that's not a digit. Similarly, 5 - 11 = -6, which is also not a digit. So the only possible value is 5. Hence, the blank must be filled with 5.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo determine the digit \\( x \\) that makes the four-digit number \\( 20\\_7 \\) a multiple of 11, we use the divisibility rule for 11: **the alternating sum of the digits (sum of digits in odd positions minus sum of digits in even positions) must be a multiple of 11, including zero**.\n\n1. **Identify digit positions**:\n   - Position 1 (odd): \\( 2 \\)\n   - Position 2 (even): \\( 0 \\)\n   - Position 3 (odd): \\( x \\)\n   - Position 4 (even): \\( 7 \\)\n\n2. **Apply the divisibility rule**:\n   - Sum of odd positions: \\( 2 + x \\)\n   - Sum of even positions: \\( 0 + 7 = 7 \\)\n   - Difference: \\( (2 + x) - 7 = x - 5 \\).\n\n3. **Solve for \\( x \\)**:\n   - For the number to be divisible by 11, \\( x - 5 \\) must equal \\( 0 \\) or \\( \\pm 11, \\pm 22, \\ldots \\).\n   - Since \\( x \\) is a single digit (0-9), the only valid solution is \\( x - 5 = 0 \\), so \\( x = 5 \\).\n\n4. **Verification**:\n   - Substitute \\( x = 5 \\) into \\( 20\\_7 \\), giving \\( 2057 \\).\n   - Check divisibility: \\( 2057 \\div 11 = 187 \\), confirming it is indeed divisible by 11.\n\nThus, the required digit is **5**. No other digit satisfies the condition, as values like \\( 5 \\pm 11 \\) exceed the range of single digits.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unsolved goals\nn : \u2115\nh\u2080 : n \u2264 9\nh\u2081

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem: find the remainder when 129^34 + 96^38 is divided by 11, and show that it's 9. Hmm, modular arithmetic, right? Since we're dealing with division by 11, I remember that there are some properties we can use here.\n\nFirst, maybe I should simplify each term modulo 11 before dealing with the exponents. Because calculating 129^34 directly would be a huge number, but modulo 11, things cycle. Let me start with 129 mod 11. Let's divide 129 by 11. 11*11 is 121, so 129 - 121 is 8. So 129 \u2261 8 mod 11. Similarly, 96 divided by 11: 11*8 is 88, so 96 - 88 = 8. So 96 \u2261 8 mod 11. Wait, both are congruent to 8 mod 11? Interesting. So the problem becomes 8^34 + 8^38 mod 11.\n\nNow, let's handle the exponents. Since we're working modulo 11, maybe Fermat's Little Theorem applies. Fermat's says that if p is prime and a is not divisible by p, then a^(p-1) \u2261 1 mod p. Here, 11 is prime, and 8 is not divisible by 11, so 8^10 \u2261 1 mod 11. So exponents can be reduced modulo 10. Let's see:\n\nFor 8^34: 34 divided by 10 is 3 with remainder 4. So 34 = 10*3 + 4. Therefore, 8^34 \u2261 (8^10)^3 * 8^4 \u2261 1^3 * 8^4 \u2261 8^4 mod 11.\n\nSimilarly, 8^38: 38 divided by 10 is 3 with remainder 8. So 38 = 10*3 +8. Thus, 8^38 \u2261 (8^10)^3 *8^8 \u22611^3 *8^8 \u22618^8 mod 11.\n\nSo now we need to compute 8^4 +8^8 mod 11. Let's compute these powers step by step.\n\nCompute 8^2 first: 8^2 =64. 64 mod 11: 11*5=55, 64-55=9. So 8^2 \u22619 mod11.\n\nThen 8^4 = (8^2)^2 \u22619^2=81. 81 mod11: 11*7=77, 81-77=4. So 8^4 \u22614 mod11.\n\nNext, 8^8: Let's compute 8^4 first, which we have as 4. Then 8^8 = (8^4)^2 \u22614^2=16. 16 mod11=5. So 8^8 \u22615 mod11.\n\nTherefore, 8^4 +8^8 \u22614 +5=9 mod11. So the sum is congruent to 9 mod11. Hence, the remainder is 9. That matches what we needed to show. Let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, 129 mod11: 11*11=121, 129-121=8. Correct. 96 mod11: 11*8=88, 96-88=8. Correct. Then using Fermat's Little Theorem, exponent cycles of 10. Breaking down 34 and 38 into multiples of 10 plus remainder. Then computing each power step by step. 8^2=64\u22619, 8^4=9^2=81\u22614, 8^8=4^2=16\u22615. Adding 4+5=9. All steps seem correct. So the remainder is indeed 9.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo find the remainder when \\(129^{34} + 96^{38}\\) is divided by \\(11\\), we use modular arithmetic and Fermat's Little Theorem. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Simplify the bases modulo 11**:\n   - \\(129 \\div 11\\) leaves a remainder of \\(8\\), so \\(129 \\equiv 8 \\pmod{11}\\).\n   - \\(96 \\div 11\\) also leaves a remainder of \\(8\\), so \\(96 \\equiv 8 \\pmod{11}\\).\n\n   This reduces the problem to finding \\(8^{34} + 8^{38} \\pmod{11}\\).\n\n2. **Apply Fermat\u2019s Little Theorem**:\n   Since \\(11\\) is prime and \\(8\\) is not divisible by \\(11\\), Fermat\u2019s Little Theorem tells us \\(8^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}\\).

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have an arithmetic sequence where the first term is 2/3 and the ninth term is 4/5. We need to find the fifth term and show that it's 11/15.\n\nFirst, I remember that in an arithmetic sequence, each term is obtained by adding a common difference to the previous term. The general formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d, where a_1 is the first term and d is the common difference.\n\nGiven that the first term (a_1) is 2/3, and the ninth term (a_9) is 4/5, I can plug these into the formula. For the ninth term, n=9, so:\n\na_9 = a_1 + (9-1)d\n4/5 = 2/3 + 8d\n\nNow, I need to solve for d. Subtract 2/3 from both sides:\n\n4/5 - 2/3 = 8d\n\nTo subtract these fractions, find a common denominator, which is 15:\n\n(12/15 - 10/15) = 8d\n2/15 = 8d\n\nThen, divide both sides by 8:\n\nd = (2/15) / 8 = 2/(15*8) = 1/60\n\nWait, that seems really small. Let me check that again. 4/5 is 12/15, 2/3 is 10/15. 12/15 -10/15 is 2/15. Then 2/15 divided by 8 is indeed (2/15)*(1/8) = 2/120 = 1/60. Okay, so d is 1/60.\n\nNow, to find the fifth term (a_5), use the formula again with n=5:\n\na_5 = a_1 + (5-1)d\na_5 = 2/3 + 4*(1/60)\n\nCalculate 4*(1/60) = 4/60 = 1/15\n\nSo, a_5 = 2/3 + 1/15. Convert 2/3 to fifteenths: 10/15 + 1/15 = 11/15. That matches the answer we need to show. \n\nWait, but let me make sure there's no mistake here. Let me verify each step again. The common difference calculation: yes, 8d = 2/15, so d=1/60. Then adding four times that to the first term. 4*(1/60) is 4/60=1/15. Adding to 2/3: 2/3 is 10/15, plus 1/15 is 11/15. Yep, that's correct. So the fifth term is indeed 11/15.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nWe start by recalling that in an arithmetic sequence, each term increases by a constant difference \\( d \\).

\\frac{2}{3} = 8d.\n\\]\nConvert to a common denominator (15):\n\\[\n\\frac{12}{15} - \\frac{10}{15} = 8d \\implies \\frac{2}{15} = 8d.\n\\]\nSolve for \\( d \\):\n\\[\nd = \\frac{2}{15} \\div 8 = \\frac{1}{60}.\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Compute the fifth term (\\( a_5 \\)).**  \nUsing \\( n = 5 \\):\n\\[\na_5 = \\frac{2}{3} + (5-1) \\cdot \\frac{1}{60} = \\frac{2}{3} + \\frac{4}{60}.\n\\]\nSimplify \\( \\frac{4}{60} = \\frac{1}{15} \\), and convert \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\) to fifteenths:\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{10}{15} \\implies \\frac{10}{15} + \\frac{1}{15} = \\frac{11}{15}.\n\\]\nThus, the fifth term is \\( \\frac{11}{15} \\), as required.\nPrevious attempt failed with: linarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase h1.h\na : \u2115 \u2192 \u211d\nh\u2080 : \u2200 (n : \u2115), a (n + 2) -

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the smallest integer greater than 10 that's both a perfect square and a perfect cube. The answer is supposed to be 64, but I need to show why. Let me start by recalling what perfect squares and cubes are.\n\nA perfect square is a number that can be written as some integer squared, like 1 (1\u00b2), 4 (2\u00b2), 9 (3\u00b2), 16 (4\u00b2), and so on. Similarly, a perfect cube is a number that's an integer cubed, such as 1 (1\u00b3), 8 (2\u00b3), 27 (3\u00b3), 64 (4\u00b3), etc.\n\nThe problem is asking for a number that's both a square and a cube. So, if a number is a square, it can be expressed as n\u00b2, and if it's a cube, as m\u00b3. To be both, there must be some integer k such that the number is k\u00b2 and also k\u00b3. Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Wait, if a number is both a square and a cube, then it's a sixth power. Because the least common multiple of 2 and 3 is 6. So, any number that's a sixth power would be both a square and a cube. For example, 1^6 = 1, 2^6 = 64, 3^6 = 729, etc.\n\nSo, the smallest number greater than 10 that is both a square and a cube would be 64, since 2^6 is 64. But let me check if there's any number between 10 and 64 that fits. Let's list the squares and cubes up to 64.\n\nSquares up to 64: 16 (4\u00b2), 25 (5\u00b2), 36 (6\u00b2), 49 (7\u00b2), 64 (8\u00b2).\n\nCubes up to 64: 8 (2\u00b3), 27 (3\u00b3), 64 (4\u00b3).\n\nLooking for overlaps between these lists. The squares are 16,25,36,49,64. The cubes are 8,27,64. The only common numbers here are 64. So 64 is the first one after 1 (which is 1^6) that's both. But wait, 1 is 1^6, but the problem says greater than 10, so 64 is next.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's another number I'm missing. Let me check numbers between 10 and 64. For example, 16 is a square but not a cube. 25 is square, not cube. 27 is cube but not square. 36 is square, not cube. 49 square, not cube. 64 is both. So yes, 64 is the first one after 1 that's both. Since the problem specifies greater than 10, 64 is the answer.\n\nBut let me confirm by another approach. If a number is both a square and a cube, then it must be a perfect sixth power. Because the exponents for the prime factors must be multiples of both 2 and 3, so LCM(2,3)=6. Therefore, the number is k^6 for some integer k. The first such number after 10 is 2^6=64. Because 1^6=1, which is less than 10. So 2^6=64 is the next one. Therefore, 64 is indeed the smallest such number greater than 10.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo find the smallest integer greater than 10 that is both a perfect square and a perfect cube, we need a number that satisfies two conditions:  \n1. It can be written as \\( n^2 \\) for some integer \\( n \\).  \n2. It can be written as \\( m^3 \\) for some integer \\( m \\).  \n\nA number that is both a perfect square and a perfect cube must be a **perfect sixth power**. This is because the exponents in its prime factorization must be multiples of both 2 (for squares) and 3 (for cubes). The least common multiple of 2 and 3 is 6, so the number must equal \\( k^6 \\) for some integer \\( k \\).  \n\nLet\u2019s check the smallest sixth powers:  \n- \\( 1^6 = 1 \\) (too small, as it is less than 10).  \n- \\( 2^6 = 64 \\).  \n\nNow, verify that 64 meets both conditions:  \n- **Perfect square**: \\( 8^2 = 64 \\).  \n- **Perfect cube**: \\( 4^3 = 64 \\).  \n\nTo confirm there are no numbers between 10 and 64 that satisfy both conditions, examine the squares and cubes in this range:  \n- **Squares**: 16 (\\(4^2\\)), 25 (\\(5^2\\)), 36 (\\(6^2\\)), 49 (\\(7^2\\)), 64 (\\(8^2\\)).  \n- **Cubes**: 8 (\\(2^3\\)), 27 (\\(3^3\\)), 64 (\\(4^3\\)).  \n\nThe only overlap is 64. Thus, 64 is the smallest integer greater than 10 that is both a perfect square and a perfect cube.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown constant 'Nat.le_of_pow_le_pow'\nunknown constant 'Nat.le_of_pow_le_pow'\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  t ^ 2\nn : \u2115\nh\u2080 : 10 \u2264 n\nx : \u2115\nhx : x ^ 2 = n\nt : \u2115\nht : t ^ 3 = n\nhx' : t ^ 2 = n\nht' : t ^ 3 = n\nh_le : x \u2264 t\nh_ge : t \u2264 x\nh_eq : x = t\n\u22a2 n = 64\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is to convert the base 9 number 852_9 to base 10 and show that it equals 695. Alright, so first, I need to remember how to convert a number from base 9 to base 10.\n\nBase conversion usually involves expanding each digit multiplied by the base raised to the power of its position, starting from 0 on the right. So for a number like abc in base n, it's a*n\u00b2 + b*n\u00b9 + c*n\u2070. Let me confirm that. Yes, that's right. Each digit is multiplied by the base to the power of its position index, starting from the rightmost digit as position 0.\n\nSo, applying that to 852_9. Let's break it down. The digits are 8, 5, and 2. The rightmost digit is 2, which is in the 9\u2070 position (which is 1). The middle digit 5 is in the 9\u00b9 position (which is 9), and the leftmost digit 8 is in the 9\u00b2 position (which is 81).\n\nCalculating each term:\n\nFirst digit (leftmost): 8 * 9\u00b2. Let's compute 9\u00b2 first. 9*9 is 81. So 8*81. 8*80 is 640, plus 8*1 is 8, so 640+8=648.\n\nSecond digit: 5 * 9\u00b9. 9\u00b9 is 9, so 5*9=45.\n\nThird digit: 2 * 9\u2070. 9\u2070 is 1, so 2*1=2.\n\nNow add all those together: 648 + 45 + 2. Let's add 648 and 45 first. 648 + 40 is 688, then +5 is 693. Then add 2: 693 + 2 = 695. So that should be 695 in base 10.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's verify each multiplication:\n\n8 * 81: 8*80=640, 8*1=8, total 648. Correct.\n\n5 * 9: 45. Correct.\n\n2 * 1: 2. Correct.\n\nAdding them up: 648 + 45. Let's do 648 + 40 = 688, then +5 = 693. Then 693 +2 = 695. Yep, that's right.\n\nSo the conversion is correct. Therefore, 852_9 equals 695 in base 10.\n\nI think that's all there is to it. The key steps are expanding each digit with the appropriate power of 9 and summing the results.

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the remainder when 54 is divided by 6, and show that it's 0. Let me start by recalling what modulo means. When we say a number is congruent to some remainder modulo n, like a \u2261 b mod m, it means that when you divide a by m, the remainder is b. So in this case, 54 mod 6 should give a remainder of 0.\n\nFirst, I should check if 54 is a multiple of 6. If it is, then dividing by 6 would leave no remainder. Let me think: 6 times 9 is 54. Yeah, 6*9=54. So that means 54 divided by 6 is exactly 9 with nothing left over. Therefore, the remainder is 0.\n\nWait, but maybe I should break it down more carefully. Let's do the division step by step. How many times does 6 go into 54? Well, 6*10 is 60, which is too big. So 6*9=54. That's exactly 54. So when you subtract 54 from 54, you get 0. So the remainder is definitely 0.\n\nAnother way to think about it is using the definition of congruence. If two numbers are congruent modulo m, their difference is a multiple of m. So 54 - 0 = 54, and since 54 is a multiple of 6 (as 6*9=54), then 54 \u2261 0 mod 6. That checks out.\n\nI also remember from the context example that when a number has a fractional part, like 1.6, you can separate the integer part and the fractional part. Then the fractional part is the remainder modulo 1. But here, we're dealing with integers and modulo 6. The principle is similar though: subtract multiples of the modulus until you get a number less than the modulus. Since 54 is exactly a multiple of 6, subtracting 6 nine times brings it down to 0, which is less than 6. Hence, the remainder is 0.\n\nSo putting it all together, since 54 is exactly divisible by 6 with no remainder, the remainder when 54 is divided by 6 is indeed 0.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo determine the remainder of 54 when divided by 6, we start by recognizing that division by 6 seeks to express 54 as a multiple of 6 plus a remainder less than 6. Specifically, we want integers \\( q \\) (the quotient) and \\( r \\) (the remainder) such that:\n\n\\[\n54 = 6 \\times q + r \\quad \\text{where} \\quad 0 \\leq r < 6.\n\\]\n\nObserve that \\( 6 \\times 9 = 54 \\). Substituting this into the equation gives:\n\n\\[\n54 = 6 \\times 9 + 0.\n\\]\n\nHere, the quotient \\( q = 9 \\), and the remainder \\( r = 0 \\). Since \\( 0 \\) satisfies \\( 0 \\leq 0 < 6 \\), it meets the criteria for a valid remainder. \n\nAdditionally, congruence modulo 6 requires that \\( 54 - 0 = 54 \\) is a multiple of 6. Because \\( 54 = 6 \\times 9 \\), this condition is satisfied. Thus, \\( 54 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{6} \\), confirming that the remainder is indeed \\( 0 \\).",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the remainder when the 100th Fibonacci number is divided by 4. The problem says to show that it's 3. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the Fibonacci sequence is defined by F\u2081 = 1, F\u2082 = 1, and each subsequent term is the sum of the two previous ones. So F\u2083 = 2, F\u2084 = 3, F\u2085 = 5, and so on. The question is about F\u2081\u2080\u2080 mod 4. Calculating F\u2081\u2080\u2080 directly would be impractical because it's a huge number. There must be a pattern or a cycle in the Fibonacci sequence modulo 4 that we can exploit.\n\nI recall that when dealing with Fibonacci numbers modulo some integer, the sequence eventually becomes periodic. This is known as the Pisano period. Maybe I can find the Pisano period for modulo 4 and use that to find F\u2081\u2080\u2080 mod 4 without computing all previous terms.\n\nLet me start by listing the Fibonacci numbers modulo 4 to see if I can spot a cycle. Let's compute the first few terms:\n\nF\u2081 = 1 \u2192 1 mod 4 = 1\nF\u2082 = 1 \u2192 1 mod 4 = 1\nF\u2083 = 2 \u2192 2 mod 4 = 2\nF\u2084 = 3 \u2192 3 mod 4 = 3\nF\u2085 = 5 \u2192 5 mod 4 = 1\nF\u2086 = 8 \u2192 8 mod 4 = 0\nF\u2087 = 13 \u2192 13 mod 4 = 1\nF\u2088 = 21 \u2192 21 mod 4 = 1\nF\u2089 = 34 \u2192 34 mod 4 = 2\nF\u2081\u2080 = 55 \u2192 55 mod 4 = 3\nF\u2081\u2081 = 89 \u2192 89 mod 4 = 1\nF\u2081\u2082 = 144 \u2192 144 mod 4 = 0\nF\u2081\u2083 = 233 \u2192 233 mod 4 = 1\nF\u2081\u2084 = 377 \u2192 377 mod 4 = 1\nF\u2081\u2085 = 610 \u2192 610 mod 4 = 2\nF\u2081\u2086 = 987 \u2192 987 mod 4 = 3\n\nLooking at the remainders: 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3...\n\nHmm, starting from F\u2081, the sequence of remainders modulo 4 is: 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 0, and then it seems to repeat. Let's check:\n\nAfter F\u2081\u2082 (remainder 0), F\u2081\u2083 is 1, F\u2081\u2084 is 1, F\u2081\u2085 is 2, F\u2081\u2086 is 3, which matches the start of the sequence. So the cycle here seems to be of length 6: 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 0, and then repeats. Wait, but from F\u2081 to F\u2086, the remainders are 1,1,2,3,1,0. Then F\u2087 is 1 again, which is the same as F\u2081. So the Pisano period for modulo 4 might be 6. Let me confirm:\n\nIf the period is 6, then F\u2087 mod 4 should be F\u2081 mod 4 = 1, which it is. F\u2088 mod 4 should be F\u2082 mod 4 = 1, which matches. F\u2089 mod 4 should be F\u2083 mod 4 = 2, which is correct. F\u2081\u2080 mod 4 = F\u2084 mod 4 = 3. F\u2081\u2081 mod 4 = F\u2085 mod 4 = 1. F\u2081\u2082 mod 4 = F\u2086 mod 4 = 0. Then F\u2081\u2083 mod 4 = F\u2087 mod 4 = 1, and so on. So yes, the cycle repeats every 6 terms.\n\nTherefore, the Pisano period modulo 4 is 6. That means that the remainder of F\u2099 modulo 4 repeats every 6 terms. So to find F\u2081\u2080\u2080 mod 4, I can find 100 modulo 6 to determine the position in the cycle.\n\nCalculating 100 divided by 6: 6*16=96, so 100 = 6*16 + 4. So the remainder is 4. That means F\u2081\u2080\u2080 mod 4 is the same as F\u2084 mod 4. From earlier, F\u2084 is 3, so F\u2084 mod 4 is 3. Therefore, the remainder should be 3.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The cycle is 1,1,2,3,1,0. So positions 1 to 6 correspond to remainders 1,1,2,3,1,0. Then position 7 is 1 again, which is position 1 in the cycle. So if 100 mod 6 is 4, then the 100th term corresponds to the 4th position in the cycle. The 4th position is 3. So yes, that matches. Therefore, the remainder is indeed 3.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the cycle length. Let's check a few more terms. F\u2081\u2087 would be F\u2081\u2086 + F\u2081\u2085 = 987 + 610 = 1597. 1597 mod 4: 1596 is divisible by 4 (since 1596 \u00f7 4 = 399), so 1597 mod 4 is 1. Then F\u2081\u2087 mod 4 is 1, which is the same as F\u2085 mod 4 (since 17 mod 6 is 5). F\u2085 mod 4 is 1. Correct. F\u2081\u2088 = F\u2081\u2087 + F\u2081\u2086 = 1597 + 987 = 2584. 2584 mod 4 is 0, which matches F\u2086 mod 4. So the cycle is indeed 6.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 3.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo determine the remainder when the 100th Fibonacci number \\( F_{100} \\) is divided by 4, we observe that Fibonacci sequences modulo \\( m \\) exhibit periodic behavior, known as the Pisano period. Here\u2019s how we proceed:\n\n1. **Compute the Pisano period for \\( m = 4 \\):**  \n   List the Fibonacci numbers modulo 4 until a repeating pattern emerges:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{align*}\n   F_1 &\\equiv 1 \\mod 4, \\\\\n   F_2 &\\equiv 1 \\mod 4, \\\\\n   F_3 &\\equiv 2 \\mod 4, \\\\\n   F_4 &\\equiv 3 \\mod 4, \\\\\n   F_5 &\\equiv 1 \\mod 4, \\\\\n   F_6 &\\equiv 0 \\mod 4, \\\\\n   F_7 &\\equiv 1 \\mod 4 \\quad (\\text{same as } F_1), \\\\\n   F_8 &\\equiv 1 \\mod 4 \\quad (\\text{same as } F_2), \\\\\n   &\\vdots\n   \\end{align*}\n   \\]\n   The sequence of remainders repeats every **6 terms**: \\( 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 0 \\).\n\n2. **Determine the position of \\( F_{100} \\) in the cycle:**  \n   Calculate \\( 100 \\mod 6 \\):\n   \\[\n   100 = 6 \\times 16 + 4 \\implies 100 \\equiv 4 \\mod 6.\n   \\]\n   This means \\( F_{100} \\equiv F_4 \\mod 4 \\).\n\n3. **Read the remainder from the cycle:**  \n   From the Pisano period, the 4th term in the cycle is \\( 3 \\).

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking how many positive integers n satisfy the equation (n + 1000)/70 = floor(sqrt(n)). The answer choices suggest it's 6, so I need to show that there are exactly six such integers.\n\nFirst, let's understand the equation. The left side is (n + 1000)/70, which is a linear function of n. The right side is the floor of the square root of n, which means it's the greatest integer less than or equal to sqrt(n). Let's denote floor(sqrt(n)) as k, where k is an integer. So, the equation becomes (n + 1000)/70 = k. Rearranging this equation, we can solve for n: n = 70k - 1000. But since n must be a positive integer, 70k - 1000 > 0, which implies k > 1000/70. Calculating that, 1000 divided by 70 is approximately 14.2857. So k must be at least 15 because k is an integer.\n\nNow, since k is the floor of sqrt(n), we know that k \u2264 sqrt(n) < k + 1. Squaring all parts of the inequality gives k\u00b2 \u2264 n < (k + 1)\u00b2. But we also have n = 70k - 1000 from the equation. Therefore, substituting n into the inequality, we get k\u00b2 \u2264 70k - 1000 < (k + 1)\u00b2. This gives us two inequalities to solve:\n\n1. k\u00b2 \u2264 70k - 1000\n2. 70k - 1000 < (k + 1)\u00b2\n\nLet's handle the first inequality: k\u00b2 - 70k + 1000 \u2264 0. Solving the quadratic equation k\u00b2 -70k +1000 =0, the discriminant is 70\u00b2 -4*1*1000 = 4900 -4000=900. The roots are (70 \u00b130)/2, which gives (70+30)/2=50 and (70-30)/2=20. So the quadratic is \u22640 between k=20 and k=50. But since k must be an integer \u226515, this inequality holds when k is between 20 and 50 inclusive.\n\nNow the second inequality: 70k -1000 < (k +1)\u00b2. Let's rearrange this: 70k -1000 < k\u00b2 + 2k +1. Bringing all terms to one side: -k\u00b2 +68k -1001 <0. Multiply both sides by -1 (which reverses the inequality): k\u00b2 -68k +1001 >0. Let's find the roots of k\u00b2 -68k +1001=0. The discriminant is 68\u00b2 -4*1*1001=4624 -4004=620. The roots are (68 \u00b1\u221a620)/2. \u221a620 is approximately 24.9, so the roots are approximately (68+24.9)/2\u224846.45 and (68-24.9)/2\u224821.55. So the quadratic is positive when k <21.55 or k>46.45. Since k is an integer, this inequality holds when k \u226421 or k\u226547.\n\nCombining the two inequalities:\n\nFrom the first inequality, k must be between 20 and 50 inclusive.\n\nFrom the second inequality, k must be \u226421 or \u226547.\n\nSo the overlap is k=20,21 (from 20-21) and k=47,48,49,50 (from 47-50). Wait, but the first inequality says k \u226520 and \u226450. The second inequality says k \u226421 or \u226547. So the valid k values are 20,21,47,48,49,50. That's six values.\n\nBut wait, earlier we determined that k must be at least 15. So 20,21,47,48,49,50 are all \u226515. Now, we need to check if each of these k values gives a valid n that satisfies the original equation and the floor condition.\n\nLet's check each k:\n\nFor k=20:\n\nn=70*20 -1000=1400-1000=400.\n\nCheck if floor(sqrt(400))=20. sqrt(400)=20, so floor(20)=20. Correct.\n\nFor k=21:\n\nn=70*21 -1000=1470-1000=470.\n\nsqrt(470) is approximately 21.67, so floor is 21. Correct.\n\nFor k=47:\n\nn=70*47 -1000=3290-1000=2290.\n\nsqrt(2290) is approx 47.85, floor is 47. Correct.\n\nk=48:\n\nn=70*48 -1000=3360-1000=2360.\n\nsqrt(2360)\u224848.57, floor is 48. Correct.\n\nk=49:\n\nn=70*49 -1000=3430-1000=2430.\n\nsqrt(2430)\u224849.3, floor is 49. Correct.\n\nk=50:\n\nn=70*50 -1000=3500-1000=2500.\n\nsqrt(2500)=50, floor is 50. Correct.\n\nSo all six k values (20,21,47,48,49,50) produce valid n. Therefore, there are 6 positive integers n that satisfy the equation. The answer is C)6.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo determine how many positive integers \\( n \\) satisfy \\(\\frac{n + 1000}{70} = \\lfloor \\sqrt{n} \\rfloor\\), let\u2019s denote \\( k = \\lfloor \\sqrt{n} \\rfloor \\), where \\( k \\) is an integer. This transforms the equation into \\( n = 70k - 1000 \\). Since \\( n \\) must be positive, \\( 70k - 1000 > 0 \\), so \\( k > \\frac{1000}{70} \\approx 14.285 \\), meaning \\( k \\geq 15 \\).\n\nNext, the floor function implies \\( k \\leq \\sqrt{n} < k + 1 \\). Squaring these inequalities gives \\( k^2 \\leq n < (k + 1)^2 \\). Substituting \\( n = 70k - 1000 \\), we derive two inequalities:\n\n1. **Lower bound**: \\( k^2 \\leq 70k - 1000 \\).  \n   Rearranging: \\( k^2 - 70k + 1000 \\leq 0 \\).  \n   Solving \\( k^2 - 70k + 1000 = 0 \\), the roots are \\( k = 20 \\) and \\( k = 50 \\).  \n   Thus, \\( 20 \\leq k \\leq 50 \\).\n\n2. **Upper bound**: \\( 70k - 1000 < (k + 1)^2 \\).  \n   Rearranging: \\( k^2 - 68k + 1001 > 0 \\).  \n   Solving \\( k^2 - 68k + 1001 = 0 \\), the roots are approximately \\( k \\approx 21.55 \\) and \\( k \\approx 46.45 \\).  \n   Thus, \\( k < 21.55 \\) or \\( k > 46.45 \\).\n\nCombining these results, valid \\( k \\)-values lie in the overlap of \\( 20 \\leq k \\leq 50 \\) and \\( k \\leq 21 \\) or \\( k \\geq 47 \\). This gives \\( k = 20, 21, 47, 48, 49, 50 \\).\n\nFor each \\( k \\):\n- \\( k = 20 \\): \\( n = 70(20) - 1000 = 400 \\), and \\( \\lfloor \\sqrt{400} \\rfloor = 20 \\).\n- \\( k = 21 \\): \\( n = 470 \\), \\( \\lfloor \\sqrt{470} \\rfloor = 21 \\).\n- \\( k = 47 \\): \\( n = 2290 \\), \\( \\lfloor \\sqrt{2290} \\rfloor = 47 \\).\n- \\( k = 48 \\): \\( n = 2360 \\), \\( \\lfloor \\sqrt{2360} \\rfloor = 48 \\).\n- \\( k = 49 \\): \\( n = 2430 \\), \\( \\lfloor \\sqrt{2430} \\rfloor = 49 \\).\n- \\( k = 50 \\): \\( n = 2500 \\), \\( \\lfloor \\sqrt{2500} \\rfloor = 50 \\).\n\nAll six values satisfy the original equation. Hence, there are **6** such integers \\( n \\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown constant 'Nat.cast_mod'\nunknown constant 'Nat.cast_sup'\nunknown constant 'Nat.cast_inf'\ntactic 'contradiction' failed\nS : Finset \u2115\nh\u2080 : \u2200 (n : \u2115), n \u2208 S \u2194 0 < n \u2227 (\u2191n + 1000) / 70 = \u2191\u230a\u221a\u2191n\u230b\nn x\u271d : \u2115\nhn : 0 < x\u271d \u2227 (\u2191x\u271d + 1000) / 70 = \u2191\u230a\u221a\u2191x\u271d\u230b\n\u22a2 x\u271d = 400 \u2228 x\u271d = 470 \u2228 x\u271d = 2290 \u2228 x\u271d = 2360 \u2228 x\u271d = 2430 \u2228 x\u271d = 2500\nunsolved goals\nS : Finset \u2115\nh\u2080 : \u2200 (n : \u2115), n \u2208 S \u2194 0 < n \u2227 (\u2191n + 1000) / 70 = \u2191\u230a\u221a\u2191n\u230b\nn : \u2115\nhn : 400 = 400 \u2228 400 = 470 \u2228 400 = 2290 \u2228 400 = 2360 \u2228 400 = 2430 \u2228 400 = 2500\n\u22a2 (400 + 1000) / 70 = \u2191\u230a\u221a400\u230b\nunsolved goals\nS : Finset \u2115\nh\u2080 : \u2200 (n : \u2115), n \u2208 S \u2194 0 < n \u2227 (\u2191n + 1000) / 70 = \u2191\u230a\u221a\u2191n\u230b\nn : \u2115\nhn : 470 = 400 \u2228 470 = 470 \u2228 470 = 2290 \u2228 470 = 2360 \u2228 470 = 2430 \u2228 470 = 2500\n\u22a2 (470 + 1000) / 70 = \u2191\u230a\u221a470\u230b\nunsolved goals\nS : Finset \u2115\nh\u2080 : \u2200 (n : \u2115), n \u2208 S \u2194 0 < n \u2227 (\u2191n + 1000) / 70 = \u2191\u230a\u221a\u2191n\u230b\nn : \u2115\nhn : 2290 = 400 \u2228 2290 = 470 \u2228 2290 = 2290 \u2228 2290 = 2360 \u2228 2290 = 2430 \u2228 2290 = 2500\n\u22a2 (2290 + 1000) / 70 = \u2191\u230a\u221a2290\u230b\nunsolved goals\nS : Finset \u2115\nh\u2080 : \u2200 (n : \u2115), n \u2208 S \u2194 0 < n \u2227 (\u2191n + 1000) / 70 = \u2191\u230a\u221a\u2191n\u230b\nn : \u2115\nhn : 2360 = 400 \u2228 2360 = 470 \u2228 2360 = 2290 \u2228 2360 = 2360 \u2228 2360 = 2430 \u2228 2360 = 2500\n\u22a2 (2360 + 1000) / 70 = \u2191\u230a\u221a2360\u230b\nunsolved goals\nS : Finset \u2115\nh\u2080 : \u2200 (n : \u2115), n \u2208 S \u2194 0 < n \u2227 (\u2191n + 1000) / 70 = \u2191\u230a\u221a\u2191n\u230b\nn : \u2115\nhn : 2430 = 400 \u2228 2430 = 470 \u2228 2430 = 2290 \u2228 2430 = 2360 \u2228 2430 = 2430 \u2228 2430 = 2500\n\u22a2 (2430 + 1000) / 70 = \u2191\u230a\u221a2430\u230b\nunsolved goals\nS : Finset \u2115\nh\u2080 : \u2200 (n : \u2115), n \u2208 S \u2194 0 < n \u2227 (\u2191n + 1000) / 70 = \u2191\u230a\u221a\u2191n\u230b\nn : \u2115\nhn : 2500 = 400 \u2228 2500 = 470 \u2228 2500 = 2290 \u2228 2500 = 2360 \u2228 2500 = 2430 \u2228 2500 = 2500\n\u22a2 (2500 + 1000) / 70 = \u2191\u230a\u221a2500\u230b\ntactic 'contradiction' failed\nS : Finset \u2115\nh\u2080 : \u2200 (n : \u2115), n \u2208 S \u2194 0 < n \u2227 (\u2191n + 1000) / 70 = \u2191\u230a\u221a\u2191n\u230b\nn x\u271d : \u2115\nhn : x\u271d = 400 \u2228 x\u271d = 470 \u2228 x\u271d = 2290 \u2228 x\u271d = 2360 \u2228 x\u271d = 2430 \u2228 x\u271d = 2500\n\u22a2 0 < x\u271d \u2227 (\u2191x\u271d + 1000) / 70 = \u2191\u230a\u221a\u2191x\u271d\u230b\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. We need to find the sum of the digits A, M, and C where the two 5-digit numbers AMC10 and AMC12 add up to 123422. The answer choices suggest that the sum is between 10 and 14, with the correct answer being 14. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's write the addition problem vertically to visualize the digits:\n\n   A M C 1 0\n+  A M C 1 2\n-----------\n1 2 3 4 2 2\n\nSince both numbers are 5-digit numbers starting with AMC, their sum is a 6-digit number starting with 1. This tells us that when adding the two 5-digit numbers, there's a carryover into a new digit place, making the total 123422. So the first digit of the sum is 1, which comes from the carryover when adding the two A's. Therefore, A must be such that A + A (plus any possible carryover from the previous digit) equals 12 (since the second digit of the sum is 2). Wait, let's check each digit position carefully.\n\nLet's analyze each column from right to left, considering possible carryovers:\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\n0 (from AMC10) + 2 (from AMC12) = 2. The units digit of the sum is 2, which matches. So no carryover here.\n\nNext, the tens place:\n\n1 (from AMC10) + 1 (from AMC12) = 2. The tens digit of the sum is 2. Again, this matches. No carryover here either.\n\nMoving to the hundreds place:\n\nC (from both numbers) + C (since both numbers have C in the hundreds place) plus any carryover from the tens place. But since there was no carryover from the tens place (since 1+1=2 exactly), it's C + C. The hundreds digit of the sum is 4. So 2C must end with 4. Therefore, 2C \u2261 4 mod 10. Solving this, C could be 2 or 7 (since 2*2=4 and 2*7=14, which ends with 4). However, if C is 7, then there would be a carryover of 1 to the next digit. Let's note both possibilities.\n\nNext, the thousands place:\n\nM (from both numbers) + M plus any carryover from the hundreds place. The thousands digit of the sum is 3. Let's denote the carryover from the hundreds place as k (which is 0 or 1). So 2M + k = 3 or 13 (since the thousands digit is 3, but if there's a carryover here, it would affect the next digit). However, since the next digit (ten-thousands place) in the sum is 4, we need to consider how the carryover here affects that. Let's hold that thought for a moment.\n\nFinally, the ten-thousands place:\n\nA (from both numbers) + A plus any carryover from the thousands place. The ten-thousands digit of the sum is 4. So 2A + carryover from thousands place = 4 or 14 (if there's a carryover from the ten-thousands place to the hundred-thousands place). But since the total sum is 123422, the hundred-thousands digit is 1, which comes from the carryover when adding the two A's. Therefore, 2A + carryover from thousands place must be 12 (since 12 is the number that would give a carryover of 1 to make the hundred-thousands digit 1, and the ten-thousands digit 2). Wait, but the ten-thousands digit in the sum is 4. Wait, maybe I need to re-examine the positions.\n\nWait, let's clarify the positions. The numbers AMC10 and AMC12 are 5-digit numbers. Let's write their positions:\n\nAMC10: A (ten-thousands), M (thousands), C (hundreds), 1 (tens), 0 (units)\nAMC12: A (ten-thousands), M (thousands), C (hundreds), 1 (tens), 2 (units)\n\nWhen added together, the sum is 123422, which is a 6-digit number. The positions in the sum are:\n\n1 (hundred-thousands), 2 (ten-thousands), 3 (thousands), 4 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 2 (units)\n\nSo adding the two 5-digit numbers:\n\n      A M C 1 0\n+     A M C 1 2\n-----------------\n1 2 3 4 2 2\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit (units):\n\n0 + 2 = 2 (units place of sum is 2, correct)\nTens place: 1 + 1 = 2 (tens place of sum is 2, correct)\nHundreds place: C + C = 4 (with possible carryover)\nThousands place: M + M + carryover from hundreds = 3 (with possible carryover)\nTen-thousands place: A + A + carryover from thousands = 2 (but the sum's ten-thousands digit is 2, and there's a carryover into hundred-thousands place making it 1)\n\nWait, this seems conflicting. Let's correct the digit positions:\n\nThe sum's digits are:\n\nPosition 6 (hundred-thousands): 1\nPosition 5 (ten-thousands): 2\nPosition 4 (thousands): 3\nPosition 3 (hundreds): 4\nPosition 2 (tens): 2\nPosition 1 (units): 2\n\nBut when adding the two numbers:\n\nThe rightmost digit (units) is position 1: 0 + 2 = 2 (matches sum's position 1)\nTens (position 2): 1 + 1 = 2 (matches sum's position 2)\nHundreds (position 3): C + C = 4 (sum's position 3 is 4)\nThousands (position 4): M + M + carryover from hundreds = sum's position 4 is 3\nTen-thousands (position 5): A + A + carryover from thousands = sum's position 5 is 2\nHundred-thousands (position 6): carryover from ten-thousands place, which is 1.\n\nSo breaking it down:\n\n1. Units place: 0 + 2 = 2, no carryover.\n2. Tens place: 1 + 1 = 2, no carryover.\n3. Hundreds place: C + C = 4 or 14 (if there's a carryover, but since there's no carryover from tens, it's just 2C. So 2C must be 4 or 14. Therefore, C=2 or 7. If C=7, then 2*7=14, which would give a carryover of 1 to the thousands place. If C=2, then 2*2=4, no carryover.\n4. Thousands place: M + M + carryover (0 or 1) = 3 or 13 (since the sum's thousands digit is 3). Let's consider both possibilities.\n\nCase 1: C=2 (no carryover)\nThen 2M = 3 or 13. But 3 is odd, and 2M is even, so 2M=13 is impossible. 2M=3 is also impossible because M is an integer digit. Therefore, this case is invalid. So C must be 7 with a carryover of 1.\n\nCase 2: C=7 (carryover 1 to thousands place)\nThen 2M + 1 = 3 or 13. Let's check:\n\nIf 2M +1 = 3 \u2192 2M=2 \u2192 M=1\nIf 2M +1 =13 \u2192 2M=12 \u2192 M=6\n\nNow, moving to the ten-thousands place:\n\nA + A + carryover from thousands place = 2 or 12 (since the sum's ten-thousands digit is 2, and there's a carryover to the hundred-thousands place which is 1). Let's see:\n\nThe carryover from thousands place depends on the value of 2M +1. If M=1, then 2*1 +1=3, which is less than 10, so no carryover. If M=6, then 2*6 +1=13, which would carryover 1 to the ten-thousands place.\n\nSo two subcases:\n\nSubcase 1: M=1, carryover from thousands=0\nThen 2A +0 = 2 \u2192 A=1. But then the ten-thousands digits would be 1+1=2, which matches the sum's ten-thousands digit 2. However, the hundred-thousands digit is 1, which comes from a carryover. But if there's no carryover from the ten-thousands place (since 2A=2, no carryover), then how does the hundred-thousands digit become 1? This is a contradiction. Therefore, this subcase is invalid.\n\nSubcase 2: M=6, carryover from thousands=1\nThen 2A +1 = 12 (since we need a carryover to make the hundred-thousands digit 1). Because 2A +1 must be 12 (since 12 would give a digit of 2 in the ten-thousands place and a carryover of 1 to the hundred-thousands place). Solving 2A +1 =12 \u2192 2A=11 \u2192 A=5.5, which is not possible since A must be an integer digit. Wait, that's a problem. Alternatively, maybe 2A +1 = 2 with a carryover of 1? Wait, no. Let's clarify.\n\nWait, the ten-thousands place in the sum is 2. The ten-thousands place comes from A + A + carryover from thousands (which is 1 in this subcase). So:\n\n2A +1 (carryover) = 2 + 10*k, where k is the carryover to the hundred-thousands place. Since the hundred-thousands digit is 1, k must be 1. Therefore:\n\n2A +1 = 12 \u2192 2A=11 \u2192 A=5.5, which is impossible. Therefore, this subcase also leads to a contradiction.\n\nWait, this can't be right. Did I make a mistake here?\n\nLet me re-examine the ten-thousands place. The sum's ten-thousands digit is 2, and the hundred-thousands digit is 1. So when adding the two A's (each in the ten-thousands place) plus any carryover from the thousands place, the total must be 12 (since 12 would give a digit of 2 in the ten-thousands place and a carryover of 1 to the hundred-thousands place). Therefore:\n\n2A + carryover_from_thousands = 12\n\nIn Subcase 2, carryover_from_thousands is 1 (because M=6 leads to 2*6 +1=13, so carryover 1). Therefore:\n\n2A +1 =12 \u2192 2A=11 \u2192 A=5.5, which is invalid. So this suggests that neither M=1 nor M=6 works. But we already determined that C=7 is necessary. Did I make a mistake in the earlier steps?\n\nWait, let's go back. When C=7, 2*7=14, so hundreds place sum is 4 with a carryover of 1 to the thousands place. Then in the thousands place: 2M +1 =3 or 13. If 2M +1=3 \u2192 M=1, but then ten-thousands place gives A=1, which conflicts with the carryover. If 2M +1=13 \u2192 M=6, which leads to 2A +1=12 \u2192 A=5.5, which is invalid. So both possibilities for M lead to contradictions. That can't be right. Where's the mistake?\n\nWait, maybe the thousands place sum is 3, but with a carryover. Wait, the thousands digit in the sum is 3. So when adding M + M + carryover_from_hundreds (which is 1), we get a number that ends with 3 in the thousands place. So 2M +1 = 3 + 10*k, where k is the carryover to the ten-thousands place. Since the ten-thousands place sum is 2, and there's a carryover to the hundred-thousands place, we need to consider k.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to adjust the approach. Let's denote:\n\nIn the thousands place: 2M +1 = 3 + 10*k1, where k1 is the carryover to the ten-thousands place (k1 can be 0 or 1, since 2M +1 is at most 2*9 +1=19, so k1 can be 0 or 1).\n\nSimilarly, in the ten-thousands place: 2A + k1 = 2 + 10*k2, where k2 is the carryover to the hundred-thousands place. Since the hundred-thousands digit is 1, k2 must be 1. Therefore:\n\n2A + k1 = 12 (since 2 + 10*1=12)\n\nSo now, let's consider possible k1 values (0 or 1):\n\nCase 1: k1=0 \u2192 2A =12 \u2192 A=6. Then in the thousands place: 2M +1 =3 +0 \u2192 2M +1=3 \u2192 M=1. But then A=6 and M=1. Let's check if this works.\n\nBut wait, if A=6, then the two numbers are 6 M C 1 0 and 6 M C 1 2. Their sum would start with 6+6=12, which would make the hundred-thousands digit 1 and the ten-thousands digit 2, which matches the sum's 1 2 3 4 2 2. Then the thousands place would be M + M + carryover_from_hundreds (which is 1). If M=1, then 1+1+1=3, which matches the thousands digit 3. Then hundreds place: C=7, so 7+7=14, which gives 4 with carryover 1. Tens and units are correct. Then the digits would be A=6, M=1, C=7. Then A+M+C=6+1+7=14, which is option E. But wait, this seems to work. Did I make a mistake earlier?\n\nWait, let's reconstruct with A=6, M=1, C=7:\n\nAMC10 = 6 1 7 1 0 \u2192 61710\nAMC12 = 6 1 7 1 2 \u2192 61712\nSum: 61710 + 61712 = 123422, which matches. So A=6, M=1, C=7. Then A+M+C=14. But according to the earlier steps, when k1=0, A=6, M=1. But earlier when I considered M=1, I thought there was a contradiction because I thought A would have to be 1. But no, in this case, A=6, which is allowed. So where did I go wrong before?\n\nAh, I see the mistake. Earlier, when I considered M=1, I incorrectly assumed that A would have to be 1, but that's not the case. Let's re-examine the ten-thousands place with k1=0:\n\nIf k1=0 (no carryover from thousands to ten-thousands), then 2A +0 =12 \u2192 A=6. Then in the thousands place: 2M +1 =3 (since k1=0 implies no carryover, so 2M +1=3). Therefore, M=1. This works because:\n\nA=6, M=1, C=7.\n\nAdding the two numbers:\n\n61710 +61712 = 123422, which is correct. Therefore, the solution is A=6, M=1, C=7, sum 14.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that the answer is E)14, which matches. So why did I get confused earlier? Because I incorrectly thought that when M=1, A would have to be 1, but that's not the case. The key was realizing that the carryover from the thousands place (k1) can be 0, allowing A=6. This resolves the contradiction.\n\nTherefore, the correct values are A=6, M=1, C=7, and their sum is 14.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nLet's analyze the addition of the two 5-digit numbers AMC10 and AMC12 to get 123422. We'll break down the problem digit by digit, considering possible carryovers:\n\n1. **Units Place**:  \n   \\(0 + 2 = 2\\) (matches the sum's units digit 2). No carryover.\n\n2. **Tens Place**:  \n   \\(1 + 1 = 2\\) (matches the sum's tens digit 2). No carryover.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place**:  \n   \\(C + C\\) must equal 4 (the sum's hundreds digit).  \n   - If \\(2C = 4\\), then \\(C = 2\\).  \n   - If \\(2C = 14\\) (with a carryover of 1), then \\(C = 7\\).  \n   Testing \\(C = 2\\) leads to contradictions in later steps, so \\(C = 7\\) is forced, with a carryover of 1 to the thousands place.\n\n4. **Thousands Place**:  \n   \\(M + M + 1\\) (carryover) must equal 3 (the sum's thousands digit).  \n   - \\(2M + 1 = 3\\) \u2192 \\(M = 1\\).  \n   - \\(2M + 1 = 13\\) (with a carryover of 1) \u2192 \\(M = 6\\).  \n   Testing \\(M = 6\\) leads to contradictions, so \\(M = 1\\) is forced, with no carryover to the ten-thousands place.\n\n5. **Ten-Thousands Place**:  \n   \\(A + A\\) must equal 12 (since the sum's ten-thousands digit is 2, and there's a carryover of 1 to the hundred-thousands place).  \n   - \\(2A = 12\\) \u2192 \\(A = 6\\).\n\n6. **Verification**:  \n   Substituting \\(A = 6\\), \\(M = 1\\), \\(C = 7\\):  \n   \\(AMC10 = 61710\\) and \\(AMC12 = 61712\\).  \n   Their sum",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, we need to find the smallest possible least common multiple (LCM) of two positive integers a and b. The conditions are that a ends with 2, b ends with 4, and their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 6. And we need to show that the smallest LCM is 108.\n\nFirst, I remember that LCM(a, b) multiplied by GCD(a, b) equals the product of a and b. So, LCM(a, b) = (a \u00d7 b) / GCD(a, b). Since the GCD is given as 6, the LCM would be (a \u00d7 b)/6. Therefore, to minimize the LCM, we need to minimize the product a \u00d7 b, given the constraints on their units digits and GCD.\n\nNow, since the GCD of a and b is 6, both a and b must be multiples of 6. But wait, their units digits are 2 and 4 respectively. Let me think. If a ends with 2 and is a multiple of 6, then a must be divisible by both 2 and 3. Similarly, b ends with 4 and is a multiple of 6, so it must also be divisible by 2 and 3. Let's check that.\n\nFor a to end with 2 and be divisible by 6: The units digit 2 is even, so divisible by 2. To be divisible by 3, the sum of its digits must be a multiple of 3. Similarly for b ending with 4: even, so divisible by 2, and sum of digits must be multiple of 3 for divisibility by 3.\n\nBut since GCD(a, b) is exactly 6, they can't have any higher common factors. So, if we factor a and b as 6 times some integers, say a = 6m and b = 6n, then m and n must be coprime (their GCD is 1). Because if m and n had a common divisor greater than 1, then the GCD of a and b would be 6 times that divisor, which would be more than 6. So m and n must be coprime.\n\nTherefore, LCM(a, b) = (a \u00d7 b)/GCD(a, b) = (6m \u00d7 6n)/6 = 6mn. So to minimize LCM(a, b), we need to minimize mn, since 6 is fixed. So the problem reduces to finding the smallest possible mn where m and n are coprime positive integers, and a = 6m ends with 2, and b = 6n ends with 4.\n\nLet's find possible m and n. Since a = 6m ends with 2, 6m \u2261 2 mod 10. Let's solve for m. 6m \u2261 2 mod 10. Dividing both sides by 2: 3m \u2261 1 mod 5. So 3m \u2261 1 mod 5. The multiplicative inverse of 3 mod 5 is 2 because 3\u00d72=6\u22611 mod5. Therefore, m \u2261 2 mod5. So m can be 2,7,12,17,... Similarly, for b =6n ending with 4: 6n \u22614 mod10. Divide both sides by 2: 3n \u22612 mod5. Multiply both sides by inverse of 3 mod5, which is 2 again: n \u22612\u00d72=4 mod5. So n \u22614 mod5. So n can be 4,9,14,19,...\n\nBut m and n must be coprime. So we need to find the smallest m and n in these sequences such that gcd(m,n)=1.\n\nLet's list possible m and n:\n\nPossible m (starting from smallest): 2,7,12,17,22,...\n\nPossible n:4,9,14,19,24,...\n\nWe need to pair m and n from these sequences with gcd(m,n)=1.\n\nStart with the smallest m=2. Let's check possible n:\n\nn=4: gcd(2,4)=2\u22601. Not coprime.\n\nn=9: gcd(2,9)=1. Good. So pair (2,9). Then mn=2\u00d79=18. So LCM would be 6\u00d718=108.\n\nWait, but let's check if a=6\u00d72=12 (ends with 2) and b=6\u00d79=54 (ends with 4). GCD(12,54). Wait, 12 and 54: GCD is 6, which matches. So LCM would be (12\u00d754)/6 = (648)/6=108. That works. But is there a smaller pair?\n\nWait, maybe m=7 and n=4. Let's check. m=7 (from the sequence 2,7,12...). n=4. Then a=6\u00d77=42 (ends with 2), b=6\u00d74=24 (ends with 4). GCD(42,24). Let's compute GCD(42,24). 42 \u00f724=1 rem18; 24\u00f718=1 rem6; 18\u00f76=3 rem0. So GCD is 6. Correct. Then LCM would be (42\u00d724)/6 = (1008)/6=168. Which is larger than 108. So 108 is smaller.\n\nAnother pair: m=2 and n=9 gives 108. Next possible m=2 and n=14: gcd(2,14)=2\u22601. Not coprime. m=2 and n=19: gcd(2,19)=1. Then mn=2\u00d719=38, LCM=6\u00d738=228. That's bigger. So 108 is better.\n\nNext, m=7 and n=9: gcd(7,9)=1. mn=63, LCM=6\u00d763=378. Larger.\n\nm=7 and n=4: as before, 168.\n\nm=12 and n=4: gcd(12,4)=4\u22601. Not allowed.\n\nm=12 and n=9: gcd(12,9)=3\u22601. Not coprime.\n\nm=12 and n=14: gcd(12,14)=2\u22601.\n\nSo the smallest mn is 2\u00d79=18, leading to LCM 108. Therefore, the minimal LCM is 108.\n\nBut wait, let's check if there's a smaller m and n. For example, m=2 and n=9 gives a=12 and b=54. But maybe there's a smaller a and b that meet the conditions. Let's see: a must end with 2 and be a multiple of 6. The smallest such numbers are 12, 42, 72, etc. Similarly, b must end with 4 and be a multiple of 6: 24, 54, 84, etc.\n\nCheck a=12 and b=24: GCD(12,24)=12, which is higher than 6. So that's invalid.\n\na=12 and b=54: GCD is 6. Correct.\n\na=42 and b=24: GCD(42,24)=6. LCM would be (42\u00d724)/6=168. Which is higher than 108.\n\na=12 and b=54 gives LCM 108. So that's the minimal one.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible LCM is indeed 108.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo find the smallest possible least common multiple (LCM) of two positive integers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) where:\n- The units digit of \\(a\\) is \\(2\\),\n- The units digit of \\(b\\) is \\(4\\),\n- \\(\\gcd(a, b) = 6\\),\n\nwe use the relationship between the greatest common divisor (GCD) and LCM:  \n\\[\n\\text{LCM}(a, b) = \\frac{a \\times b}{\\gcd(a, b)}.\n\\]\nSince \\(\\gcd(a, b) = 6\\), this simplifies to \\(\\text{LCM}(a, b) = \\frac{a \\times b}{6}\\).

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a square that's originally 3491 units on each side. The problem says we decrease its length by 60 and increase its width by 60. Then we need to find out how much the area changes and show that the change is 3600.\n\nFirst, let me visualize this. Originally, it's a square, so length and width are both 3491. When they change the dimensions, the new length becomes 3491 - 60, and the new width becomes 3491 + 60. The area change would be the new area minus the original area.\n\nWait, but the original area is 3491 squared. The new area is (3491 - 60) multiplied by (3491 + 60). Hmm, that looks like a difference of squares. Remember, (a - b)(a + b) = a\u00b2 - b\u00b2. So maybe that's the key here.\n\nLet me write that down. Original area: A\u2081 = 3491\u00b2. New area: A\u2082 = (3491 - 60)(3491 + 60). Using the difference of squares formula, that simplifies to 3491\u00b2 - 60\u00b2. So the change in area is A\u2082 - A\u2081 = (3491\u00b2 - 60\u00b2) - 3491\u00b2 = -60\u00b2 = -3600. But wait, the problem says to show that the area change is 3600. The negative sign indicates a decrease, but the magnitude is 3600. So maybe the question is asking for the absolute value of the change, which would be 3600. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is phrased such that the area decreases by 3600. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem states: \"By how much does its area change? Show that it is 3600.\" So regardless of whether it's an increase or decrease, the magnitude is 3600. But according to the calculation, the new area is less than the original by 3600. Because when you subtract 60\u00b2, which is 3600, from the original area squared. So the area decreases by 3600. Therefore, the answer is a decrease of 3600, hence the change is -3600, but the problem might just want the absolute value. However, the problem says \"Show that it is 3600,\" so maybe they just care about the magnitude. But let's confirm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in my reasoning. Let me go through it again. Original area: 3491 * 3491. New dimensions: (3491 - 60) and (3491 + 60). Multiplying those gives 3491\u00b2 - 60\u00b2. So the new area is 3491\u00b2 - 3600. Therefore, the original area is 3491\u00b2, so the difference is (3491\u00b2 - 3600) - 3491\u00b2 = -3600. So the area decreases by 3600. Therefore, the change is -3600, but the problem states to show it's 3600. Maybe the question is phrased as \"by how much\" without considering direction, so the answer is 3600. That makes sense. So the area changes by 3600 (a decrease), so the answer is 3600.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should present it as the absolute difference. Either way, the key is that the difference is 3600. The use of the difference of squares here is crucial. Let me make sure there's no arithmetic error. 60 squared is indeed 3600. So the calculation seems correct. Therefore, the area changes by 3600, which is exactly what we needed to show.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nLet's start by analyzing the original and modified dimensions of the square. The original square has sides of length \\(3491\\), so its area is \\(3491 \\times 3491 = 3491^2\\). \n\nWhen the length is decreased by \\(60\\), it becomes \\(3491 - 60\\), and when the width is increased by \\(60\\), it becomes \\(3491 + 60\\). The new area is therefore \\((3491 - 60) \\times (3491 + 60)\\). \n\nNotice that this expression fits the pattern of a **difference of squares**:  \n\\[\n(a - b)(a + b) = a^2 - b^2.\n\\]\nApplying this formula, the new area simplifies to:\n\\[\n3491^2 - 60^2.\n\\]\n\nTo find the change in area, subtract the original area (\\(3491^2\\)) from the new area (\\(3491^2 - 60^2\\)):\n\\[\n\\text{Change} = (3491^2 - 60^2) - 3491^2 = -60^2 = -3600.\n\\]\nThe negative sign indicates a **decrease** in area. However, the problem asks for the magnitude of the change, which is \\(3600\\). \n\nThus, the area decreases by \\(3600\\) square units.

We need to show that for positive real numbers a, b, c with ab + bc + ca \u2265 3, the inequality 3/\u221a2 \u2264 a/\u221a(a+b) + b/\u221a(b+c) + c/\u221a(c+a) holds. Hmm, first, I should recall some inequalities that might be useful here. The problem involves sums of fractions with square roots in the denominators, so maybe Cauchy-Schwarz or H\u00f6lder's inequality could come into play. Let me think.\n\nLooking at the denominators, each term has a square root of a sum of two variables. The numerators are each variable. So, for example, the first term is a divided by \u221a(a+b). Maybe I can relate this to some kind of weighted average or use substitution to simplify the expression.\n\nWait, the condition given is ab + bc + ca \u2265 3. That's a symmetric condition in a, b, c. The inequality we need to prove is also symmetric, so perhaps assuming symmetry in variables might help. Maybe even setting a = b = c could be a test case. Let me check that.\n\nIf a = b = c, then ab + bc + ca = 3a\u00b2 \u2265 3, so a\u00b2 \u2265 1, which means a \u2265 1. Then the right-hand side of the inequality becomes 3 * a / \u221a(2a) = 3a / \u221a(2a) = 3\u221aa / \u221a2. Since a \u2265 1, this would be at least 3/\u221a2, which matches the inequality's right-hand side. So equality holds when a = b = c = 1. That's a good check. But how to generalize this to all positive a, b, c with ab + bc + ca \u2265 3?\n\nMaybe using Cauchy-Schwarz. Let's recall that Cauchy-Schwarz says that (\u03a3x_i y_i)^2 \u2264 (\u03a3x_i\u00b2)(\u03a3y_i\u00b2). Alternatively, in the form \u03a3 (x_i^2) \u2265 (\u03a3x_i)^2 / n. But how to apply it here.\n\nAlternatively, H\u00f6lder's inequality: For sequences (a_i), (b_i), (c_i), H\u00f6lder can relate sums of products. But maybe that's more complicated. Let's think about each term a/\u221a(a+b). Let me denote each term as a / sqrt(a + b). Let's consider squaring the entire sum to apply Cauchy-Schwarz. Let me see:\n\nLet S = a/\u221a(a+b) + b/\u221a(b+c) + c/\u221a(c+a). Then, by Cauchy-Schwarz, (S)^2 \u2264 (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) * [1/(a+b) + 1/(b+c) + 1/(c+a)]. But wait, that would give an upper bound on S\u00b2, but we need a lower bound on S. So maybe this approach isn't directly helpful. Alternatively, maybe reverse Cauchy-Schwarz? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the AM-GM inequality. But AM-GM usually gives upper or lower bounds on products. Let's see. The denominators are sqrt(a+b), which is similar to sqrt(a + b). If we can relate sqrt(a + b) to something involving ab + bc + ca, but not sure.\n\nWait, the given condition is ab + bc + ca \u2265 3. Maybe we can normalize the variables. Let's suppose that ab + bc + ca = 3, since if it's larger, maybe the inequality becomes easier? Wait, but increasing ab + bc + ca might not directly affect the terms a/\u221a(a+b) etc. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps use Lagrange multipliers to find the minimum of S under the constraint ab + bc + ca \u2265 3. But that's complicated.\n\nAlternatively, consider substituting variables. Let me set x = a + b, y = b + c, z = c + a. Then, since a, b, c are positive, x, y, z are positive. But then, how does ab + bc + ca relate to x, y, z? Let's compute:\n\nab + bc + ca = (a + b + c)^2 - (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) / 2? Wait, no. Wait, (a + b + c)^2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2(ab + bc + ca). So ab + bc + ca = [(a + b + c)^2 - (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)] / 2. Not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in a different way. Let's consider each term a / sqrt(a + b). Let me write this as a / sqrt(a + b) = sqrt(a) * sqrt(a) / sqrt(a + b). Then, perhaps apply H\u00f6lder's inequality. H\u00f6lder's inequality with exponents p, q such that 1/p + 1/q = 1. For example, if we take p = 2 and q = 2, then H\u00f6lder would give \u03a3 (a / sqrt(a + b)) \u2264 sqrt(\u03a3 a\u00b2) * sqrt(\u03a3 1/(a + b)). But again, this gives an upper bound, not a lower bound.\n\nWait, but we need a lower bound. So maybe we need to use the Cauchy-Schwarz in reverse, but I don't recall a direct inequality for that. Alternatively, maybe use the Titu's lemma, which is a form of Cauchy-Schwarz. Titu's lemma states that \u03a3 (x_i^2 / y_i) \u2265 (\u03a3 x_i)^2 / \u03a3 y_i. But here, the terms are a / sqrt(a + b), which is not exactly in the form of x_i^2 / y_i. Unless we can write it as (sqrt(a))^2 / sqrt(a + b). Then, applying Titu's lemma would give [ (sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c))^2 ] / [ sqrt(a + b) + sqrt(b + c) + sqrt(c + a) ). But that seems different from what we need. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality on the sum S. Let me write S as \u03a3 [ a / sqrt(a + b) ]. Let me consider vectors (a, b, c) and (1/sqrt(a + b), 1/sqrt(b + c), 1/sqrt(c + a)). Then, by Cauchy-Schwarz, S \u2264 sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) * sqrt(1/(a + b) + 1/(b + c) + 1/(c + a)). But again, this gives an upper bound, not a lower bound. So maybe this approach isn't helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps consider the function f(a, b, c) = a/\u221a(a + b) + b/\u221a(b + c) + c/\u221a(c + a). We need to find its minimum under the constraint ab + bc + ca \u2265 3. Maybe the minimum occurs when ab + bc + ca = 3, and when a = b = c. If that's the case, then the minimum would be 3/\u221a2, as when a = b = c = 1, ab + bc + ca = 3, and the sum is 3*(1)/\u221a(1 + 1) = 3/\u221a2. So perhaps we need to show that the sum is minimized when a = b = c = 1. But how to prove that?\n\nAlternatively, use the method of Lagrange multipliers. Let's set up the Lagrangian with the constraint ab + bc + ca = 3. But this might get complicated. Let's see. Let L = a/\u221a(a + b) + b/\u221a(b + c) + c/\u221a(c + a) - \u03bb(ab + bc + ca - 3). Taking partial derivatives with respect to a, b, c, set them to zero. But this seems messy. Maybe there's a symmetry here. If we assume a = b = c, then the derivative should be zero. Let's check. If a = b = c, then ab + bc + ca = 3a\u00b2 = 3 \u21d2 a = 1. Then, the sum is 3/\u221a2, which is the desired lower bound. So maybe this is the minimal case. But how to show that?\n\nAlternatively, use the technique of substitution. Let me set variables such that ab + bc + ca = 3. Then, perhaps use the inequality in terms of these variables. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another idea: Maybe use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in a different form. Let's consider each term a / \u221a(a + b). Let me write this as a / \u221a(a + b) = sqrt(a) * sqrt(a/(a + b)). Then, perhaps apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality on the sum of sqrt(a) * sqrt(a/(a + b)). So, \u03a3 sqrt(a) * sqrt(a/(a + b)) \u2264 sqrt( \u03a3 a ) * sqrt( \u03a3 a/(a + b) ). But again, this gives an upper bound. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the AM \u2265 GM inequality. For example, for each term a / \u221a(a + b), maybe relate it to some expression involving a and b. Let's see. If we can find a lower bound for each term, then summing them up would give a lower bound for the entire sum. But how?\n\nAlternatively, consider that since ab + bc + ca \u2265 3, and a, b, c are positive, perhaps we can relate each of a, b, c to 1. For example, if one variable is very large, then the product terms would be large, but maybe the sum would also be large. Wait, but we need a lower bound. So maybe the minimal case is when all variables are equal, as symmetry often gives extrema under symmetric constraints.\n\nAlternatively, use the method of Lagrange multipliers but with symmetry. Suppose a = b = c. Then, as we saw, the sum is 3/\u221a2. To check if this is the minimum, suppose we take a different set of variables. For example, let\u2019s take a = 2, b = 1, c such that ab + bc + ca = 3. Let's compute c. ab + bc + ca = 2*1 + 1*c + c*2 = 2 + 3c = 3 \u21d2 3c = 1 \u21d2 c = 1/3. Then compute the sum: a/\u221a(a + b) + b/\u221a(b + c) + c/\u221a(c + a) = 2/\u221a3 + 1/\u221a(1 + 1/3) + (1/3)/\u221a(1/3 + 2). Let's compute each term:\n\nFirst term: 2/\u221a3 \u2248 1.1547\n\nSecond term: 1/\u221a(4/3) = 1/(2/\u221a3) = \u221a3/2 \u2248 0.8660\n\nThird term: (1/3)/\u221a(7/3) = (1/3) / (\u221a7/\u221a3) = \u221a3/(3\u221a7) \u2248 0.1690\n\nSum \u2248 1.1547 + 0.8660 + 0.1690 \u2248 2.1897. Now, 3/\u221a2 \u2248 2.1213. So this sum is larger than 3/\u221a2. So in this case, the sum is larger. What if we take a = 3, b = 1, then ab = 3, so bc + ca = 0. But c must be positive, so this isn't possible. Wait, ab + bc + ca = 3. If a = 3, b = 1, then 3*1 + 1*c + c*3 = 3 + 4c = 3 \u21d2 4c = 0 \u21d2 c = 0, which is not allowed. So variables can't be too large. Let's try a = 1.5, b = 1. Then ab = 1.5. Then bc + ca = 1.5. So 1*c + 1.5*c = 2.5c = 1.5 \u21d2 c = 1.5 / 2.5 = 0.6. Then compute the sum:\n\na/\u221a(a + b) = 1.5/\u221a(2.5) \u2248 1.5/1.5811 \u2248 0.9487\n\nb/\u221a(b + c) = 1/\u221a(1 + 0.6) = 1/\u221a1.6 \u2248 0.7906\n\nc/\u221a(c + a) = 0.6/\u221a(0.6 + 1.5) = 0.6/\u221a2.1 \u2248 0.6/1.449 \u2248 0.414\n\nSum \u2248 0.9487 + 0.7906 + 0.414 \u2248 2.1533, which is still larger than 3/\u221a2 \u2248 2.1213. So even when variables are unequal, the sum is larger. This suggests that the minimal case is when a = b = c = 1. But how to formalize this?\n\nPerhaps use the method of Lagrange multipliers to show that the minimum occurs at a = b = c. Let's assume that a = b = c. Then, as we saw, the sum is 3/\u221a2. To show that this is the minimum, we need to show that any deviation from equality increases the sum. But how to do that without calculus?\n\nAlternatively, use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in a clever way. Let's consider each term a/\u221a(a + b). Let me square each term and sum them up. Wait, but squaring would complicate things. Alternatively, use H\u00f6lder's inequality. H\u00f6lder's inequality states that for p, q > 1 with 1/p + 1/q = 1, we have \u03a3 |f_i g_i| \u2264 (\u03a3 |f_i|^p)^{1/p} (\u03a3 |g_i|^q)^{1/q}. Let's see if we can apply H\u00f6lder here.\n\nLet\u2019s take p = 3 and q = 3/2, since 1/3 + 2/3 = 1. Then, H\u00f6lder's inequality would give:\n\n\u03a3 (a / \u221a(a + b)) \u2264 (\u03a3 a^3)^{1/3} (\u03a3 (1/(a + b))^{3/2})^{2/3}\n\nBut this seems complicated. Alternatively, take p = 2 and q = 2. Then, \u03a3 (a / \u221a(a + b)) \u2264 sqrt(\u03a3 a\u00b2) * sqrt(\u03a3 1/(a + b)). But again, this gives an upper bound.\n\nWait, maybe we need to use the given condition ab + bc + ca \u2265 3. Let's relate this to the denominators. For example, since a, b, c are positive, by AM \u2265 GM, we have a + b \u2265 2\u221a(ab). Similarly for b + c and c + a. Then, \u221a(a + b) \u2265 \u221a(2\u221a(ab)) = (2)^{1/2} (ab)^{1/4}. Then, 1/\u221a(a + b) \u2264 1/( (2)^{1/2} (ab)^{1/4} ). So, a / \u221a(a + b) \u2264 a / ( (2)^{1/2} (ab)^{1/4} ) = a / (2^{1/2} a^{1/4} b^{1/4} ) = a^{3/4} b^{-1/4} / 2^{1/2}.\n\nBut I'm not sure if this helps. Summing these terms would give something involving a^{3/4} b^{-1/4} + similar terms, which might not relate directly to ab + bc + ca.\n\nAlternatively, use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality on the sum S. Let's write S = \u03a3 [ a / \u221a(a + b) ]. Let's consider multiplying numerator and denominator by \u221a(a + b). Then, S = \u03a3 [ a / \u221a(a + b) ] = \u03a3 [ a * \u221a(a + b) / (a + b) ] = \u03a3 [ \u221aa * \u221aa * \u221a(a + b) / (a + b) ] = \u03a3 [ \u221aa / \u221a(a + b) * \u221aa ]. Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in the following way. For each term a / \u221a(a + b), we can pair a with \u221a(a + b). Let's consider:\n\n\u03a3 [ a / \u221a(a + b) ] = \u03a3 [ a / \u221a(a + b) ]\n\nLet me apply Cauchy-Schwarz to the sum \u03a3 (a / \u221a(a + b)) as follows:\n\n[ \u03a3 (a / \u221a(a + b)) ]^2 \u2264 [ \u03a3 a\u00b2 ] [ \u03a3 1/(a + b) ]\n\nBut this gives an upper bound, not a lower bound. So not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, reverse the roles. Maybe use the Cauchy-Schwarz in a different arrangement. Let's think of the sum as \u03a3 [ a / \u221a(a + b) ] = \u03a3 [ \u221aa * \u221aa / \u221a(a + b) ].\n\nThen, by Cauchy-Schwarz:\n\n[ \u03a3 (\u221aa * \u221aa / \u221a(a + b)) ] \u2264 sqrt( \u03a3 a ) * sqrt( \u03a3 a / (a + b) )\n\nBut again, upper bound. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, use the inequality between arithmetic mean and harmonic mean. For example, the denominators involve a + b, which is related to the harmonic mean. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let's think about the denominators. Each term has \u221a(a + b). If we can bound a + b from above, then 1/\u221a(a + b) would be bounded below, which would help in getting a lower bound for the entire sum. But how to relate a + b to ab + bc + ca.\n\nGiven that ab + bc + ca \u2265 3, and a, b, c > 0. By AM \u2265 GM, we have ab + bc + ca \u2265 3 (abc)^{2/3}. But since ab + bc + ca \u2265 3, this would imply that abc \u2264 1. Not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, use the inequality (a + b + c)^2 \u2265 3(ab + bc + ca). Since ab + bc + ca \u2265 3, this would imply (a + b + c)^2 \u2265 9 \u21d2 a + b + c \u2265 3. But how to use this.\n\nIf a + b + c \u2265 3, then perhaps each of a, b, c is at least something. But variables could be unequal. For example, a could be large while b and c are small, but then ab + bc + ca would need to be at least 3. For instance, if a is large, then",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to show that f is -10 and z is 7 given these two equations. The first equation is f + 3z = 11, and the second is 3(f - 1) -5z = -68. Hmm. So, the context mentioned something about solving simultaneous equations by subtracting multiples of one equation from another to eliminate variables. Let me try that approach here.\n\nFirst, maybe I can solve one of the equations for one variable and substitute into the other. Let's take the first equation: f + 3z = 11. If I solve for f, that would give me f = 11 - 3z. Then I can substitute this expression for f into the second equation. Let's try that.\n\nThe second equation is 3(f - 1) -5z = -68. Substitute f with (11 - 3z):\n\n3((11 - 3z) - 1) -5z = -68. Simplify inside the parentheses first: 11 - 3z -1 is 10 -3z. So now it's 3(10 -3z) -5z = -68. Multiply out the 3: 30 -9z -5z = -68. Combine like terms: 30 -14z = -68. Subtract 30 from both sides: -14z = -98. Divide both sides by -14: z = 7. Then plug back into f = 11 -3z: f = 11 -3*7 = 11 -21 = -10. That gives f = -10 and z =7. So that works.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use elimination. Let's write both equations again:\n\n1) f + 3z = 11\n\n2) 3f -3 -5z = -68. Wait, expanding the second equation: 3(f -1) is 3f -3, so the second equation becomes 3f -3 -5z = -68. Then add 3 to both sides: 3f -5z = -65.\n\nSo now the system is:\n\n1) f + 3z = 11\n\n2) 3f -5z = -65\n\nNow, maybe multiply equation 1 by 3 to make the coefficients of f the same. Then subtract. Let's see:\n\nMultiply equation 1 by 3: 3f +9z = 33.\n\nNow subtract this from equation 2: (3f -5z) - (3f +9z) = -65 -33. That gives 3f -5z -3f -9z = -98. Simplify: -14z = -98. So z = 7 again. Then substitute back into equation 1: f +21=11 \u2192 f= -10. Same result.\n\nWait, the context example had subtracting 2 times equation 1 from equation 2 to get an inconsistency. Here, when we subtract, we get a valid equation leading to z=7. So the key is manipulating the equations to eliminate one variable. Either substitution or elimination works. Both methods lead to the same solution. Therefore, the solution is f=-10 and z=7. Let me check if plugging these into the original equations works.\n\nFirst equation: -10 +3*7 = -10 +21 =11. Correct. Second equation: 3*(-10 -1) -5*7 = 3*(-11) -35 = -33 -35 = -68. Correct. So the solution satisfies both equations.

Hmm, how do I approach this?\n\nFirst, I remember that solving a linear congruence like ax \u2261 b mod m involves finding the multiplicative inverse of a modulo m, provided that a and m are coprime. Since 3 and 11 are both prime numbers, their greatest common divisor is 1, so they are coprime. That means 3 does have an inverse modulo 11. Once I find that inverse, I can multiply both sides of the congruence by it to isolate n.\n\nWait, how do I find the inverse of 3 mod 11? I think it's a number x such that 3x \u2261 1 mod 11. Let me try small numbers. Let's see:\n\n3*1 = 3 mod 11 \u2192 3\n3*2 = 6 mod 11 \u2192 6\n3*3 = 9 mod 11 \u2192 9\n3*4 = 12 mod 11 \u2192 1. Oh, there we go! So 3*4 \u2261 1 mod 11. Therefore, the inverse of 3 mod 11 is 4.\n\nNow, if I multiply both sides of the original congruence 3n \u2261 2 mod 11 by 4, I get:\n\n4*3n \u2261 4*2 mod 11\nWhich simplifies to (12)n \u2261 8 mod 11. But 12 mod 11 is 1, so this becomes 1n \u2261 8 mod 11, so n \u2261 8 mod 11.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Let me check if 8 is indeed the solution. Plugging back into the original equation: 3*8 = 24. 24 mod 11 is 24 - 2*11 = 2. Yes, 24 \u2261 2 mod 11. So that works.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this without inverses? Like trial and error? Since the modulus is 11, which isn't too big, I could test values of n from 0 to 10 until I find one that satisfies 3n \u2261 2 mod 11.\n\nLet's try that:\n\nn=0: 0*3=0 \u2192 0 mod 11 \u22602\nn=1: 3 \u21923\u22602\nn=2:6\u21926\u22602\nn=3:9\u21929\u22602\nn=4:12\u21921 mod11\u22602\nn=5:15\u21924 mod11\u22602\nn=6:18\u21927 mod11\u22602\nn=7:21\u219210 mod11\u22602\nn=8:24\u21922 mod11=2. Yep, that's it. So n=8 works.\n\nSo both methods confirm that n=8 is the solution. Therefore, the residue modulo 11 is 8.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo solve the congruence \\(3n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{11}\\), we need to find an integer \\(n\\) between \\(0\\) and \\(10\\) such that when \\(3n\\) is divided by \\(11\\), the remainder is \\(2\\). Here's how we can reason through it:\n\n1. **Identify the inverse of 3 modulo 11**:  \n   We need a number \\(x\\) such that \\(3x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}\\). Testing small values:  \n   - \\(3 \\times 1 = 3 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{11}\\)  \n   - \\(3 \\times 2 = 6 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{11}\\)  \n   - \\(3 \\times 4 = 12 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}\\) (since \\(12 - 11 = 1\\)).  \n   Thus, \\(x = 4\\) is the inverse of \\(3\\) modulo \\(11\\).\n\n2. **Multiply both sides of the congruence by the inverse**:  \n   Starting with \\(3n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{11}\\), multiply both sides by \\(4\\):  \n   \\[\n   4 \\times 3n \\equiv 4 \\times 2 \\pmod{11}.\n   \\]  \n   Simplifying the left side: \\(12n \\equiv 1n \\pmod{11}\\) (since \\(12 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}\\)).  \n   The right side becomes \\(8 \\pmod{11}\\).  \n   This reduces to:  \n   \\[\n   n \\equiv 8 \\pmod{11}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Verification**:  \n   Substitute \\(n = 8\\) back into the original congruence:  \n   \\(3 \\times 8 = 24\\), and \\(24 \\div 11\\) leaves a remainder of \\(2\\).  \n   Thus, \\(24 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{11}\\), confirming the solution.\n\n**Conclusion**: The solution to \\(3n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{11}\\) is \\(n \\equiv 8 \\pmod{11}\\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  3 * n % 11\nn : \u2115\nh\u2080 : 3 * n % 11 = 2\nh\u2081 : 3 * 4 % 11 = 1\n\u22a2 3 % 11 * (n % 11 % 11) % 11 = 2\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  3 * (n % 11) % 11\nn : \u2115\nh\u2080 : 3 * n % 11 = 2\nh\u2081 : 3 * 4 % 11 = 1\nh\u2082 : 3 * (n % 11) % 11 = 2\n\u22a2 3 * (4 * (n % 11)) % 11 = 2 * 4 % 11\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  3 * 4 * (n % 11) % 11\nn : \u2115\nh\u2080 : 3 * n % 11 = 2\nh\u2081 : 3 * 4 % 11 = 1\nh\u2082 : 3 * (n % 11) % 11 = 2\nh\u2083 : 3 * 4 * (n % 11) % 11 = 2 * 4 % 11\nh\u2084 : 2 * 4 % 11 = 8\nh\u2085 : 3 * 4 * (n % 11) % 11 = 8\n\u22a2 3 * (4 * (n % 11)) % 11 = 8\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  3 * 4 % 11\nn : \u2115\nh\u2080 : 3 * n % 11 = 2\nh\u2081 : 3 * 4 % 11 = 1\nh\u2082 : 3 * (n % 11) % 11 = 2\nh\u2083 : 3 * 4 * (n % 11) % 11 = 2 * 4 % 11\nh\u2084 : 2 * 4 % 11 = 8\nh\u2085 h\u2086 : 3 * 4 * (n % 11) % 11 = 8\n\u22a2 1 * (n % 11) % 11 = 8\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  1 * ?a\nn : \u2115\nh\u2080 : 3 * n % 11 = 2\nh\u2081 : 3 * 4 % 11 = 1\nh\u2082 : 3 * (n % 11) % 11 = 2\nh\u2083 : 3 * 4 * (n % 11) % 11 = 2 * 4 % 11\nh\u2084 : 2 * 4 % 11 = 8\nh\u2085 h\u2086 : 3 * 4 * (n % 11) % 11 = 8\nh\u2087 : 1 * (n % 11) % 11 = 8\n\u22a2 n % 11 = 8\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  3 * n % 11\nn : \u2115\nh\u2080 : 3 * n % 11 = 2\nh\u2081 : 3 * 4 % 11 = 1\n\u22a2 n % 11 * 3 % 11 = 2\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  3 * (n % 11) % 11\nn : \u2115\nh\u2080 : 3 * n % 11 = 2\nh\u2081 : 3 * 4 % 11 = 1\nh\u2082 : 3 * (n % 11) % 11 = 2\n\u22a2 3 * (4 * (n % 11)) % 11 = 2 * 4 % 11\nunsolved goals\nn : \u2115\nh\u2080 : 3 * n % 11 = 2\nh\u2081 : 3 * 4 % 11 = 1\nh\u2082 : 3 * (n % 11) % 11 = 2\nh\u2083 : 3 * 4 * (n % 11) % 11 = 8\nh\u2084 : 2 * 4 % 11 = 8\n\u22a2 3 * 4 * (n % 11) % 11 = 8\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  ?a * ?b * ?c\nn : \u2115\nh\u2080 : 3 * n % 11 = 2\nh\u2081 : 3 * 4 % 11 = 1\nh\u2082 : 3 * (n % 11) % 11 = 2\nh\u2083 : 3 * 4 * (n % 11) % 11 = 2 * 4 % 11\nh\u2084 : 2 * 4 % 11 = 8\nh\u2085 : 3 * 4 * (n % 11) % 11 = 8\n\u22a2 n % 11 * (3 * 4 % 11) % 11 = 8\nunsolved goals\nn : \u2115\nh\u2080 : 3 * n % 11 = 2\nh\u2081 : 3 * 4 % 11 = 1\nh\u2082 : 3 * (n % 11) % 11 = 2\nh\u2083 : 3 * 4 * (n % 11) % 11 = 2 * 4 % 11\nh\u2084 : 2 * 4 % 11 = 8\nh\u2085 : 3 * 4 * (n % 11) % 11 = 8\nh\u2086 : n % 11 % 11 = 8\n\u22a2 n % 11 = 8\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  10\nn : \u2115\nh\u2080 : 3 * n % 11 = 2\nh\u2081 : 3 * 4 % 11 = 1\n\u22a2 n % 11 = 8\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to show that the product of (1 + 1/2^k) from k=1 to n is less than 5/2 for any positive integer n. Let me start by understanding what the product looks like. For each term in the product, it's 1 plus 1 over 2 to the k. So for k=1, it's 1 + 1/2 = 3/2. For k=2, it's 1 + 1/4 = 5/4, and so on. Multiplying these terms together, each subsequent term is getting closer to 1, but they're all greater than 1. So the product is increasing, but maybe it converges to some limit less than 5/2?\n\nWait, the problem says for any positive integer n, so even as n approaches infinity, the product should still be less than 5/2. Hmm. Maybe I can find an upper bound for the product. Let me think about how to approach this. Maybe taking the logarithm of the product to turn it into a sum? That might help. If I take the natural log of the product, it becomes the sum from k=1 to n of ln(1 + 1/2^k). Then, if I can bound this sum, I can exponentiate to get back to the original product.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the easiest way. Alternatively, maybe there's a telescoping product or a known formula for such products. Let me think about similar products. For example, the infinite product of (1 + x^k) for |x| < 1 has a known expression, but I don't remember the exact form. Maybe that's not helpful here. Alternatively, perhaps I can compare each term to something else that's easier to multiply.\n\nWait, the example in the context was about termial, but that seems unrelated. The example showed that \u00bd? (termial of \u00bd) equals 3/8. But termial is usually defined for integers as the sum from 1 to n, but here they applied it to a fraction. Maybe that's a red herring. Let me focus back on the product.\n\nLet me compute the product for small n to see the pattern. For n=1: 3/2 = 1.5. For n=2: (3/2)(5/4) = 15/8 = 1.875. For n=3: 15/8 * 9/8 = 135/64 \u2248 2.109. For n=4: 135/64 * 17/16 = 2295/1024 \u2248 2.242. For n=5: 2295/1024 * 33/32 \u2248 2.337. For n=6: multiply by 1 + 1/64 = 65/64, so \u22482.337 * 1.0156 \u22482.372. Hmm, it's increasing but slowly. Maybe it approaches a limit less than 5/2 (which is 2.5). So maybe the infinite product is less than 5/2, and thus all finite products are also less than that.\n\nBut how to prove it? Maybe by induction. Let's try induction. Base case n=1: 3/2 < 5/2, which is true. Assume that for some n \u22651, the product up to n is less than 5/2. Then for n+1, the product is the previous product times (1 + 1/2^{n+1}). Since 1 + 1/2^{n+1} < 1 + 1/2^{n}, and since the previous product is less than 5/2, but this approach might not work directly because multiplying by a term greater than 1 could still keep it under 5/2 if the terms decrease sufficiently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe find an upper bound for the infinite product and show that even as n approaches infinity, the product remains below 5/2. Let's consider the infinite product. The infinite product of (1 + 1/2^k) from k=1 to infinity. If I can show that this product converges to a value less than 5/2, then all finite products are also less than that.\n\nTo compute the infinite product, maybe take the logarithm. Let P = product_{k=1}^\u221e (1 + 1/2^k). Then ln P = sum_{k=1}^\u221e ln(1 + 1/2^k). Now, since 1/2^k is small for large k, maybe approximate ln(1 + x) \u2248 x - x^2/2 for small x. But this might get complicated. Alternatively, compare the sum to a geometric series. Since ln(1 + x) < x for x >0, then sum_{k=1}^\u221e ln(1 + 1/2^k) < sum_{k=1}^\u221e 1/2^k = 1. So ln P <1, so P < e \u22482.718. But 5/2 is 2.5, which is less than e. So this approach gives an upper bound of e, which is larger than 5/2. So that's not helpful.\n\nWait, but maybe we can get a tighter bound. Let's see. The sum ln(1 + 1/2^k) can be written as sum_{k=1}^\u221e (1/2^k - 1/(2*2^{2k}) + ... ) using the Taylor series expansion ln(1+x) = x - x^2/2 + x^3/3 - ... So the sum would be sum_{k=1}^\u221e [1/2^k - 1/(2*4^k) + 1/(3*8^k) - ...]. Then summing these terms, maybe we can get a better estimate. The first term sum 1/2^k is 1. The second term sum -1/(2*4^k) is -1/2 * (1/4 + 1/16 + ...) = -1/2 * (1/3) = -1/6. Then the next term would be sum 1/(3*8^k) which is 1/3 * (1/8 + 1/64 + ...) = 1/3 * (1/7) = 1/21. So ln P \u22481 -1/6 +1/21 \u22481 -0.1667 +0.0476\u22480.8809. Then P \u2248e^{0.8809}\u22482.412, which is less than 5/2=2.5. So maybe the infinite product is around 2.4, which is less than 2.5. Therefore, the infinite product is less than 5/2, so all finite products are also less than 5/2.\n\nBut this is an approximation. How can we make this rigorous? Maybe use an inequality that ln(1+x) \u2264x -x^2/2 +x^3/3 for x>0. Wait, but I need to bound the sum from above. Alternatively, since ln(1+x) <x for x>0, but that gives us ln P <1, which is not tight enough. But if we can get a better upper bound for ln(1+x). Let's think: For x>0, ln(1+x) \u2264x -x^2/2 +x^3/3. But maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, for 0<x\u22641/2, since 1/2^k \u22641/2 for k\u22651, then ln(1+x) \u2264x -x^2/2 +x^3/3 - ... which alternates signs. But since x is positive and decreasing, maybe we can bound the sum by the first few terms.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the product can be expressed in terms of a telescoping product. Let me think: (1 +1/2)(1 +1/4)(1 +1/8)...(1 +1/2^n). Each term is 1 +1/2^k. Maybe there's a way to write this product as a fraction that telescopes. For example, 1 +1/2 =3/2, 1 +1/4=5/4, 1 +1/8=9/8, etc. So the product is (3/2)(5/4)(9/8)... Each numerator is 2^{k}+1, and denominator is 2^{k}. Wait, for k=1: 2^1 +1=3, denominator 2^1=2. For k=2: 2^2 +1=5, denominator 4. For k=3: 2^3 +1=9, denominator 8. So the general term is (2^k +1)/2^k. So the product becomes product_{k=1}^n (2^k +1)/2^k.\n\nHmm, maybe we can write this as product_{k=1}^n (1 +1/2^k) = product_{k=1}^n (2^k +1)/2^k = product_{k=1}^n (2^k +1) / product_{k=1}^n 2^k. The denominator is 2^{1+2+...+n} =2^{n(n+1)/2}. The numerator is product_{k=1}^n (2^k +1). Not sure if that helps. Maybe there's a formula for product_{k=1}^n (2^k +1). Let me check small n:\n\nn=1: 3\n\nn=2:3*5=15\n\nn=3:15*9=135\n\nn=4:135*17=2295\n\nWait, these numbers look familiar. For example, 3, 15, 135, 2295... Not sure. Alternatively, maybe relate this product to binary representations or something else. Alternatively, consider that 2^k +1 = (2^{k+1} -1)/(2 -1) when considering geometric series, but that doesn't seem directly applicable.\n\nAlternatively, note that (2^k +1) = (2^{2k} -1)/(2^k -1). Wait, let's check: (2^k -1)(2^k +1) =2^{2k} -1. So yes, 2^k +1 = (2^{2k} -1)/(2^k -1). So product_{k=1}^n (2^k +1) = product_{k=1}^n (2^{2k} -1)/(2^k -1). Let's see:\n\nFor k=1: (2^2 -1)/(2^1 -1)=3/1=3\n\nFor k=2: (2^4 -1)/(2^2 -1)=15/3=5\n\nFor k=3: (2^6 -1)/(2^3 -1)=63/7=9\n\nSo product_{k=1}^n (2^{2k} -1)/(2^k -1) = product_{k=1}^n (2^{k} +1) =3*5*9*... as before. But this seems like it's telescoping. Let's see:\n\nThe product becomes [(2^2 -1)/(2^1 -1)] * [(2^4 -1)/(2^2 -1)] * [(2^6 -1)/(2^3 -1)] * ... * [(2^{2n} -1)/(2^n -1)]. Notice that each denominator cancels with the numerator of the previous term. For example, the denominator of the first term is (2^1 -1)=1, the numerator is (2^2 -1)=3. The denominator of the second term is (2^2 -1)=3, which cancels with the numerator of the first term. Wait, no, the first term's numerator is (2^2 -1)=3, and the denominator of the second term is (2^2 -1)=3. So the 3 cancels. Similarly, the numerator of the second term is (2^4 -1)=15, and the denominator of the third term is (2^3 -1)=7, which doesn't cancel. Wait, maybe this approach isn't leading to cancellation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the product telescopes in a different way. Let me think again. The product of (2^k +1) from k=1 to n. Let's write each term as (2^k +1) = (2^{k} +1). Maybe there's a relation between consecutive terms. For example, 2^{k+1} +1 =2*2^k +1. Not sure. Alternatively, consider that 2^{k} +1 = (2^{k} -1) +2. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the product up to n is related to 2^{2n} -1. Wait, for example, product_{k=1}^n (2^k +1) = (2^{n+1} -1). Let me check for n=1: 3 vs 2^{2} -1=3. Yes. For n=2:3*5=15 vs 2^{3} -1=7. No. Wait, that doesn't work. Hmm. Maybe another pattern. For n=1:3=2^2 -1. For n=2:3*5=15=2^4 -1. For n=3:15*9=135=2^7 -1? 2^7=128, 128-1=127. No. Wait, 2^4 -1=15, which is n=2. 2^8 -1=255, which is 3*5*17=255. Wait, 3*5*17=255. So for n=3, the product is 3*5*9=135, which is not 2^8 -1=255. So that approach doesn't hold.\n\nMaybe there's a different telescoping product. Let me think again. The original product is product_{k=1}^n (1 +1/2^k). Let me take the logarithm again. Let\u2019s denote P_n = product_{k=1}^n (1 +1/2^k). Then ln P_n = sum_{k=1}^n ln(1 +1/2^k). To bound this sum, maybe use the inequality ln(1+x) \u2264x for x>0. Then ln P_n \u2264 sum_{k=1}^n 1/2^k =1 -1/2^n <1. So P_n <e\u22482.718. But we need to show P_n <5/2=2.5. So this bound is not tight enough. But maybe we can get a better bound by considering more terms in the expansion of ln(1+x).\n\nFor example, ln(1+x) \u2264x -x^2/2 +x^3/3. Let's check for x=1/2: ln(3/2)\u22480.4055. The right-hand side is 1/2 -1/8 +1/24= (12/24 -3/24 +1/24)=10/24\u22480.4167, which is larger than the actual value, so the inequality ln(1+x) \u2264x -x^2/2 +x^3/3 holds for x>0. Wait, but if we use this, then sum_{k=1}^\u221e ln(1+1/2^k) \u2264 sum_{k=1}^\u221e [1/2^k -1/(2*4^k) +1/(3*8^k) - ...]. But summing these terms:\n\nSum of 1/2^k from k=1 to \u221e is 1.\n\nSum of -1/(2*4^k) from k=1 to \u221e is -1/2 * (1/4 +1/16 + ...) = -1/2 * (1/(4-1)) )= -1/2 *1/3= -1/6.\n\nSum of 1/(3*8^k) from k=1 to \u221e is 1/3 * (1/8 +1/64 + ...) =1/3 * (1/(8-1))=1/21.\n\nSimilarly, higher terms would be even smaller. So the total sum would be approximately 1 -1/6 +1/21 - ... \u22480.8809, as before. So ln P \u22480.8809, so P\u2248e^{0.8809}\u22482.412, which is less than 2.5. Therefore, the infinite product is less than 5/2, and thus all finite products are also less than 5/2.\n\nBut to make this rigorous, I need to bound the sum of ln(1+1/2^k) from above by something less than ln(5/2). Let's compute ln(5/2)\u22480.9163. So if the sum of ln(1+1/2^k) <0.9163, then exponentiating gives P <5/2. But from the approximation, the sum is around 0.8809, which is less than 0.9163. So maybe this works. But how to make this precise?\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the inequality ln(1+x) \u2264x -x^2/2 +x^3/3 for x>0. Then sum_{k=1}^\u221e ln(1+1/2^k) \u2264 sum_{k=1}^\u221e [1/2^k -1/(2*4^k) +1/(3*8^k)]. Let's compute this sum:\n\nSum of 1/2^k =1.\n\nSum of -1/(2*4^k) = -1/2 * sum_{k=1}^\u221e (1/4)^k = -1/2 * (1/4)/(1-1/4)) = -1/2 * (1/3) = -1/6.\n\nSum of 1/(3*8^k) =1/3 * sum_{k=1}^\u221e (1/8)^k =1/3 * (1/7) =1/21.\n\nSo total sum \u22641 -1/6 +1/21 \u22481 -0.1667 +0.0476\u22480.8809. Then ln P \u22640.8809, so P \u2264e^{0.8809}\u22482.412<2.5. Therefore, the infinite product is less than 5/2, so all finite products are also less than 5/2.\n\nBut wait, this uses an upper bound on the sum. However, the inequality ln(1+x) \u2264x -x^2/2 +x^3/3 is valid for x>0? Let me check for x=1/2: ln(3/2)\u22480.4055. The right-hand side is 1/2 - (1/2)^2/2 + (1/2)^3/3 =0.5 -",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the radius of the circle given by the equation x\u00b2 + 8x + y\u00b2 - 6y = 0 and show that it's 5. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the general equation of a circle is usually written in the form (x - a)\u00b2 + (y - b)\u00b2 = R\u00b2, where (a, b) is the center and R is the radius. But the given equation isn't in that standard form. Instead, it's in a form where the x and y terms are linear. So, I think I need to complete the square for both the x and y terms to convert this equation into the standard circle form.\n\nLooking back at the context provided, there's a theorem about the equation A(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) + Bx + Cy + D = 0 representing a circle under certain conditions. Comparing that to the given problem, here A is 1 because the coefficients of x\u00b2 and y\u00b2 are both 1. So, in this case, A = 1, B = 8 (coefficient of x), C = -6 (coefficient of y), and D = 0 (since there's no constant term on the left side; the equation equals zero).\n\nThe theorem states that the radius R is (1/(2A)) * sqrt(B\u00b2 + C\u00b2 - 4AD). Plugging in the values from the problem: A = 1, B = 8, C = -6, D = 0. Let's compute that. First, calculate B\u00b2 + C\u00b2: 8\u00b2 is 64, (-6)\u00b2 is 36. Adding those gives 64 + 36 = 100. Then subtract 4AD: since D is 0, that term is 0. So we have sqrt(100 - 0) = sqrt(100) = 10. Then multiply by 1/(2*1) which is 1/2. So R = (1/2)*10 = 5. That gives the radius as 5, which is what we needed to show.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should verify by completing the square manually to ensure that this method works. Let's try that. Starting with the original equation: x\u00b2 + 8x + y\u00b2 - 6y = 0.\n\nFor the x terms: x\u00b2 + 8x. To complete the square, take half of 8, which is 4, square it to get 16. So add and subtract 16: (x\u00b2 + 8x +16) -16.\n\nFor the y terms: y\u00b2 -6y. Half of -6 is -3, square it to get 9. Add and subtract 9: (y\u00b2 -6y +9) -9.\n\nPutting it all together: (x\u00b2 +8x +16) -16 + (y\u00b2 -6y +9) -9 = 0. Simplify the left side: (x+4)\u00b2 + (y-3)\u00b2 -25 = 0. Then move the -25 to the other side: (x+4)\u00b2 + (y-3)\u00b2 = 25. So the equation is now in standard form, where the center is (-4, 3) and the radius is sqrt(25) = 5. That matches the previous calculation using the theorem's formula. So both methods confirm that the radius is indeed 5.\n\nWait, but in the theorem, the center coordinates are (-B/(2A), -C/(2A)). Here, A is 1, B is 8, so -B/(2A) is -8/2 = -4. Similarly, C is -6, so -C/(2A) is -(-6)/2 = 3. So the center is (-4, 3), which matches the center we found by completing the square. That's consistent. The radius formula from the theorem gives R = 5, which is exactly sqrt(25). So everything checks out.\n\nTherefore, using either the direct formula from the theorem or completing the square manually leads to the conclusion that the radius is 5. The key steps were recognizing the general form of the circle equation, applying the formula for the radius from the theorem (which itself is derived by completing the square), and verifying through direct computation. The conditions given in the theorem are satisfied here: A = 1 > 0, and B\u00b2 + C\u00b2 -4AD = 100 -0 =100 \u22650, so the equation does represent a circle with real radius.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo find the radius of the circle given by the equation \\(x^2 + 8x + y^2 - 6y = 0\\), we can use the method of completing the square or directly apply the formula from the provided theorem. Here's a step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Recognize the general form**: The equation resembles the standard circle equation \\(A(x^2 + y^2) + Bx + Cy + D = 0\\) from the theorem. Here, \\(A = 1\\), \\(B = 8\\), \\(C = -6\\), and \\(D = 0\\).\n\n2. **Apply the radius formula**:  \n   The theorem states that the radius \\(R\\) is:  \n   \\[\n   R = \\frac{1}{2A} \\sqrt{B^2 + C^2 - 4AD}.\n   \\]  \n   Substituting the values:  \n   \\[\n   R = \\frac{1}{2 \\cdot 1} \\sqrt{8^2 + (-6)^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 0} = \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{64 + 36} = \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{100} = \\frac{10}{2} = 5.\n   \\]  \n   This directly gives \\(R = 5\\).\n\n3. **Verify by completing the square**:  \n   - For the \\(x\\)-terms:  \n     \\(x^2 + 8x\\) becomes \\((x + 4)^2 - 16\\) (adding and subtracting \\(16\\)).  \n   - For the \\(y\\)-terms:  \n     \\(y^2 - 6y\\) becomes \\((y - 3)^2 - 9\\) (adding and subtracting \\(9\\)).  \n   - Substitute back into the original equation:  \n     \\[\n     (x + 4)^2 - 16 + (y - 3)^2 - 9 = 0 \\implies (x + 4)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 25.\n     \\]  \n   - The standard form \\((x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 = R^2\\) confirms the radius \\(R = \\sqrt{25} = 5\\).\n\n4. **Check consistency with the theorem**:  \n   The center coordinates from the theorem are \\(\\left(-\\frac{B}{2A}, -\\frac{C}{2A}\\right)\\), which here gives \\(\\left(-4, 3\\right)\\). This matches the center derived from completing the square. The conditions \\(A > 0\\) and \\(B^2 + C^2 \\geq 4AD\\) are satisfied (\\(1 > 0\\) and \\(100 \\geq 0\\)), ensuring the equation represents a valid circle.\n\nThus, both methods confirm that the radius of the circle is **5**.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  x ^ 2 + 8 * x + y ^ 2 - 6 * y\nx y : \u211d\nh\u2080 : x ^ 2 + 8 * x + y ^ 2 - 6 * y = 0\nh\u2081 : (x + 4) ^ 2 + (y - 3) ^ 2 = x ^ 2 + 8 * x + 16 + y ^ 2 - 6 * y + 9\n\u22a2 x ^ 2 + 8 * x + 16 + y ^ 2 - 6 * y + 9 = 5 ^ 2\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is to show that if n is a positive integer and 2^n minus 1 is prime, then n must be prime. Hmm. I remember that primes of the form 2^p - 1 are called Mersenne primes, right? And the key thing here is that p has to be a prime number. But why is that the case?\n\nSo, the goal is to prove that if 2^n - 1 is prime, then n itself has to be prime. Let me think about how to approach this. Maybe I can use a proof by contradiction. Suppose n is not prime, so it's composite. Then n can be written as a product of two integers greater than 1, say n = a*b where a and b are both greater than 1. Then, maybe I can factor 2^n - 1 in terms of a and b.\n\nWait, there's a formula for factoring numbers like 2^(ab) - 1. Let me recall. For example, 2^(ab) - 1 can be factored as (2^a - 1)(2^(a(b-1)) + 2^(a(b-2)) + ... + 1). So if n is composite, then 2^n - 1 can be factored into smaller integers, which would mean it's not prime. Therefore, if 2^n -1 is prime, n can't be composite, so it must be prime. That seems like the right approach.\n\nLet me check with an example. Take n=4, which is composite. Then 2^4 -1 = 15, which is 3*5, composite. Another example: n=6, which is composite. 2^6 -1 = 63 = 7*9, again composite. So when n is composite, 2^n -1 is composite. Therefore, if 2^n -1 is prime, n can't be composite, so n must be prime. That makes sense.\n\nBut wait, what if n is prime? Does that guarantee 2^n -1 is prime? No, because for example, n=11 is prime, but 2^11 -1 = 2047 = 23*89, which is composite. So the converse isn't true. But the original statement is only that if 2^n -1 is prime, then n must be prime. Which is what we need to prove.\n\nSo the key idea is that if n is composite, then 2^n -1 is composite. Therefore, the contrapositive is: if n is composite, then 2^n -1 is composite. Hence, if 2^n -1 is prime, n must be prime. That's the structure of the proof.\n\nLet me formalize this. Suppose n is composite. Then n = a*b where a, b >1. Then 2^n -1 = 2^(ab) -1. Using the formula for difference of powers, we can factor this as (2^a -1)(2^(a(b-1)) + 2^(a(b-2)) + ... + 1). Both factors are greater than 1, so 2^n -1 is composite. Therefore, if 2^n -1 is prime, n cannot be composite, so n must be prime.\n\nYes, that seems solid. I should make sure to explain the factoring step clearly. Maybe use a specific example to illustrate. For instance, take n=6=2*3. Then 2^6 -1 = 64 -1 = 63. Factoring as (2^2 -1)(2^4 + 2^2 +1) = 3*21 = 63. So it works. Therefore, the factorization holds, and thus if n is composite, 2^n -1 is composite. Hence, the original statement holds.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo show that if \\( n \\) is a positive integer and \\( 2^n - 1 \\) is prime, then \\( n \\) must be prime, we use a proof by contrapositive. Instead of proving the original statement directly, we prove its equivalent contrapositive: **if \\( n \\) is composite (not prime), then \\( 2^n - 1 \\) is composite**.\n\n### Step 1: Assume \\( n \\) is composite.\nIf \\( n \\) is composite, it can be written as \\( n = a \\cdot b \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are integers greater than 1. For example, if \\( n = 6 \\), we could write \\( 6 = 2 \\cdot 3 \\).\n\n### Step 2: Factor \\( 2^n - 1 \\).\nUsing the identity for factoring exponents, we know that:\n\\[\n2^{ab} - 1 = (2^a - 1)(2^{a(b-1)} + 2^{a(b-2)} + \\cdots + 2^a + 1).\n\\]\nThis works because \\( 2^{ab} - 1 \\) is a geometric series in disguise. For instance, if \\( n = 6 = 2 \\cdot 3 \\), then:\n\\[\n2^6 - 1 = (2^2 - 1)(2^4 + 2^2 + 1) = 3 \\cdot 21 = 63,\n\\]\nwhich is clearly composite.\n\n### Step 3: Both factors are greater than 1.\nSince \\( a > 1 \\), the first term \\( 2^a - 1 \\) is at least \\( 2^2 - 1 = 3 \\). The second term \\( (2^{a(b-1)} + \\cdots + 1) \\) is also greater than 1 because all its terms are positive. Thus, \\( 2^n - 1 \\) splits into a product of two integers greater than 1, making it composite.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion.\nIf \\( n \\) were composite, \\( 2^n - 1 \\) would necessarily be composite. Therefore, **if \\( 2^n - 1 \\) is prime**, the assumption that \\( n \\) is composite leads to a contradiction. Hence, \\( n \\) must be prime.\n\nThis reasoning aligns with known examples like \\( n = 3 \\) (where \\( 2^3 - 1 = 7 \\), prime) and avoids cases like \\( n = 4 \\) (where \\( 2^4 - 1 = 15 \\), composite). The key insight is that composite exponents force factorizations, ruling out primality.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unexpected token '...'; expected term\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unexpected token '...'; expected term\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unexpected token '...'; expected term\nPlease revise the proof.",

Hmm, how do I approach this?\n\nAlright, so there are two numbers. Let's call them x and y, where x is the larger one and y is the smaller one. The sum is x + y = 25, and the difference is x - y = 11. I need to solve these two equations to find x and y.\n\nWait, solving two equations with two variables. That sounds like a system of equations. Maybe I can add the two equations together. If I add x + y = 25 and x - y = 11, the y terms would cancel out. Let's try that:\n\nAdding left sides: x + y + x - y = 2x\nAdding right sides: 25 + 11 = 36\nSo 2x = 36, which means x = 18. Oh, that's the answer we're supposed to show. Then y would be 25 - 18 = 7. Let me check if the difference is 11: 18 - 7 = 11. Yep, that works.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should explain it step by step. First, define the variables. Let x be the larger number and y the smaller. Then set up the equations based on the problem statement. Then solve them by elimination. Adding the equations eliminates y, solving for x, then substituting back to find y. Then verify both conditions are satisfied. That makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, could I use substitution? Like solve one equation for one variable and plug into the other. For example, from x + y = 25, solve for y = 25 - x. Then substitute into x - y = 11: x - (25 - x) = 11. Simplify: x -25 + x = 11 \u2192 2x -25 =11 \u2192 2x=36 \u2192 x=18. Same result. Either method works.\n\nBut the problem specifically asks to show that the larger number is 18. So either approach leads to x=18, which is the larger number. Then verifying that with the original equations confirms it. The key steps are setting up the equations correctly and solving them using either elimination or substitution. Both methods lead to the same answer, so either is valid. The important part is clearly showing the steps and verifying the solution meets both conditions given in the problem.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nLet's call the two numbers we're trying to find \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), where \\( x \\) is the larger number and \\( y \\) is the smaller one.

Hmm, how do I approach this?\n\nFirst, looking at the numerator and the denominator, both have terms with exponents of 2. The exponents are 2014 and 2012. I notice that 2014 is 2012 + 2, so maybe I can factor out a common term. Let me try that.\n\nIn the numerator: 2^{2014} + 2^{2012}. If I factor out 2^{2012} from both terms, that would be 2^{2012}(2^2 + 1). Because 2^{2014} is 2^{2012} * 2^2, right? So 2^2 is 4, so 4 + 1 is 5. So the numerator becomes 2^{2012} * 5.\n\nSimilarly, the denominator is 2^{2014} - 2^{2012}. Again, factor out 2^{2012}, which gives 2^{2012}(2^2 - 1). Here, 2^2 is 4, so 4 - 1 is 3.

Let's try that. The numerator becomes (2^{2014}/2^{2012}) + 1, which is 2^{2} + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5. The denominator becomes (2^{2014}/2^{2012}) - 1, which is 4 - 1 = 3. So again, 5/3. Yep, that works too.

The question says that the sum of the squares of three consecutive positive even numbers is 12296, and we need to find the product of these three numbers divided by 8, which should be 32736. Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what consecutive positive even numbers are. Consecutive even numbers are numbers like 2, 4, 6 or 4, 6, 8, where each number is 2 more than the previous one. So if we let the first even number be x, the next two would be x + 2 and x + 4.

Let me write that down:\n\nx\u00b2 + (x + 2)\u00b2 + (x + 4)\u00b2 = 12296.\n\nNext, I need to expand these squares and solve for x. Let's expand each term:\n\nFirst term: x\u00b2 is just x squared.\n\nSecond term: (x + 2)\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + 4x + 4.\n\nThird term: (x + 4)\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + 8x + 16.\n\nNow, adding all these together:\n\nx\u00b2 + (x\u00b2 + 4x + 4) + (x\u00b2 + 8x + 16) = 12296.\n\nCombine like terms. Let's add up the x\u00b2 terms: x\u00b2 + x\u00b2 + x\u00b2 = 3x\u00b2.\n\nThen the x terms: 4x + 8x = 12x.\n\nFinally, the constants: 4 + 16 = 20.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n3x\u00b2 + 12x + 20 = 12296.\n\nNow, subtract 12296 from both sides to set the equation to zero:\n\n3x\u00b2 + 12x + 20 - 12296 = 0\n\nSimplify the constants:\n\n3x\u00b2 + 12x - 12276 = 0.\n\nWe can divide the entire equation by 3 to simplify:\n\nx\u00b2 + 4x - 4092 = 0.\n\nNow, we have a quadratic equation: x\u00b2 + 4x - 4092 = 0.\n\nTo solve this quadratic equation, we can use the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is x = [-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)] / (2a), where a = 1, b = 4, and c = -4092.\n\nLet's compute the discriminant first: b\u00b2 - 4ac = (4)\u00b2 - 4(1)(-4092) = 16 + 16368 = 16384.\n\nThe square root of 16384 is 128, because 128 * 128 = 16384. So, the solutions are:\n\nx = [-4 \u00b1 128]/2.\n\nWe have two solutions here:\n\n1. x = (-4 + 128)/2 = 124/2 = 62\n2. x = (-4 - 128)/2 = -132/2 = -66\n\nBut since we're dealing with positive even numbers, x must be positive. So x = 62.\n\nTherefore, the three consecutive even numbers are 62, 64, and 66.\n\nNow, we need to find the product of these three numbers divided by 8. Let's compute the product first:\n\n62 * 64 * 66.\n\nLet me calculate this step by step. First, 62 * 64. Let's do 60*64 = 3840, and 2*64=128, so 3840 + 128 = 3968.\n\nThen multiply that by 66. Let's break it down: 3968 * 60 = 238,080 and 3968 * 6 = 23,808. Adding those together: 238,080 + 23,808 = 261,888.\n\nNow, divide that product by 8: 261,888 / 8 = 32,736.\n\nSo, the product of the three numbers divided by 8 is indeed 32,736, which matches the value given in the problem. Therefore, the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nLet's start by defining the three consecutive positive even numbers. Since even numbers differ by 2, we can represent them as \\( x \\), \\( x + 2 \\), and \\( x + 4 \\), where \\( x \\) is a positive even integer. The problem states that the sum of their squares equals \\( 12296 \\):\n\n\\[\nx^2 + (x + 2)^2 + (x + 4)^2 = 12296.\n\\]\n\nExpanding the squares:\n\n\\[\nx^2 + (x^2 + 4x + 4) + (x^2 + 8x + 16) = 12296.\n\\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\[\n3x^2 + 12x + 20 = 12296.\n\\]\n\nSubtract \\( 12296 \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n3x^2 + 12x - 12276 = 0.\n\\]\n\nDivide the entire equation by \\( 3 \\) to simplify:\n\n\\[\nx^2 + 4x - 4092 = 0.\n\\]\n\nSolve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \\( x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\), where \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 4 \\), and \\( c = -4092 \\):\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 + 16368}}{2} = \\frac{-4 \\pm 128}{2}.\n\\]\n\nThis yields two solutions:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{124}{2} = 62 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x = \\frac{-132}{2} = -66.\n\\]\n\nSince \\( x \\) must be positive, we discard \\( -66 \\). Thus, the numbers are \\( 62 \\), \\( 64 \\), and \\( 66 \\).\n\nNext, compute their product:\n\n\\[\n62 \\times 64 \\times 66 = 261,\\!888.\n\\]\n\nDivide by \\( 8 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{261,\\!888}{8} = 32,\\!736.\n\\]\n\nThis confirms that the product of the three numbers divided by \\( 8 \\) is indeed \\( 32,\\!736 \\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: unsolved goals\ncase h\nn : \u2115\nh\u2081 : (\u2191n - 2) ^ 2 + \u2191n ^ 2 + (\u2191n + 2) ^ 2 = 12296\nk : \u2115\nhk : n = k + k\n\u22a2 \u2191(k * 2) = \u2191k * 2\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase intro.h1.h\nn : \u2115\nh\u2080 : Even n\nk : \u2124\nh\u2081 : (2 * k - 2) ^ 2 + (2 * k) ^ 2 + (2 * k + 2) ^ 2 = 12296\nhk : \u2191n = 2 * k\na\u271d : (2 * k - 2) * (2 * k) * (2 * k + 2) / 8 < 32736\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unsolved goals\nn k : \u2115\nhk : n = k + k\nh\u2081 : 8 + (k * 2) ^ 2 * 3 = 12296\n\u22a2 4 + k * 8 + k ^ 2 * 8 + (k * 2 - 2) ^ 2 = 8 + k ^ 2 * 12\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  12296\nn k : \u2115\nhk : n = k + k\nh\u2081 : 8 + (k * 2) ^ 2 * 3 = 12296\nh\u2082 : (2 * k - 2) ^ 2 + (2 * k) ^ 2 + (2 * k + 2) ^ 2 = 12296\n\u22a2 3 * (2 * k) ^ 2 + 12 * (2 * k) - 4092 = 0\nunsolved goals\nn k : \u2115\nhk : n = k + k\nh\u2081 : 8 + (k * 2) ^ 2 * 3 = 12296\nh\u2082 : (2 * k - 2) ^ 2 + (2 * k) ^ 2 + (2 * k + 2) ^ 2 = 12296\nh\u2083 : 3 * (2 * k) ^ 2 + 12 * (2 * k) - 4092 = 0\n\u22a2 False\nunsolved goals\nn k : \u2115\nhk : n = k + k\nh\u2081 : 8 + (k * 2) ^ 2 * 3 = 12296\nh\u2082 : (2 * k - 2) ^ 2 + (2 * k) ^ 2 + (2 * k + 2) ^ 2 = 12296\nh\u2083 : 3 * (2 * k) ^ 2 + 12 * (2 * k) - 4092 = 0\ndiscriminant : 12 ^ 2 - 4 * 3 * -4092 = 16384\n\u22a2 \u221a16384 = 128\nfailed to synthesize\n  Neg \u2115\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  128\nn k : \u2115\nhk : n = k + k\nh\u2081 : 8 + (k * 2) ^ 2 * 3 = 12296\nh\u2082 : (2 * k - 2) ^ 2 + (2 * k) ^ 2 + (2 * k + 2) ^ 2 = 12296\nh\u2083 : 3 * (2 * k) ^ 2 + 12 * (2 * k) - 4092 = 0\ndiscriminant : 12 ^ 2 - 4 * 3 * -4092 = 16384\nsqrt_discriminant : \u221a16384 = 128\n\u22a2 sorryAx (Sort ?u.10443) true\nunsolved goals\ncase intro\nn k : \u2115\nhk : n = k + k\nh\u2081 : 8 + (k * 2) ^ 2 * 3 = 12296\nh\u2082 : (2 * k - 2) ^ 2 + (2 * k) ^ 2 + (2 * k + 2) ^ 2 = 12296\nh\u2083 : 3 * (2 * k) ^ 2 + 12 * (2 * k) - 4092 = 0\nh\u2084 : k = 62\n\u22a2 False\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: linarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase intro.h1.h\nn k : \u2115\nhk : n = k + k\nh\u2081 : 8 + \u2191(k * 2) ^ 2 * 3 = 12296\na\u271d : (-(\u2191(k * 2) * 4) + \u2191(k * 2) ^ 3) / 8 < 32736\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, the problem states that we need to find the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of 1342 and, when divided by 13, leaves a remainder smaller than r, where r is the remainder when 1342 is divided by 13. The answer is supposed to be 6710. Let me see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to find r. So, let's compute 1342 divided by 13. Let me do that division. 13 times 100 is 1300, so 1342 minus 1300 is 42. Then, 13 times 3 is 39, so 42 minus 39 is 3. Therefore, the remainder r is 3. So, r = 3. That means we need a multiple of 1342 that, when divided by 13, leaves a remainder less than 3. Since remainders when dividing by 13 can be 0, 1, 2, ..., up to 12, \"smaller than 3\" would mean the remainder is 0, 1, or 2. But we need the smallest such multiple.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"smaller than r\", which is 3. So possible remainders are 0, 1, or 2. The smallest positive integer multiple of 1342 that, when divided by 13, leaves a remainder of 0, 1, or 2. But since 1342 itself leaves a remainder of 3, maybe adding multiples of 1342 and checking their remainders modulo 13.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as solving for the smallest k such that 1342k \u2261 s mod 13, where s is 0, 1, or 2. Then find the smallest k where this holds.\n\nBut first, let's note that 1342 mod 13 is 3, as we found. So 1342 \u2261 3 mod 13. Therefore, 1342k \u2261 3k mod 13. We need 3k \u2261 0, 1, or 2 mod 13. So we need to find the smallest k where 3k mod 13 is less than 3. Let's see.\n\nWe can approach this by solving 3k \u2261 t mod 13, where t \u2208 {0,1,2}, and find the smallest k \u22651 such that this holds. Then the corresponding number would be 1342k.\n\nLet's check for t=0 first. If 3k \u22610 mod13, then 13 divides 3k. Since 13 is prime and doesn't divide 3, it must divide k. So the smallest k here is 13, leading to 1342*13. But that's 1342*13=17,446. But maybe there's a smaller k for t=1 or t=2.\n\nCheck t=1: 3k \u22611 mod13. Multiply both sides by the modular inverse of 3 mod13. The inverse of 3 mod13 is 9 because 3*9=27\u22611 mod13. So k \u22619*1\u22619 mod13. So the smallest k here is 9. Then the number would be 1342*9=12,078. Let's check the remainder: 12,078 divided by 13. Let's compute 13*929=12,077. So 12,078 -12,077=1. So remainder 1. That's valid. So 12,078 is a candidate with remainder 1, which is less than 3.\n\nSimilarly, check t=2: 3k\u22612 mod13. Multiply both sides by 9 (the inverse of 3): k\u22619*2=18\u22615 mod13. So smallest k=5. Then the number is 1342*5=6,710. Let's check the remainder: 6,710 divided by 13. 13*516=6,708. So 6,710-6,708=2. Remainder 2. That's valid. So 6,710 is a multiple of 1342 and leaves remainder 2 when divided by 13, which is less than 3. Since 5 is smaller than 9 and 13, the smallest k is 5, leading to 6,710. Therefore, 6,710 is the answer.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. The problem says \"smallest positive integer that has these two properties: multiple of 1342 and remainder when divided by 13 is smaller than r (which is 3).\" So 6,710 is indeed a multiple of 1342 (since 1342*5=6,710) and when divided by 13 leaves remainder 2, which is less than 3. And since 5 is the smallest k that achieves this, 6,710 is the smallest such number. The earlier candidate for t=0 would be k=13, leading to 17,446, which is larger. Similarly, the t=1 case gives 12,078, which is larger than 6,710. Therefore, 6,710 is indeed the smallest.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nFirst, we determine the remainder \\( r \\) when \\( 1342 \\) is divided by \\( 13 \\). Calculating \\( 1342 \\div 13 \\), we find \\( 13 \\times 103 = 1339 \\), leaving a remainder of \\( 1342 - 1339 = 3 \\). Thus, \\( r = 3 \\). Our goal is to find the smallest multiple of \\( 1342 \\) that, when divided by \\( 13 \\), leaves a remainder **smaller than \\( 3 \\)** (i.e., \\( 0 \\), \\( 1 \\), or \\( 2 \\)).\n\nSince \\( 1342 \\equiv 3 \\mod 13 \\), any multiple \\( 1342k \\) satisfies \\( 1342k \\equiv 3k \\mod 13 \\). We need \\( 3k \\equiv t \\mod 13 \\), where \\( t \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\} \\). Let\u2019s analyze each case:\n\n1. **Case \\( t = 0 \\):**  \n   \\( 3k \\equiv 0 \\mod 13 \\) implies \\( k \\equiv 0 \\mod 13 \\). The smallest \\( k = 13 \\), giving \\( 1342 \\times 13 = 17,\\!446 \\).  \n   \n2. **Case \\( t = 1 \\):**  \n   Solve \\( 3k \\equiv 1 \\mod 13 \\). The modular inverse of \\( 3 \\mod 13 \\) is \\( 9 \\) (since \\( 3 \\times 9 = 27 \\equiv 1 \\mod 13 \\)). Thus, \\( k \\equiv 9 \\mod 13 \\). The smallest \\( k = 9 \\), giving \\( 1342 \\times 9 = 12,\\!078 \\).  \n   \n3. **Case \\( t = 2 \\):**  \n   Solve \\( 3k \\equiv 2 \\mod 13 \\). Multiplying by \\( 9 \\), \\( k \\equiv 18 \\equiv 5 \\mod 13 \\). The smallest \\( k = 5 \\), giving \\( 1342 \\times 5 = 6,\\!710 \\).  \n\nAmong these, \\( k = 5 \\) yields the smallest multiple \\( 6,\\!710 \\). Verifying, \\( 6,\\!710 \\div 13 = 516 \\) with remainder \\( 2 \\), which is indeed smaller than \\( r = 3 \\). Thus, \\( 6,\\!710 \\) is the smallest positive integer satisfying both conditions.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unsolved goals\nr n : \u2115\nh\u2080 : r = 1342 % 13\nh\u2081 : 0 < n\nh\u2082 : 1342 \u2223 n\nh\u2083 : n % 13 < r\nh\u2084 : r = 3\nh\u2085 : 1342 * 5 % 13 = 2\nh\u2086 : 1342 * 5 < 1342 * 6\n\u22a2 False\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase a\nr n : \u2115\nh\u2080 : r = 1342 % 13\nh\u2081 : 0 < n\nh\u2082 : 1342 \u2223 n\nh\u2083 : n % 13 < r\nh\u2084 : r = 3\nh\u2085 : 1342 * 5 % 13 = 2\nh\u2086 : 1342 * 5 < 1342 * 6\nh\u2087 : 1342 * 6 % 13 = 0\nh\u2081\u2080 : n % 1342 = 0\na\u271d : 6710 > n\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: no goals to be solved\nunsolved goals\nr n : \u2115\nh\u2080 : r = 1342 % 13\nh\u2081 : 0 < n\nh\u2082 : 1342 \u2223 n\nh\u2083 : n % 13 < r\nh\u2084 : r = 3\nh\u2085 : 1342 * 5 % 13 = 2\nh\u2086 : 1342 * 5 < 1342 * 6\n\u22a2 False\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase a\nr n : \u2115\nh\u2080 : r = 1342 % 13\nh\u2081 : 0 < n\nh\u2082 : 1342 \u2223 n\nh\u2083 : n % 13 < r\nh\u2084 : r = 3\nh\u2085 : 1342 * 5 % 13 = 2\nh\u2086 : 1342 * 5 < 1342 * 6\nh\u2087 : 1342 * 6 % 13 = 0\nh\u2088 : n % 1342 = 0\nh\u2089 : n % 13 < 3\na\u271d : 6710 > n\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: no goals to be solved\nunsolved goals\nr n : \u2115\nh\u2080 : r = 1342 % 13\nh\u2081 : 0 < n\nh\u2082 : 1342 \u2223 n\nh\u2083 : n % 13 < r\nh\u2084 : r = 3\nh\u2085 : 1342 * 5 % 13 = 2\nh\u2086 : 1342 * 5 < 1342 * 6\n\u22a2 False\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase a\nr n : \u2115\nh\u2080 : r = 1342 % 13\nh\u2081 : 0 < n\nh\u2082 : 1342 \u2223 n\nh\u2083 : n % 13 < r\nh\u2084 : r = 3\nh\u2085 : 1342 * 5 % 13 = 2\nh\u2086 : 1342 * 5 < 1342 * 6\nh\u2087 : 1342 * 6 % 13 = 0\nh\u2088 : n % 1342 = 0\nh\u2089 : n % 13 < 3\na\u271d : 6710 > n\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to show that the product from k=1 to n of (1 + 1/k\u00b3) is less than or equal to 3 - 1/n for any positive integer n. Hmm. Let me think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst, I remember that products can sometimes be tricky, but maybe there's a way to relate them to sums or use induction. The context given had a proof involving integrals and telescoping sums for a sum of reciprocals. Maybe that's a hint, but I'm not sure yet. Let me see.\n\nThe product here is (1 + 1/1\u00b3)(1 + 1/2\u00b3)(1 + 1/3\u00b3)...(1 + 1/n\u00b3). Each term is 1 + 1/k\u00b3. I need to show that when you multiply all these terms together, the result is at most 3 - 1/n. \n\nMaybe induction could work here. Let's try mathematical induction. For induction, I need to check the base case and then assume it's true for some n and show it holds for n+1.\n\nBase case: n=1. Then the product is just (1 + 1/1\u00b3) = 2. On the right-hand side, 3 - 1/1 = 2. So 2 \u2264 2, which holds. Good.\n\nAssume that for some n \u2265 1, the product up to n is \u2264 3 - 1/n. Now, for n+1, the product would be the previous product times (1 + 1/(n+1)\u00b3). So we need to show that [3 - 1/n] * [1 + 1/(n+1)\u00b3] \u2264 3 - 1/(n+1).\n\nHmm, let's compute the left-hand side: (3 - 1/n)(1 + 1/(n+1)^3). Let's expand this: 3*(1) + 3*(1/(n+1)^3) - (1/n)*(1) - (1/n)*(1/(n+1)^3). That's 3 + 3/(n+1)^3 - 1/n - 1/(n(n+1)^3). We need this to be \u2264 3 - 1/(n+1).\n\nSubtracting 3 from both sides, we need 3/(n+1)^3 - 1/n - 1/(n(n+1)^3) \u2264 -1/(n+1). Let's rearrange terms: 3/(n+1)^3 - 1/n - 1/(n(n+1)^3) + 1/(n+1) \u2264 0. Let's combine terms. Maybe factor out 1/(n+1)^3. Let's see:\n\nFirst term: 3/(n+1)^3\nSecond term: -1/n\nThird term: -1/(n(n+1)^3)\nFourth term: +1/(n+1)\n\nHmm, maybe combine the first and third terms: [3 - 1/n]/(n+1)^3. Then we have [3 - 1/n]/(n+1)^3 -1/n + 1/(n+1). Not sure. Alternatively, let's get a common denominator. This might get messy. Maybe there's a better approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe instead of induction, I can find an upper bound for each term in the product and then multiply those bounds. For example, maybe each term (1 + 1/k\u00b3) can be bounded by something that telescopes when multiplied. But how?\n\nWait, the context had an integral approach for a sum. Maybe integrating something here? But the problem is a product. Alternatively, taking logarithms to turn the product into a sum. Let's consider that. If I take the natural log of the product, it becomes the sum of ln(1 + 1/k\u00b3). Then, maybe I can bound this sum and exponentiate. But I'm not sure if that would lead me to 3 - 1/n. Maybe not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe expand the product. Let's see for small n. For n=1: 2. For n=2: (1 + 1)(1 + 1/8) = 2 * 9/8 = 9/4 = 2.25. The right-hand side is 3 - 1/2 = 2.5. So 2.25 \u2264 2.5, which holds. For n=3: 9/4 * (1 + 1/27) = 9/4 * 28/27 = (9*28)/(4*27) = (252)/(108) = 2.333..., and 3 - 1/3 \u2248 2.666..., so still holds. So the product seems to approach something less than 3. Maybe the upper bound is approaching 3 as n increases. But how to formalize this.\n\nWait, the right-hand side is 3 - 1/n. So as n increases, the upper bound approaches 3. Maybe the product converges to some limit less than 3, and 3 - 1/n is a decreasing sequence approaching 3 from below. Wait, no. 3 - 1/n approaches 3 as n approaches infinity. But the product might approach a limit less than 3. For example, the infinite product of (1 + 1/k\u00b3) from k=1 to infinity converges because the sum of 1/k\u00b3 converges. Let me check the approximate value. For k=1 to infinity, the product is (2)(1 + 1/8)(1 + 1/27)... which is 2 * 9/8 * 28/27 * 65/64 * ... Maybe this converges to a value around 2.5 or so. But the upper bound here is 3 - 1/n, which for large n is approaching 3. So maybe the product is always less than 3 - 1/n, which is less than 3. But how to show that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe compare each term (1 + 1/k\u00b3) to (1 + 1/(k(k+1))). Wait, the context had a sum involving 1/(k(k+1)), which telescopes. But here it's a product. Maybe there's a telescoping product. Let me think. If I can write each term as a ratio that telescopes when multiplied. For example, if (1 + 1/k\u00b3) = A_k / A_{k-1}, then the product would telescope to A_n / A_0. But I need to find such A_k. Alternatively, maybe use partial fractions or some identity.\n\nAlternatively, note that 1 + 1/k\u00b3 = (k\u00b3 + 1)/k\u00b3 = (k + 1)(k\u00b2 - k + 1)/k\u00b3. Because k\u00b3 + 1 factors as (k + 1)(k\u00b2 - k + 1). So each term becomes (k + 1)(k\u00b2 - k + 1)/k\u00b3. Then the product from k=1 to n would be product [(k + 1)(k\u00b2 - k + 1)/k\u00b3]. Let's split the product into two parts: product (k + 1)/k\u00b3 and product (k\u00b2 - k + 1). Wait, but that might not help directly. Let's see:\n\nProduct (k + 1)/k\u00b3 from k=1 to n is product (k + 1)/k^3 = product (k + 1)/k * 1/k\u00b2. The product (k + 1)/k from k=1 to n is (2/1)(3/2)(4/3)...(n+1)/n) = (n + 1)/1 = n + 1. Then the product of 1/k\u00b2 from k=1 to n is 1/(1^2 * 2^2 * ... * n^2) = 1/(n!)^2. Wait, but then the product (k + 1)/k\u00b3 becomes (n + 1)/(n!)^2. Then the other part is product (k\u00b2 - k + 1) from k=1 to n. Hmm, not sure if that helps. Let's compute that product. For k=1: 1\u00b2 -1 +1=1. For k=2: 4 -2 +1=3. For k=3:9 -3 +1=7. So the product is 1*3*7*...*(n\u00b2 -n +1). Not sure how to handle that. Maybe this approach isn't the way to go.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use induction but find a better way to handle the inductive step. Let's go back to induction. Suppose that the product up to n is P(n) \u2264 3 - 1/n. Then P(n+1) = P(n) * (1 + 1/(n+1)^3). We need to show that P(n) * (1 + 1/(n+1)^3) \u2264 3 - 1/(n+1). Using the inductive hypothesis, it's sufficient to show that (3 - 1/n)(1 + 1/(n+1)^3) \u2264 3 - 1/(n+1). Let's compute the left-hand side:\n\n(3 - 1/n)(1 + 1/(n+1)^3) = 3*(1) + 3/(n+1)^3 - 1/n*(1) - 1/(n(n+1)^3) = 3 + 3/(n+1)^3 - 1/n - 1/(n(n+1)^3).\n\nWe need this to be \u2264 3 - 1/(n+1). Subtract 3 from both sides:\n\n3/(n+1)^3 - 1/n - 1/(n(n+1)^3) \u2264 -1/(n+1).\n\nMultiply both sides by -1 (which reverses the inequality):\n\n-3/(n+1)^3 + 1/n + 1/(n(n+1)^3) \u2265 1/(n+1).\n\nLet's combine terms:\n\n1/n + [ -3/(n+1)^3 + 1/(n(n+1)^3) ] \u2265 1/(n+1).\n\nFactor out 1/(n+1)^3 from the bracketed terms:\n\n1/n + [ (-3 + 1/n) / (n+1)^3 ] \u2265 1/(n+1).\n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Maybe rearrange the original inequality:\n\n3/(n+1)^3 - 1/n - 1/(n(n+1)^3) + 1/(n+1) \u2264 0.\n\nCombine the terms:\n\n[3/(n+1)^3 + 1/(n+1)] - [1/n + 1/(n(n+1)^3)] \u2264 0.\n\nLet me compute each part:\n\nFirst part: 3/(n+1)^3 + 1/(n+1) = 1/(n+1) [3/(n+1)^2 + 1].\n\nSecond part: 1/n + 1/(n(n+1)^3) = 1/n [1 + 1/(n+1)^3].\n\nSo the inequality becomes:\n\n1/(n+1) [3/(n+1)^2 + 1] - 1/n [1 + 1/(n+1)^3] \u2264 0.\n\nLet's factor out 1/(n(n+1)):\n\n[1/(n(n+1))] [n(3/(n+1)^2 + 1) - (n+1)(1 + 1/(n+1)^3)] \u2264 0.\n\nNow compute the expression inside the brackets:\n\nn(3/(n+1)^2 + 1) - (n+1)(1 + 1/(n+1)^3).\n\nExpand each term:\n\nn*3/(n+1)^2 + n*1 - (n+1)*1 - (n+1)/(n+1)^3.\n\nSimplify:\n\n3n/(n+1)^2 + n - (n+1) - 1/(n+1)^2.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n3n/(n+1)^2 - 1/(n+1)^2 + n - (n+1).\n\nWhich is:\n\n(3n -1)/(n+1)^2 + (n - n -1) = (3n -1)/(n+1)^2 -1.\n\nSo the entire expression becomes:\n\n[ (3n -1)/(n+1)^2 -1 ] * 1/(n(n+1)) \u2264 0.\n\nSince 1/(n(n+1)) is positive for n \u22651, the inequality reduces to:\n\n(3n -1)/(n+1)^2 -1 \u2264 0.\n\nCompute this:\n\n(3n -1)/(n+1)^2 -1 = [3n -1 - (n+1)^2]/(n+1)^2.\n\nExpand (n+1)^2 = n\u00b2 + 2n +1.\n\nSo numerator: 3n -1 -n\u00b2 -2n -1 = -n\u00b2 +n -2.\n\nThus, the expression is (-n\u00b2 +n -2)/(n+1)^2 \u22640.\n\nSince the denominator is always positive, the sign is determined by the numerator: -n\u00b2 +n -2.\n\nFor n \u22651, let's check the numerator:\n\n-n\u00b2 +n -2. For n=1: -1 +1 -2 = -2 <0.\n\nFor n=2: -4 +2 -2 = -4 <0.\n\nFor n=3: -9 +3 -2 = -8 <0.\n\nAnd in general, for n \u22651, -n\u00b2 +n -2 is always negative because n\u00b2 grows faster than n. Therefore, the entire expression is negative, so the inequality holds. Therefore, the original inductive step holds. Hence, by mathematical induction, the inequality holds for all positive integers n.\n\nWait, so this shows that (3 -1/n)(1 +1/(n+1)^3) \u22643 -1/(n+1). Therefore, the induction step works. Therefore, the inequality holds for all n. So the induction works. Therefore, the proof is complete.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another approach, but induction seems to work here. Let me check for n=2 again. The product is 2*(9/8)=9/4=2.25. The right-hand side is 3 -1/2=2.5. So 2.25 \u22642.5, which holds. For n=3: 9/4 *28/27= (9*28)/(4*27)= (252)/(108)=2.333..., and 3 -1/3\u22482.666..., which holds. So the inductive step works here.\n\nTherefore, the induction approach is valid. So the proof is by induction, with the base case n=1, and the inductive step showing that if it holds for n, it holds for n+1 by bounding the product appropriately.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nWe'll use mathematical induction to prove that for any positive integer \\( n \\), the product \\( \\prod_{k=1}^n \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{k^3}\\right) \\) is bounded above by \\( 3 - \\frac{1}{n} \\).\n\n**Base Case (\\( n = 1 \\)):**  \nFor \\( n = 1 \\), the product is \\( 1 + \\frac{1}{1^3} = 2 \\).

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is asking for the units digit of the product of all the odd integers between 0 and 12. And we need to show that it's 5. Hmm. Alright, first, I need to list out all the odd integers between 0 and 12. Let's start there.\n\nSo, the numbers between 0 and 12 are 1, 2, 3, ..., 11. But we need only the odd ones. That would be 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11. Right? Let me check: 1 is odd, 3 is odd, 5, 7, 9, 11. Yeah, those are all the odd numbers between 0 and 12. So the product we're looking at is 1 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 11.\n\nNow, the question is about the units digit of this product. The units digit is the last digit of the number when written in base 10. So, for example, if the product ends with a 5, then the units digit is 5. The problem states that it is 5, so we need to confirm that.\n\nBut how do we find the units digit of such a product without calculating the entire product? Calculating the entire product might be tedious, especially since 1\u00d73\u00d75\u00d77\u00d79\u00d711 is... let's see. Let's compute it step by step. 1\u00d73=3, 3\u00d75=15, 15\u00d77=105, 105\u00d79=945, 945\u00d711=10395. So the product is 10395, and the units digit is 5. That matches the problem's assertion. But the problem wants us to show that it's 5, not just compute it directly. So maybe there's a smarter way to see why the units digit is 5 without multiplying all the numbers.\n\nLooking at the context provided, there's an example about divisors modulo 12. The example shows that 5 \u00d7 1 \u2261 5 mod 12 and 7 \u00d7 11 \u2261 5 mod 12. Wait, maybe that's relevant here. The problem is about modulo 10, since we're interested in the units digit, which is equivalent to the number modulo 10. But the context example is modulo 12. Hmm. Maybe there's a connection in terms of multiplicative inverses or properties of odd numbers modulo certain numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key insight is that among the odd numbers being multiplied, there's a 5. Since 5 is a factor, and when you multiply 5 by any odd number, the product will end with 5 or 0. But wait, all the numbers here are odd, so multiplying 5 by another odd number would give a units digit of 5. For example, 5\u00d71=5, 5\u00d73=15, 5\u00d75=25, 5\u00d77=35, 5\u00d79=45, 5\u00d711=55. All these end with 5. So if there's a 5 in the factors, and all other factors are odd, then the product will end with 5. Because multiplying 5 by any odd number gives a units digit of 5, and subsequent multiplications by odd numbers would maintain that. Let's test this.\n\nSuppose we have 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 (units digit 5). Then 15 \u00d7 7 = 105 (units digit 5). Then 105 \u00d7 9 = 945 (units digit 5). Then 945 \u00d7 11 = 10395 (units digit 5). So each time, multiplying by an odd number keeps the units digit as 5. That seems to hold. So the presence of 5 in the factors ensures that the product will end with 5, given that all other factors are odd. Because 5 \u00d7 odd = ...5, and then multiplying by another odd number would be ...5 \u00d7 odd, which again ends with 5. Let's check with smaller examples. Like 5 \u00d7 1 = 5. 5 \u00d7 3 = 15. 15 \u00d7 5 = 75. 75 \u00d7 7 = 525. Each time, the units digit remains 5. So this pattern holds.\n\nTherefore, the key reason the units digit is 5 is because the product includes the number 5 and all other factors are odd. This combination ensures that the units digit of the product is 5. Additionally, since we're multiplying by 1, which doesn't change the product, but it's included in the list of odd numbers between 0 and 12. So the presence of 5 is crucial here. If there were no 5, the units digit might be different. For example, if we multiply 1 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 11, let's see: 1\u00d73=3, 3\u00d77=21, 21\u00d79=189, 189\u00d711=2079. The units digit here is 9. So indeed, including 5 changes the units digit to 5.\n\nAnother way to think about it is modulo 10. The units digit of a number is equivalent to the number modulo 10. So we can compute the product modulo 10. Let's do that step by step. The product is 1 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 11. Let's compute this modulo 10.\n\n1 mod 10 = 1\n\n1 \u00d7 3 = 3 mod 10 = 3\n\n3 \u00d7 5 = 15 mod 10 = 5\n\n5 \u00d7 7 = 35 mod 10 = 5\n\n5 \u00d7 9 = 45 mod 10 = 5\n\n5 \u00d7 11 = 55 mod 10 = 5\n\nSo at each step, after multiplying by 5, the result modulo 10 remains 5. Therefore, the final product modulo 10 is 5, which means the units digit is 5. This aligns with our earlier reasoning.\n\nSo the core idea is that once you multiply by 5, and since all subsequent factors are odd, the units digit remains 5. This is because multiplying 5 (which is 5 mod 10) by any odd number (which is 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9 mod 10) will result in a number that ends with 5. For example:\n\n5 \u00d7 1 = 5 \u2192 5 mod 10\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5 mod 10\n\n5 \u00d7 5 = 25 \u2192 5 mod 10\n\n5 \u00d7 7 = 35 \u2192 5 mod 10\n\n5 \u00d7 9 = 45 \u2192 5 mod 10\n\n5 \u00d7 11 = 55 \u2192 5 mod 10\n\nEach time, the product modulo 10 is 5. Therefore, once 5 is included in the product, the units digit is fixed at 5, regardless of the other odd factors. This explains why the units digit of the product of all odd integers between 0 and 12 is indeed 5.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo determine the units digit of the product of all odd integers between 0 and 12, we first list these numbers: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11. The product is \\(1 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times 7 \\times 9 \\times 11\\). The key observation is that **the presence of 5 in the factors guarantees the units digit will be 5**, provided all other factors are odd. Here's why:\n\n1. **Effect of multiplying by 5**:  \n   When 5 is multiplied by any odd integer, the units digit of the result is always 5. For example:\n   - \\(5 \\times 1 = 5\\) (units digit 5)\n   - \\(5 \\times 3 = 15\\) (units digit 5)\n   - \\(5 \\times 7 = 35\\) (units digit 5)\n   - This pattern holds because \\(5 \\times \\text{odd} \\equiv 5 \\pmod{10}\\).\n\n2. **Subsequent multiplications by odd numbers**:  \n   After introducing 5 into the product, multiplying by additional odd numbers preserves the units digit of 5. For instance:\n   - \\(15 \\times 7 = 105\\) (units digit 5)\n   - \\(105 \\times 9 = 945\\) (units digit 5)\n   - \\(945 \\times 11 = 10395\\) (units digit 5)\n   Each multiplication by an odd number maintains the units digit at 5.\n\n3. **Modulo 10 simplification**:  \n   The units digit of a number is equivalent to its remainder when divided by 10. Calculating the product modulo 10 step-by-step:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{align*}\n   1 \\times 3 &\\equiv 3 \\pmod{10}, \\\\\n   3 \\times 5 &\\equiv 15 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{10}, \\\\\n   5 \\times 7 &\\equiv 35 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{10}, \\\\\n   5 \\times 9 &\\equiv 45 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{10}, \\\\\n   5 \\times 11 &\\equiv 55 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{10}.\n   \\end{align*}\n   \\]\n   At every step after introducing 5, the result modulo 10 remains 5.\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nSince the product includes 5 and all other factors are odd, the units digit of the final product is guaranteed to be 5. This aligns with the computed result \\(1 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times 7 \\times 9 \\times 11 = 10395\\), whose units digit is indeed 5.\nPrevious attempt failed with: The rfl tactic failed.

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to find b^a given that 2^a = 32 and a^b = 125, and show that it's 243. Hmm. Alright, first step is probably to find the value of a from the first equation. Since 2^a = 32, and I know that 2^5 is 32 because 2*2*2*2*2 is 32. So a must be 5. That seems straightforward.\n\nNow, with a = 5, the second equation is a^b = 125. So that's 5^b = 125. I need to find b here. Let's think. 5 cubed is 125 because 5*5 is 25, times 5 again is 125. So b would be 3.\n\nThen, the problem asks for b^a. Since b is 3 and a is 5, that's 3^5. Let me calculate that. 3^5 is 3*3*3*3*3. 3*3 is 9, times 3 is 27, times 3 is 81, times 3 is 243. So 3^5 equals 243. That matches what the problem says to show. \n\nWait, but maybe I should check if there's another way to approach this, just to be sure. Let's verify each step again. Starting with 2^a = 32. 2^5 is definitely 32. So a=5. Then 5^b =125. 5^3 is 125. So b=3. Then 3^5 is 243. Yep, that all checks out. \n\nIs there any chance I made a mistake in the exponents? Let me confirm. For example, if a was something else, but no, 2^5 is 32. And 5^3 is 125. So the steps are correct. Therefore, the final answer is 243. I think that's all there is to it. The problem seems straightforward once you solve for a and b step by step.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nFirst, we start with the equation \\(2^a = 32\\).

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The question says that the product of three consecutive positive integers is 8 times their sum. We need to find the sum of their squares, and the answer is supposed to be 77. Let me think through how to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's define the three consecutive integers. Since they are consecutive, we can represent them as n, n+1, and n+2 where n is a positive integer. That makes sense because consecutive integers differ by 1.\n\nThe problem states that their product equals 8 times their sum. So, mathematically, that would be:\n\nn(n+1)(n+2) = 8(n + (n+1) + (n+2))\n\nLet me write that out. The left side is the product, and the right side is 8 times the sum. Let's simplify both sides to solve for n.\n\nFirst, simplify the sum on the right side. Adding n, n+1, and n+2 gives:\n\nn + (n+1) + (n+2) = 3n + 3 = 3(n + 1)\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\nn(n+1)(n+2) = 8 * 3(n + 1) = 24(n + 1)\n\nHmm, so we have n(n+1)(n+2) = 24(n + 1). Wait, both sides have a factor of (n + 1). Since n is a positive integer, n + 1 can't be zero, so we can divide both sides by (n + 1) to simplify. Let's do that:\n\nDivide both sides by (n + 1):\n\nn(n+2) = 24\n\nSo now the equation is n(n + 2) = 24. Let's expand the left side:\n\nn\u00b2 + 2n = 24\n\nSubtract 24 from both sides to set the equation to zero:\n\nn\u00b2 + 2n - 24 = 0\n\nNow we have a quadratic equation. Let's try to factor it. Looking for two numbers that multiply to -24 and add up to 2. Let's see: 6 and -4? 6 * (-4) = -24, and 6 + (-4) = 2. Yes, that works. So the equation factors as:\n\n(n + 6)(n - 4) = 0\n\nSetting each factor equal to zero gives n = -6 or n = 4. But since n is a positive integer, we discard n = -6. So n = 4.\n\nTherefore, the three consecutive integers are 4, 5, and 6. Now, we need to find the sum of their squares. Let's compute that:\n\n4\u00b2 + 5\u00b2 + 6\u00b2 = 16 + 25 + 36 = 16 + 25 is 41, plus 36 is 77. So the sum is 77, which corresponds to option B.\n\nWait, let me double-check the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the product equals 8 times the sum. Defined variables correctly. Simplified the sum correctly to 3n + 3. Then divided both sides by (n + 1) after factoring, leading to n(n + 2) = 24. Solved the quadratic correctly, found n = 4. Then calculated the squares: 16 + 25 + 36. Yes, that adds up to 77. Everything checks out. The answer should be B) 77.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nLet's start by defining the three consecutive positive integers. Since they are consecutive, we can represent them as \\( n \\), \\( n+1 \\), and \\( n+2 \\), where \\( n \\) is a positive integer. The problem states that their product equals 8 times their sum. This gives us the equation:\n\n\\[\nn(n+1)(n+2) = 8 \\cdot \\big(n + (n+1) + (n+2)\\big).\n\\]\n\nFirst, simplify the sum on the right side:\n\\[\nn + (n+1) + (n+2) = 3n + 3 = 3(n + 1).\n\\]\n\nSubstitute this back into the original equation:\n\\[\nn(n+1)(n+2) = 8 \\cdot 3(n + 1) = 24(n + 1).\n\\]\n\nNotice that both sides of the equation share a common factor of \\( n + 1 \\). Since \\( n \\) is positive, \\( n + 1 \\neq 0 \\), so we can safely divide both sides by \\( n + 1 \\):\n\\[\nn(n+2) = 24.\n\\]\n\nExpanding the left side gives:\n\\[\nn^2 + 2n = 24.\n\\]\n\nRearranging into standard quadratic form:\n\\[\nn^2 + 2n - 24 = 0.\n\\]\n\nFactoring the quadratic equation:\n\\[\n(n + 6)(n - 4) = 0.\n\\]\n\nThis yields solutions \\( n = -6 \\) or \\( n = 4 \\). Since \\( n \\) must be positive, we discard \\( n = -6 \\) and take \\( n = 4 \\). The three consecutive integers are \\( 4 \\), \\( 5 \\), and \\( 6 \\).\n\nFinally, compute the sum of their squares:\n\\[\n4^2 + 5^2 + 6^2 = 16 + 25 + 36 = 77.\n\\]\n\nThus, the sum of their squares is \\( \\boxed{77} \\), corresponding to option \\( \\mathrm{(B)} \\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: type mismatch\n  h\u2083\nhas type\n  a * (a + 1) * (b + 1) = 8 * (a + (a + 1) + (b + 1)) : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  a * (a + 1) * (a + 2) = 8 * (a + (a + 1) + (a + 2)) : Prop\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  ?a + ?b + ?c\na b c : \u2115\nh\u2080 : 0 < a \u2227 0 < b \u2227 0 < c\nh\u2081 : b = a + 1\nh\u2082 : c = b + 1\nh\u2083 : a * b * c = 8 * (a + b + c)\nh\u2084 : a * (a + 1) * (a + 2) = 8 * (a + (a + 1) + (a + 2))\n\u22a2 a * (a + 1) * (a + 2) = 8 * (3 * a + 3)\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  ?a * 1\na b c : \u2115\nh\u2080 : 0 < a \u2227 0 < b \u2227 0 < c\nh\u2081 : b = a + 1\nh\u2082 : c = b + 1\nh\u2083 : a * b * c = 8 * (a + b + c)\nh\u2084 : a * (a + 1) * (a + 2) = 8 * (a + (a + 1) + (a + 2))\nh\u2085 : a * (a + 1) * a + a * (a + 1) * 2 = 8 * (3 * a + 3)\n\u22a2 a * (a + 1) * (a + 2) = 24 * (a + 1)\napplication type mismatch\n  mul_right_cancel\u2080 ?m.6719 h\u2086\nargument\n  h\u2086\nhas type\n  (a + 2) * (a * (a + 1)) = 24 * (a + 1) : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  a * (a + 2) * ?m.4718 = 24 * ?m.4718 : Prop\nunsolved goals\na b c : \u2115\nh\u2080 : 0 < a \u2227 0 < b \u2227 0 < c\nh\u2081 : b = a + 1\nh\u2082 : c = b + 1\nh\u2083 : a * b * c = 8 * (a + b + c)\nh\u2084 : a * (a + 1) * (a + 2) = 8 * (a + (a + 1) + (a + 2))\nh\u2085 : a * (a + 1) * (a + 2) = 8 * (3 * a + 3)\nh\u2086 : (a + 2) * (a * (a + 1)) = 24 * (a + 1)\n\u22a2 \u00ac?m.4718 = 0\ntype mismatch\n  h\u2087\nhas type\n  (a + 2) * a = 24 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  a ^ 2 + 2 * a - 24 = 0 : Prop\ntype mismatch\n  h\u2081\u2083\nhas type\n  4 ^ 2 + (5 ^ 2 + 6 ^ 2) = 77 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  a ^ 2 + (b ^ 2 + c ^ 2) = 77 : Prop\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: type mismatch\n  h\u2083\nhas type\n  a * (a + 1) * (b + 1) = 8 * (a + (a + 1) + (b + 1)) : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  a * (a + 1) * (a + 2) = 8 * (a + (a + 1) + (a + 2)) : Prop\ntype mismatch\n  h\u2084\nhas type\n  a * (a + 1) * (a + 2) = 8 * (a + (a + (1 + (a + 2)))) : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  a * (a + 1) * (a + 2) = 8 * (3 * a + 3) : Prop\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  (a + 1) * (a + 2)\na b c : \u2115\nh\u2080 : 0 < a \u2227 0 < b \u2227 0 < c\nh\u2081 : b = a + 1\nh\u2082 : c = b + 1\nh\u2083 : a * b * c = 8 * (a + b + c)\nh\u2084 : a * (a + 1) * (a + 2) = 8 * (a + (a + 1) + (a + 2))\nh\u2085 : a * (a + 1) * (a + 2) = 8 * (3 * a + 3)\n\u22a2 a * (a + 2) * (a + 1) = 24 * (a + 1)\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  (a + 1) * (a + 2)\na b c : \u2115\nh\u2080 : 0 < a \u2227 0 < b \u2227 0 < c\nh\u2081 : b = a + 1\nh\u2082 : c = b + 1\nh\u2083 : a * b * c = 8 * (a + b + c)\nh\u2084 : a * (a + 1) * (a + 2) = 8 * (a + (a + 1) + (a + 2))\nh\u2085 : a * (a + 1) * (a + 2) = 8 * (3 * a + 3)\nh\u2086 : a * (a + 2) * (a + 1) = 24 * (a + 1)\n\u22a2 a * (a + 2) = 24\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  (a + 2) * a\na b c : \u2115\nh\u2080 : 0 < a \u2227 0 < b \u2227 0 < c\nh\u2081 : b = a + 1\nh\u2082 : c = b + 1\nh\u2083 : a * b * c = 8 * (a + b + c)\nh\u2084 : a * (a + 1) * (a + 2) = 8 * (a + (a + 1) + (a + 2))\nh\u2085 : a * (a + 1) * (a + 2) = 8 * (3 * a + 3)\nh\u2086 : a * (a + 2) * (a + 1) = 24 * (a + 1)\nh\u2087 : a * (a + 2) = 24\n\u22a2 a ^ 2 + 2 * a - 24 = 0\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to solve the equation (x - 9)/(x + 1) = 2 for x, and show that the solution is x = -11. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an equation with a fraction equal to a number, you can start by getting rid of the denominator. To do that, I can multiply both sides of the equation by the denominator, which in this case is (x + 1). That should help eliminate the fraction.\n\nSo, multiplying both sides by (x + 1) gives me (x - 9) = 2*(x + 1). Wait, let me check that. Yes, because if I have (x-9)/(x+1) = 2, multiplying both sides by (x+1) cancels out the denominator on the left, leaving x - 9, and the right side becomes 2*(x + 1). That makes sense.\n\nNow, I need to solve for x. Let's expand the right side first. 2*(x + 1) is 2x + 2. So the equation becomes x - 9 = 2x + 2. \n\nNext, I want to get all the x terms on one side and the constants on the other. Let me subtract x from both sides. That would give me -9 = x + 2. Then, subtract 2 from both sides to isolate x. So, -9 - 2 = x, which simplifies to x = -11. \n\nWait, but I should check if this solution is valid. Sometimes when you multiply both sides by a variable expression, you might introduce an extraneous solution if that expression was zero. So, I need to make sure that the denominator (x + 1) isn't zero when x = -11. Plugging x = -11 into (x + 1) gives (-11) + 1 = -10, which is not zero. So, the solution x = -11 is valid. \n\nLet me verify the solution by plugging it back into the original equation. Left side: (-11 - 9)/(-11 + 1) = (-20)/(-10) = 2. Right side is 2. So both sides equal 2, which confirms that x = -11 is indeed the correct solution.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo solve the equation \\(\\frac{x - 9}{x + 1} = 2\\) for \\(x\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Eliminate the denominator**: Multiply both sides of the equation by \\((x + 1)\\) to remove the fraction:\n   \\[\n   (x - 9) = 2(x + 1).\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Expand the right side**: Distribute the 2 into \\((x + 1)\\):\n   \\[\n   x - 9 = 2x + 2.\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Isolate \\(x\\)**:\n   - Subtract \\(x\\) from both sides:\n     \\[\n     -9 = x + 2.\n     \\]\n   - Subtract 2 from both sides:\n     \\[\n     x = -11.\n     \\]\n   \n4. **Verify validity**: Check that \\(x = -11\\) does not make the original denominator zero:\n   \\[\n   x + 1 = -11 + 1 = -10 \\neq 0.\n   \\]\n   \n5. **Confirm the solution**: Substitute \\(x = -11\\) back into the original equation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{-11 - 9}{-11 + 1} = \\frac{-20}{-10} = 2,\n   \\]\n   which matches the right-hand side of the equation.

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the least positive integer n such that 80325 divides n!. The answer is supposed to be 17, but I need to figure out why. Let me start by understanding what the problem is asking. \n\nFirst, n! means the factorial of n, which is the product of all positive integers up to n. So, 17! would be 1\u00d72\u00d73\u00d7...\u00d717. The question is asking for the smallest n where 80325 is a divisor of n!. That means when you divide n! by 80325, there's no remainder. \n\nBut how do I approach this? I remember that to check if a number divides a factorial, we need to look at the prime factors of that number and ensure that the factorial contains all those prime factors with at least the required exponents. So maybe I should start by factoring 80325 into its prime components.\n\nLet me factorize 80325. Let's see, 80325. Let's divide by small primes. First, check if it's even. 80325 ends with a 5, so it's divisible by 5. Dividing by 5 gives 80325 \u00f7 5 = 16065. That's still ending with 5, so divide by 5 again: 16065 \u00f75 = 3213. Now, 3213. Let's check divisibility by 3. The sum of digits is 3+2+1+3=9, which is divisible by 3. So 3213 \u00f73 = 1071. Again, sum of digits is 1+0+7+1=9, so divide by 3 again: 1071 \u00f73=357. Sum of digits 3+5+7=15, divisible by 3: 357 \u00f73=119. Now 119. Let's check: 119 \u00f77=17. So 119=7\u00d717. So putting it all together, the prime factors of 80325 are 5\u00b2 \u00d73\u00b3 \u00d77 \u00d717. \n\nSo 80325 = 5\u00b2 \u00d73\u00b3 \u00d77\u00b9 \u00d717\u00b9. Therefore, for n! to be divisible by 80325, n! must have at least two 5s, three 3s, one 7, and one 17 in its prime factorization. \n\nNow, the key is to find the smallest n such that n! contains each of these prime factors with exponents at least as much as in 80325. The highest prime here is 17, so n has to be at least 17 because 17 is a prime factor. But maybe even higher? Wait, but the answer is supposed to be 17, so let's check if 17! has enough of each prime factor.\n\nLet's check each prime:\n\n1. For 17: Since 17 is a prime, it first appears in 17!. So 17! has exactly one 17. The required exponent is 1, so that's satisfied.\n\n2. For 7: The exponent of 7 in 17! is calculated by floor(17/7) + floor(17/49) + ... = 2 + 0 = 2. Since 49 is larger than 17, we stop there. So exponent of 7 is 2, which is more than the required 1. Good.\n\n3. For 3: The exponent of 3 in 17! is floor(17/3) + floor(17/9) + floor(17/27) + ... = 5 + 1 + 0 = 6. We need at least 3, so 6 is sufficient.\n\n4. For 5: The exponent of 5 in 17! is floor(17/5) + floor(17/25) + ... = 3 + 0 = 3. We need at least 2, so 3 is enough.\n\nSo all exponents in 17! meet or exceed those required by 80325. Therefore, 17! is divisible by 80325. But we need to check if a smaller n would work. Let's check n=16.\n\nFor n=16:\n\n- 17 is not a factor of 16!, so 16! doesn't have 17. Hence, 16! cannot be divisible by 80325, which requires 17 as a factor. Therefore, 16 is too small.\n\nThus, the smallest n is 17.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo determine the least positive integer \\( n \\) such that \\( 80325 \\) divides \\( n! \\), we first factorize \\( 80325 \\) into its prime components.

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. We need to maximize the expression A\u00b7M\u00b7C + A\u00b7M + M\u00b7C + A\u00b7C, given that A, M, and C are nonnegative integers adding up to 12. The answer choices suggest the maximum is 112, which is option E. Let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I notice that the expression can be factored. Let me check: A\u00b7M\u00b7C + A\u00b7M + M\u00b7C + A\u00b7C. Hmm, if I add 1 to each term, maybe? Wait, let's see. Let's factor:\n\nA\u00b7M\u00b7C + A\u00b7M + M\u00b7C + A\u00b7C = A\u00b7M\u00b7C + AM + MC + AC. Maybe factor terms. Let's factor AM out of the first two terms: AM(C + 1) + C(A + M). Not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe think of the expression as (A + 1)(M + 1)(C + 1) minus something. Let's expand (A+1)(M+1)(C+1):\n\nThat would be AMC + AM + AC + MC + A + M + C + 1. Comparing to our original expression, which is AMC + AM + AC + MC. So the difference is (A + M + C + 1). Since A + M + C = 12, the original expression is equal to (A+1)(M+1)(C+1) - (12 + 1) = (A+1)(M+1)(C+1) - 13.\n\nSo maximizing the original expression is equivalent to maximizing (A+1)(M+1)(C+1), then subtracting 13. Therefore, the problem reduces to maximizing the product (A+1)(M+1)(C+1) given A + M + C = 12.\n\nNow, the maximum product of three numbers with a fixed sum occurs when the numbers are as equal as possible. This is the AM-GM inequality idea. But here, the variables are A+1, M+1, C+1, and their sum is (A + M + C) + 3 = 15. So we need to maximize the product of three numbers that add up to 15. The maximum product is when they are equal, so 15/3 = 5. So 5\u00d75\u00d75=125. But since A, M, C are nonnegative integers, their adjusted values (A+1, etc.) must be integers at least 1. So we need three integers adding to 15, as close to 5 as possible.\n\nPossible distributions: 5,5,5. But that would mean A=4, M=4, C=4. Their sum is 12. Perfect! So (4+1)(4+1)(4+1)=125. Then the original expression is 125 -13=112. That's option E. So that's the maximum.\n\nWait, but let me check if there are other distributions that might give a higher product. For example, if the numbers are 6,6,3. Their product is 6\u00d76\u00d73=108. Then 108 -13=95, which is less than 112. Or 7,5,3: product 105, 105-13=92. Or 4,5,6: product 120, 120-13=107. Still less than 112. So the maximum is indeed when all three are 5, leading to 125-13=112. Therefore, the answer is E.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo maximize the expression \\( A \\cdot M \\cdot C + A \\cdot M + M \\cdot C + A \\cdot C \\) under the constraint \\( A + M + C = 12 \\), we can rewrite the expression in a more manageable form. Notice that:\n\n\\[\nA \\cdot M \\cdot C + A \\cdot M + M \\cdot C + A \\cdot C = (A + 1)(M + 1)(C + 1) - (A + M + C + 1).\n\\]\n\nSince \\( A + M + C = 12 \\), this simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n(A + 1)(M + 1)(C + 1) - 13.\n\\]\n\nThus, maximizing the original expression is equivalent to maximizing \\( (A + 1)(M + 1)(C + 1) \\). The sum \\( (A + 1) + (M + 1) + (C + 1) = 15 \\), so we need three integers (each at least 1) that add to 15 and have the largest possible product. By the arithmetic mean-geometric mean inequality, the product is maximized when the terms are as equal as possible. The closest integers are \\( 5, 5, 5 \\), yielding:\n\n\\[\n5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 125.\n\\]\n\nThis corresponds to \\( A = 4 \\), \\( M = 4 \\), \\( C = 4 \\), since \\( A + 1 = 5 \\), etc. Substituting back, the original expression becomes:\n\n\\[\n125 - 13 = 112.\n\\]\n\nOther distributions (e.g., \\( 6, 6, 3 \\)) produce smaller products (e.g., \\( 6 \\times 6 \\times 3 = 108 \\)), leading to values like \\( 108 - 13 = 95 \\), which are less than 112. Thus, the maximum value is **112**, corresponding to option **E**.\nPrevious attempt failed with: linarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase h\u2081.h\u2081.a\na m c : \u2115\nh\u2080 : a + m + c = 12\nh\u2081 : (a + 1) * (m + 1) * (c + 1) = a * m * c + a * m + m * c + a * c + a + m + c + 1\nh\u2083 : a + m + c = 12\nh\u2084 : a + m + c + 3 = 15\nh\u2085 : a + 1 + (m + 1) + (c + 1) = 15\na\u271d : a + 1 > 5\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase h\u2081.h\u2082.a\na m c : \u2115\nh\u2080 : a + m + c = 12\nh\u2081 : (a + 1) * (m + 1) * (c + 1) = a * m * c + a * m + m * c + a * c + a + m + c + 1\nh\u2083 : a + m + c = 12\nh\u2084 : a + m + c + 3 = 15\nh\u2085 : a + 1 + (m + 1) + (c + 1) = 15\na\u271d : m + 1 > 5\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase h\u2082.a\na m c : \u2115\nh\u2080 : a + m + c = 12\nh\u2081 : (a + 1) * (m + 1) * (c + 1) = a * m * c + a * m + m * c + a * c + a + m + c + 1\nh\u2083 : a + m + c = 12\nh\u2084 : a + m + c + 3 = 15\nh\u2085 : a + 1 + (m + 1) + (c + 1) = 15\na\u271d : c + 1 > 5\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nunsolved goals\ncase h\u2081.h\u2081\na m c : \u2115\nh\u2080 : a + m + c = 12\nh\u2081 : (a + 1) * (m + 1) * (c + 1) = a * m * c + a * m + m * c + a * c + a + m + c + 1\nh\u2083 : a + m + c = 12\nh\u2084 : a + m + c + 3 = 15\nh\u2085 : a + 1 + (m + 1) + (c + 1) = 15\n\u22a2 a + 1 \u2264 5\n\ncase h\u2081.h\u2082\na m c : \u2115\nh\u2080 : a + m + c = 12\nh\u2081 : (a + 1) * (m + 1) * (c + 1) = a * m * c + a * m + m * c + a * c + a + m + c + 1\nh\u2083 : a + m + c = 12\nh\u2084 : a + m + c + 3 = 15\nh\u2085 : a + 1 + (m + 1) + (c + 1) = 15\n\u22a2 m + 1 \u2264 5\n\ncase h\u2082\na m c : \u2115\nh\u2080 : a + m + c = 12\nh\u2081 : (a + 1) * (m + 1) * (c + 1) = a * m * c + a * m + m * c + a * c + a + m + c + 1\nh\u2083 : a + m + c = 12\nh\u2084 : a + m + c + 3 = 15\nh\u2085 : a + 1 + (m + 1) + (c + 1) = 15\n\u22a2 c + 1 \u2264 5\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unsolved goals\na m c : \u2115\nh\u2080 : a + m + c = 12\nh\u2081 : (a + 1) * (m + 1) * (c + 1) = a * m * c + a * m + m * c + a * c + a + m + c + 1\n\u22a2 1 + a + a * m + a * m * c + a * c + m + m * c + c - (1 + a + m + c) = a * m + a * m * c + a * c + m * c\nunknown constant 'Nat.le_of_eq_or_lt'\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unsolved goals\na m c : \u2115\nh\u2080 : a + m + c = 12\nh\u2081 : (a + 1) * (m + 1) * (c + 1) = a * m * c + a * m + m * c + a * c + a + m + c + 1\n\u22a2 1 + a + a * m + a * m * c + a * c + m + m * c + c - (1 + a + m + c) = a * m + a * m * c + a * c + m * c\nunknown constant 'Nat.le_of_eq_or_lt'\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, let's understand what's being asked. We have a number n defined as 3\u00b9\u2077 + 3\u00b9\u2070. We know that 11 divides n + 1. The number n is written in base 10 as ABCACCBAB, where A, B, C are distinct digits. A and C are odd, B isn't divisible by 3, and we need to find 100A + 10B + C, which is supposed to be 129. Let's verify that.\n\nFirst, let's compute n = 3\u00b9\u2077 + 3\u00b9\u2070. Maybe simplifying this expression would help. Let's factor out the smaller exponent: 3\u00b9\u2070(3\u2077 + 1). Let's compute 3\u2077 first. 3\u2077 is 2187. So 3\u2077 + 1 = 2188. Therefore, n = 3\u00b9\u2070 * 2188. Hmm, but 3\u00b9\u2070 is 59049. So multiplying 59049 by 2188. That's a big number. But maybe we don't need the exact value because we have the structure ABCACCBAB. Let's note that ABCACCBAB is a 9-digit number. Let's check how many digits 3\u00b9\u2077 and 3\u00b9\u2070 have.\n\n3\u00b9\u2070 is 59049, which is 5 digits. 3\u00b9\u2077 is 129140163, which is 8 digits. Wait, adding those two numbers: 129140163 + 59049 = 129199212. Wait, but that's 9 digits: 129,199,212. But the problem states that n is written as ABCACCBAB. Let me check if 129199212 matches that pattern. Let's see: A=1, B=2, C=9. Then ABCACCBAB would be 1 2 9 1 9 9 2 1 2. Wait, 129199212 is 1 2 9 1 9 9 2 1 2. Yes! That matches ABCACCBAB where A=1, B=2, C=9. So 100A +10B + C would be 100*1 +10*2 +9 = 129. But wait, let's confirm all the conditions.\n\nFirst, A and C must be odd. A is 1 (odd), C is 9 (odd). B is 2, which is not divisible by 3. Correct. All distinct digits. 1, 2, 9 are distinct. So that seems to fit. But how do we get there without computing the entire number?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use the fact that 11 divides n + 1. Let's recall the divisibility rule for 11: the difference between the sum of the digits in odd positions and the sum of the digits in even positions must be a multiple of 11 (including zero). Let's apply that to n + 1. But first, let's figure out the digits of n and then n + 1.\n\nBut since n is given as ABCACCBAB, adding 1 to it would affect the digits. Let's see: ABCACCBAB is a 9-digit number. Let's denote each digit position from left to right as positions 1 to 9. So:\n\nPosition: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nDigits:    A B C A C C B A B\n\nAdding 1 to this number would increment the last digit (position 9) by 1. But since B is a digit, if B is not 9, then n + 1 would end with B + 1, and the rest remains the same. However, if B is 9, then adding 1 would cause a carryover. But since 11 divides n + 1, we can use the divisibility rule on n + 1.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to use the divisibility rule on n + 1. Let's denote the digits of n + 1 as D1 D2 D3 D4 D5 D6 D7 D8 D9. But since n is ABCACCBAB, n + 1 could either be ABCACCBAB + 1, which might be ABCACCBAC if the last digit B is 9 and there's a carryover. Wait, but the problem states that 11 divides n + 1, so we can use the divisibility rule here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use modular arithmetic. Since 11 divides n + 1, then n \u2261 -1 mod 11. So n \u2261 -1 mod 11. Let's compute n = 3\u00b9\u2077 + 3\u00b9\u2070 modulo 11 and see if that equals -1 mod 11. Let's check:\n\nFirst, compute 3^k mod 11. Let's find the pattern. 3^1 mod 11 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9 mod 11\n\n3^3 = 27 mod 11 = 5\n\n3^4 = 15 mod 11 = 4\n\n3^5 = 12 mod 11 = 1\n\n3^5 \u2261 1 mod 11. So the cycle length is 5. Therefore, exponents cycle every 5.\n\nSo 3^10 = (3^5)^2 \u2261 1^2 = 1 mod 11\n\n3^17: 17 divided by 5 is 3 with remainder 2. So 3^17 \u2261 3^(5*3 + 2) = (3^5)^3 * 3^2 \u2261 1^3 * 9 = 9 mod 11\n\nTherefore, n = 3^17 + 3^10 \u2261 9 + 1 = 10 mod 11. Which is -1 mod 11. So n \u2261 -1 mod 11, which means n + 1 \u2261 0 mod 11. That checks out. So that's consistent with the given condition.\n\nBut how does that help us find A, B, C? Let's look at the structure ABCACCBAB. Let's write out the digits:\n\nPositions: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nDigits:    A B C A C C B A B\n\nNow, applying the divisibility rule for 11 on n + 1. Wait, but n + 1 is the number that's divisible by 11. So the digits of n + 1 would be the same as n except possibly the last digit. If B is not 9, then n + 1 would end with B + 1, and the rest same. If B is 9, then adding 1 would make the last digit 0 and carry over to the previous digit (position 8). But position 8 is A. If A is 9, then that would carry over again, etc. But since A and C are digits, and A is odd, possible values are 1,3,5,7,9. Similarly for C. B is not divisible by 3, so B can be 1,2,4,5,7,8.\n\nBut let's assume that B is not 9, so adding 1 doesn't cause a carry. Then the digits of n + 1 would be A, B, C, A, C, C, B, A, B+1. Then applying the divisibility rule: sum of digits in odd positions (positions 1,3,5,7,9) minus sum of digits in even positions (positions 2,4,6,8) must be a multiple of 11.\n\nWait, but the problem states that 11 divides n + 1, so the divisibility rule applies to n + 1. Let's compute the alternating sum for n + 1.\n\nBut first, let's clarify the digits of n + 1. If B is not 9, then the digits are ABCACCBAB + 1 = ABCACCB(A)(B+1). So the last digit becomes B+1, and the rest remain the same. However, if B is 9, then adding 1 would make the last digit 0 and increment the previous digit (position 8) from A to A+1. If A is 9, this could cause another carry, but since A is a digit, if A is 9, then A+1 would be 10, which is not a digit. So B can't be 9 because B is not divisible by 3, and 9 is divisible by 3, so B is not 9. Therefore, B is in {1,2,4,5,7,8}, so B+1 is in {2,3,5,6,8,9}. Therefore, n + 1's digits are ABCACCB(A)(B+1). So the digits of n + 1 are:\n\nPositions: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nDigits:    A B C A C C B A (B+1)\n\nNow, apply the divisibility rule for 11: (sum of digits in odd positions) - (sum of digits in even positions) \u2261 0 mod 11.\n\nOdd positions (1,3,5,7,9): A + C + C + B + (B+1)\n\nEven positions (2,4,6,8): B + A + C + A\n\nCompute the difference:\n\n(A + C + C + B + B + 1) - (B + A + C + A) = A + 2C + 2B + 1 - (B + 2A + C) = A + 2C + 2B +1 - B -2A -C = (-A) + C + B +1\n\nThis difference must be 0 modulo 11. So:\n\n(-A + C + B + 1) \u2261 0 mod 11\n\nWhich implies:\n\nC + B - A + 1 \u2261 0 mod 11\n\nSo:\n\nC + B - A + 1 = 11k for some integer k.\n\nSince A, B, C are digits (0-9), the maximum possible value of C + B - A +1 is 9 + 9 - 0 +1 =19, and the minimum is 0 +0 -9 +1= -8. So possible values for k are 0 or 1.\n\nIf k=0: C + B - A +1 =0 \u2192 C + B - A = -1\n\nIf k=1: C + B - A +1 =11 \u2192 C + B - A =10\n\nSo we have two possibilities.\n\nNow, we need to find digits A, B, C (distinct) where A and C are odd, B not divisible by 3, and either C + B - A = -1 or 10.\n\nAdditionally, the number n is ABCACCBAB. Let's recall that n =3\u00b9\u2077 +3\u00b9\u2070. We computed earlier that n is 129,199,212. Wait, but if we didn't compute that, how else can we find A, B, C?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use the structure of the number ABCACCBAB. Let's note the positions where each digit appears:\n\nA appears in positions 1,4,8\n\nB appears in positions 2,7,9\n\nC appears in positions 3,5,6\n\nSo the digits are:\n\n1: A\n\n2: B\n\n3: C\n\n4: A\n\n5: C\n\n6: C\n\n7: B\n\n8: A\n\n9: B\n\nSo the number is A followed by B, C, A, C, C, B, A, B.\n\nGiven that n =3\u00b9\u2077 +3\u00b9\u2070, which we calculated as 129,199,212, which fits ABCACCBAB with A=1, B=2, C=9. Let's check if that satisfies the equation from the divisibility rule.\n\nFrom earlier, we have C + B - A +1 \u22610 mod11. Plugging in C=9, B=2, A=1:\n\n9 +2 -1 +1 =11 \u2192 11 \u22610 mod11. So k=1. That works.\n\nNow, check the conditions:\n\nA and C are odd: 1 and 9 are odd. B=2 is not divisible by 3. All distinct digits. So that fits.\n\nBut how do we arrive at A=1, B=2, C=9 without computing n directly?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can analyze the possible values.\n\nWe have two cases:\n\nCase 1: C + B - A = -1\n\nCase 2: C + B - A =10\n\nLet's explore both.\n\nCase 1: C + B - A = -1 \u2192 A = C + B +1\n\nSince A is a digit (0-9), and C and B are digits. Also, A and C are odd, B not divisible by 3.\n\nPossible values:\n\nSince A must be odd, and A = C + B +1. Since C is odd, B is 1,2,4,5,7,8.\n\nLet's consider possible C and B:\n\nC is odd (1,3,5,7,9)\n\nB is in {1,2,4,5,7,8}\n\nA = C + B +1. Since A must be a digit (<=9), C + B +1 <=9 \u2192 C + B <=8.\n\nBut C is at least 1 (since digits are distinct and A, B, C are digits, but maybe C could be 0? Wait, no, C is a digit in the number ABCACCBAB. The first digit A cannot be 0, but C could be 0. Wait, but the problem states that A and C are odd. So C must be odd. Therefore, C is in {1,3,5,7,9}.\n\nSo C is at least 1. B is in {1,2,4,5,7,8}. So C + B <=8.\n\nPossible combinations:\n\nC=1:\n\nThen B can be up to 7 (since 1 + B <=8 \u2192 B <=7). But B must be in {1,2,4,5,7,8}. So B can be 1,2,4,5,7.\n\nBut A =1 + B +1 = B +2. Since A must be odd (as per problem statement), B +2 must be odd. So B must be odd. Because B is in {1,2,4,5,7,8}, the odd B's are 1,5,7.\n\nSo possible B=1,5,7.\n\nBut digits must be distinct. A = B +2, C=1.\n\nIf B=1: A=3. Then digits A=3, B=1, C=1. But C=1 and B=1 would be same. Not allowed. So invalid.\n\nIf B=5: A=5+2=7. C=1. So digits A=7, B=5, C=1. All distinct. Check B=5 is not divisible by 3 (5 is not divisible by 3). Valid. So possible.\n\nIf B=7: A=7+2=9. C=1. Digits A=9, B=7, C=1. All distinct. B=7 not divisible by 3. Valid.\n\nSo for C=1, possible (A,B,C) = (7,5,1) and (9,7,1).\n\nNow check if these fit the structure ABCACCBAB. Let's take (7,5,1):\n\nThe number would be 7 5 1 7 1 1 5 7 5. That's 751711575. But n is 3\u00b9\u2077 +3\u00b9\u2070. Let's compute 3\u00b9\u2077=129140163, 3\u00b9\u2070=59049. Sum: 129140163 +59049=129199212. Which is 129199212, which is 1 2 9 1 9 9 2 1 2. So not matching 751711575. So this case is invalid. Similarly, (9,7,1) would give 971711979. Doesn't match n's actual value. So Case 1 seems unlikely.\n\nCase 2: C + B - A =10 \u2192 A = C + B -10\n\nSince A is a digit (0-9), C + B -10 >=0 \u2192 C + B >=10. Also, since C and B are digits (C is odd, B is 1,2,4,5,7,8), let's find possible combinations.\n\nC is odd (1,3,5,7,9), B is in {1,2,4,5,7,8}.\n\nC + B >=10.\n\nPossible pairs:\n\nC=9:\n\nThen B >=1. Let's see:\n\nB can be 1,2,4,5,7,8.\n\nC=9, B=1: 9+1=10 \u2192 A=0. But A is the first digit of a 9-digit number, so A can't be 0. Invalid.\n\nB=2: 9+2=11 \u2192 A=1. Valid. A=1, which is odd. Check distinctness: A=1, B=2, C=9. All distinct. B=2 not divisible by 3. Valid.\n\nB=4: 9+4=13 \u2192 A=3. A=3 (odd). Digits: 3,4,9. All distinct. B=4 not divisible by 3. Valid.\n\nB=5: 9+5=14 \u2192 A=4. But A must be odd. Invalid.\n\nB=7: 9+7=16 \u2192 A=6. A must be odd. Invalid.\n\nB=8: 9+8=17 \u2192 A=7. A=7 (odd). Digits:7,8,9. All distinct. B=8 not divisible by 3. Valid.\n\nSo for C=9, possible (A,B,C) = (1,2,9), (3,4,9), (7,8,9).\n\nNow check these possibilities.\n\nFirst, (A,B,C)=(1,2,9):\n\nNumber ABCACCBAB =1 2 9 1 9 9 2 1 2 \u2192 129199212. Which matches our earlier calculation of n=3\u00b9\u2077 +3\u00b9\u2070=129,199,212. So this is valid.\n\nNext, (3,4,9):\n\nNumber:3 4 9 3 9 9 4 3 4 \u2192349399434. Let's compute 3\u00b9\u2077 +3\u00b9\u2070. As before, it's 129,199,212. Doesn't match. So invalid.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is to find the value of (fourth root of 11) raised to the power of (6x + 2), given that (fourth root of 11) raised to (3x - 3) equals 1/5. And we need to show that the answer is 121 over 25.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how exponents work with roots. The fourth root of 11 is the same as 11 raised to the 1/4 power. So, maybe rewriting the expressions using exponents instead of roots would make it easier to handle.\n\nSo, the given equation is (11^(1/4))^(3x - 3) = 1/5. Let me simplify the left side. When you raise a power to another power, you multiply the exponents. So, 11^( (1/4)*(3x - 3) ) = 1/5. That simplifies to 11^((3x - 3)/4) = 1/5.\n\nNow, I need to solve for x here. Since the equation is 11 to some exponent equals 1/5, maybe taking logarithms would help. But wait, 11 and 1/5 are not powers of the same base, so logarithms might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe express 1/5 as 11 to some exponent, but that's not straightforward. Hmm, perhaps there's another way.\n\nWait, maybe instead of solving for x directly, I can relate the two expressions. The problem asks for (11^(1/4))^(6x + 2). Let me simplify that expression first. Again, using the power of a power rule: 11^( (1/4)*(6x + 2) ) = 11^( (6x + 2)/4 ). So, if I can find the exponent (6x + 2)/4, I can express the desired value in terms of the given equation.\n\nBut how does this relate to the given equation? The given equation has an exponent of (3x - 3)/4 equals log base 11 of 1/5. Wait, maybe if I let\u2019s denote the exponent in the given equation as a variable. Let me set (3x - 3)/4 = k, so 11^k = 1/5. Then, k = log base 11 of (1/5). But I don't know if that helps directly. Maybe there's a way to express (6x + 2)/4 in terms of k.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to express 6x + 2 in terms of 3x - 3. Let's see: 6x + 2 is equal to 2*(3x) + 2. Since 3x - 3 is given, maybe express 3x as (3x - 3) + 3. So, 6x + 2 = 2*( (3x - 3) + 3 ) + 2 = 2*(3x - 3) + 6 + 2 = 2*(3x - 3) + 8. Therefore, the exponent (6x + 2)/4 becomes [2*(3x - 3) + 8]/4 = [2*(3x - 3)]/4 + 8/4 = (3x - 3)/2 + 2.\n\nSo, the exponent in the desired expression is (3x - 3)/2 + 2. Now, from the given equation, we know that 11^((3x - 3)/4) = 1/5. Let me denote (3x - 3)/4 as a variable, say, let\u2019s call it a. Then, a = (3x - 3)/4, so 11^a = 1/5. Then, the exponent in the desired expression is (3x - 3)/2 + 2 = 2a + 2. Therefore, the desired value is 11^(2a + 2) = 11^(2a) * 11^2 = (11^a)^2 * 121.\n\nBut we know that 11^a = 1/5, so substituting that in, we get (1/5)^2 * 121 = (1/25) * 121 = 121/25. That's the answer we need to show. So, the key steps were expressing the desired exponent in terms of the given exponent, using substitution, and then applying exponent rules to simplify.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nLet's start by rewriting the given equation and the expression we need to evaluate using exponent rules. The fourth root of 11 is equivalent to \\(11^{1/4}\\). \n\n**Given:**  \n\\[\n\\left(11^{1/4}\\right)^{3x - 3} = \\frac{1}{5}\n\\]  \nSimplify the left side by multiplying exponents:  \n\\[\n11^{\\frac{3x - 3}{4}} = \\frac{1}{5}.\n\\]  \nLet\u2019s denote \\(a = \\frac{3x - 3}{4}\\). Then the equation becomes:  \n\\[\n11^{a} = \\frac{1}{5}.\n\\]  \n\n**Goal:**  \nFind \\(\\left(11^{1/4}\\right)^{6x + 2}\\).  \nSimplify the exponent first:  \n\\[\n11^{\\frac{6x + 2}{4}} = 11^{\\frac{3x + 1}{2}}.\n\\]  \nNotice that \\(6x + 2 = 2(3x - 3) + 8\\). Substitute \\(3x - 3 = 4a\\) (from \\(a = \\frac{3x - 3}{4}\\)):  \n\\[\n\\frac{6x + 2}{4} = \\frac{2(4a) + 8}{4} = \\frac{8a + 8}{4} = 2a + 2.\n\\]  \nThus, the expression becomes:  \n\\[\n11^{2a + 2} = 11^{2a} \\cdot 11^{2}.\n\\]  \nWe know \\(11^{a} = \\frac{1}{5}\\), so \\(11^{2a} = \\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{25}\\). Substitute this back:  \n\\[\n11^{2a + 2} = \\frac{1}{25} \\cdot 121 = \\frac{121}{25}.\n\\]  \nTherefore, \\(\\left(\\sqrt[4]{11}\\right)^{6x + 2} = \\frac{121}{25}\\).",

So, two equations with three variables. Since there are more variables than equations, usually we might expect infinitely many solutions, but the problem states that x is uniquely determined to be 14. So, my goal is to show that regardless of the values of y and z, x must be 14.\n\nFirst, maybe I can try to eliminate variables. Let's see. Let me write the equations again:\n\n1) 3x + 4y -12z = 10\n\n2) -2x -3y +9z = -4\n\nI need to eliminate either y or z. Let's see if I can eliminate y first. To eliminate y, I can multiply the equations by coefficients that make the coefficients of y the same (or negatives) so that when I add the equations, y cancels out.\n\nLooking at the coefficients of y: 4 in the first equation and -3 in the second. The least common multiple of 4 and 3 is 12. So, multiply the first equation by 3 and the second by 4. Let's try that.\n\nMultiply equation 1 by 3:\n\n3*(3x +4y -12z) = 3*10 \u2192 9x +12y -36z = 30 (Equation 3)\n\nMultiply equation 2 by 4:\n\n4*(-2x -3y +9z) = 4*(-4) \u2192 -8x -12y +36z = -16 (Equation 4)\n\nNow, add equation 3 and equation 4:\n\n(9x -8x) + (12y -12y) + (-36z +36z) = 30 -16\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nx + 0y + 0z = 14\n\nSo, x = 14. That's exactly what we needed to show. Wait, that was straightforward? Let me check again.\n\nOriginal equations:\n\n1) 3x +4y -12z =10\n\n2) -2x -3y +9z =-4\n\nAfter multiplying equation 1 by 3: 9x +12y -36z =30\n\nAfter multiplying equation 2 by 4: -8x -12y +36z =-16\n\nAdding them: 9x -8x = x; 12y -12y =0; -36z +36z=0. So x =30 -16=14. Yep, that's right. So x must be 14 regardless of y and z. Therefore, x=14 is the solution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this, like solving one equation for a variable and substituting. Let me try that to confirm.\n\nTake equation 2: -2x -3y +9z = -4. Let's solve for one variable, say y.\n\n-2x -3y +9z = -4 \u2192 -3y = 2x -9z -4 \u2192 y = (-2x +9z +4)/3\n\nNow plug this expression for y into equation 1:\n\n3x +4*(-2x +9z +4)/3 -12z =10\n\nMultiply through by 3 to eliminate denominators:\n\n9x +4*(-2x +9z +4) -36z =30\n\nExpand:\n\n9x -8x +36z +16 -36z =30\n\nSimplify:\n\nx +16 =30 \u2192 x=14.

Therefore, the answer is 14.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo solve for \\( x \\) in the system:\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n3x + 4y - 12z &= 10, \\\\\n-2x - 3y + 9z &= -4,\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nwe can eliminate \\( y \\) and \\( z \\) by combining the equations strategically. Here's how:\n\n1. **Multiply the first equation by 3** to prepare for elimination:\n   \\[\n   9x + 12y - 36z = 30.\n   \\]\n2. **Multiply the second equation by 4** to align coefficients:\n   \\[\n   -8x - 12y + 36z = -16.\n   \\]\n3. **Add the two modified equations**:\n   \\[\n   (9x - 8x) + (12y - 12y) + (-36z + 36z) = 30 - 16.\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, all \\( y \\) and \\( z \\) terms cancel out:\n   \\[\n   x = 14.\n   \\]\n\nThis shows that \\( x = 14 \\) is the unique solution for \\( x \\), independent of \\( y \\) and \\( z \\).

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have seven cubes with volumes decreasing from bottom to top. The volumes are 1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, and 343 cubic units. Each cube is stacked such that, except for the bottom one, each cube's bottom face lies completely on top of the cube below. We need to find the total surface area of the tower, including the bottom. The answer is supposed to be 658, option B. Let's see how to get there.\n\nFirst, I remember that the volume of a cube is side length cubed. So, if the volume is V, the side length is the cube root of V. Let's list out the side lengths for each cube. \n\nStarting from the bottom (largest volume) to the top (smallest), the volumes are 343, 216, 125, 64, 27, 8, 1. Wait, the problem says the volumes decrease from bottom to top, so the bottom cube is 343, then 216, etc., up to 1 at the top. So, their side lengths would be cube roots of these. Let's compute those:\n\n- 343: cube root is 7 (since 7\u00b3=343)\n- 216: cube root is 6 (6\u00b3=216)\n- 125: cube root is 5\n- 64: cube root is 4\n- 27: cube root is 3\n- 8: cube root is 2\n- 1: cube root is 1\n\nSo the side lengths from bottom to top are 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 units.\n\nNow, each cube is stacked such that each one (except the bottom) sits entirely on top of the one below. That means each cube is centered on top of the previous one, right? Because if the cube above is smaller, it can't extend beyond the edges of the cube below. So, the bottom face of each cube is fully on top of the cube below. Therefore, each cube's base is exactly the same as the top face of the cube below, but since they are smaller, they only cover a part of it. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says \"the bottom face of each cube lies completely on top of the cube below it.\" So the entire bottom face of each cube must be on top of the cube below. That implies that the cube above must have a side length less than or equal to the cube below. Which they do, since they are decreasing. So each cube is placed such that its entire base is on the cube below. So, for example, the second cube (side 6) is placed on top of the first cube (side 7). Since 6 < 7, the 6x6 base of the second cube is centered on the 7x7 top face of the first cube. Similarly, the third cube (side 5) is centered on the 6x6 top face of the second cube, and so on.\n\nNow, to compute the total surface area. Let's recall that the surface area of a cube is 6 times the side length squared. But when cubes are stacked, some faces are covered, so we need to adjust for overlapping areas.\n\nEach cube, except the bottom one, will have its bottom face covered by the cube above. Wait, no. Wait, each cube (except the bottom one) has its bottom face lying on top of the cube below. So the bottom face of each cube (from the second to the top) is glued to the top face of the cube below. Therefore, those faces are not exposed. Similarly, the top face of each cube (except the top one) is covered by the cube above. So, for each cube except the bottom and top, their top and bottom faces are covered. The bottom cube's bottom face is exposed, and the top cube's top face is exposed.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"total surface area of the tower (including the bottom)\". So the bottom face of the bottom cube is counted. The top face of the top cube is also counted. But all the interfaces between cubes (where one cube sits on another) are covered, so those areas are subtracted.\n\nBut also, when a smaller cube is placed on top of a larger one, the sides of the larger cube that are above the smaller cube's height might still be exposed. Wait, no. Wait, the cubes are stacked vertically. Each cube is placed directly on top of the previous one. Since each cube is smaller, the sides of the lower cubes will be exposed above where the next cube is placed. For example, the first cube has side length 7. The second cube is 6x6x6, placed on top. The first cube's height is 7 units. The second cube adds 6 units in height. But the sides of the first cube that are above the second cube's height would be the part from 6 to 7 units up. Wait, no. Wait, the cubes are stacked vertically, so each cube's height is added. The first cube is 7 units tall. The second cube is 6 units tall, so the total height after two cubes is 7 + 6. But the side length of each cube is only relevant for their horizontal dimensions. Wait, maybe I'm confusing the vertical stacking with horizontal dimensions.\n\nWait, cubes are three-dimensional. Each cube has a side length, so when you stack them vertically, each cube's height is equal to its side length. Wait, no. Wait, a cube's height is the same as its side length. So the first cube (side 7) has height 7. The second cube (side 6) has height 6, so the total height of the tower after two cubes is 7 + 6. But the horizontal dimensions (length and width) of each cube are their side lengths. So when you place a smaller cube on top, the horizontal area it occupies is smaller, but vertically, each cube's height adds up.\n\nBut surface area is about the exposed faces. Let's think about each face:\n\n1. The bottom face of the bottom cube: this is exposed and contributes 7\u00b2 = 49 square units.\n\n2. The top face of the top cube: this is exposed and contributes 1\u00b2 = 1 square unit.\n\n3. For each cube, the four side faces. However, when a smaller cube is placed on top, part of the side faces of the lower cube may be covered. Wait, no. Because each cube is placed entirely on top of the one below, but since the cubes are getting smaller, each subsequent cube is centered on the previous one. Therefore, the sides of the lower cubes are not covered by the upper cubes. Wait, but the upper cubes are smaller, so they don't extend to the edges of the lower cubes. Therefore, the sides of each cube are fully exposed except where they are covered by the cube above. Wait, no. Let me visualize this.\n\nTake the first cube (side 7). Its four side faces each have area 7\u00b2. Then, on top of it, we place a cube of side 6. The second cube is centered on the first, so each side of the second cube is 1 unit smaller on each side (since 7 - 6 = 1, so 0.5 units on each side if centered, but since side lengths are integers, maybe it's exactly 1 unit). Wait, but 7 and 6: the difference is 1. If the second cube is centered, then there's a 0.5 unit overhang on each side. But since we can't have half units here, maybe the cubes are aligned such that the smaller cube is placed flush with one edge? Wait, the problem says \"the bottom face of each cube lies completely on top of the cube below it\". So the entire bottom face of the upper cube must be on top of the lower cube. Therefore, the upper cube must be placed such that its base is entirely within the base of the lower cube. Since the upper cube is smaller, it can be centered. For example, a 6x6 cube on a 7x7 cube would have a 0.5 unit border around it if centered. But since the problem doesn't specify alignment, we can assume that the cubes are centered, leading to symmetric overhangs.\n\nHowever, when calculating surface area, the key point is that the sides of each cube are exposed except where they are covered by the cube above. Wait, no. The sides of each cube are vertical faces. When you place a smaller cube on top, it doesn't cover the vertical sides of the lower cube. The vertical sides of the lower cube are still exposed. The only parts that are covered are the top face of the lower cube (covered by the bottom face of the upper cube) and the bottom face of the upper cube (which is glued to the top face of the lower cube). The vertical sides of each cube remain exposed. Therefore, each cube's four side faces are fully exposed, except for the parts that might be covered by the cube above. Wait, no. Wait, the vertical sides of each cube are separate. For example, the first cube has vertical sides that go from height 0 to 7. The second cube is placed on top, from height 7 to 7 + 6 = 13. The vertical sides of the second cube are from 7 to 13, while the first cube's sides are from 0 to 7. They don't overlap vertically, so the vertical faces of all cubes are fully exposed. Therefore, the total surface area would be the sum of all the side areas of each cube, plus the bottom face of the bottom cube and the top face of the top cube.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because if each cube's vertical sides are fully exposed, then each cube contributes 4*(side length)^2 to the surface area. But then, for example, the first cube's surface area would be 6*7\u00b2, but since the bottom face is counted once, and the top face is covered by the second cube. Wait, no. Let's think again.\n\nEach cube has 6 faces. When stacked:\n\n- The bottom cube (side 7) has its bottom face exposed (counted), its top face covered by the second cube, and its four side faces exposed. So its contribution to the surface area is 1 (bottom) + 4 (sides) = 5 faces: 5*(7\u00b2).\n\n- The second cube (side 6) has its bottom face covered by the top face of the first cube, its top face covered by the third cube, and its four side faces exposed. So it contributes 4*(6\u00b2).\n\n- Similarly, each middle cube (from the second to the sixth) contributes 4*(side\u00b2).\n\n- The top cube (side 1) has its bottom face covered by the sixth cube, and its top face exposed. So it contributes 4*(1\u00b2) (sides) + 1 (top) = 5*(1\u00b2).\n\nWait, but let's check:\n\nWait, the first cube: bottom face (1) + 4 side faces (each 7x7). The top face is covered, so not counted. So 1*7\u00b2 + 4*7\u00b2 = 5*7\u00b2 = 5*49 = 245.\n\nSecond cube: bottom face is covered, top face is covered (by third cube), so only 4 side faces: 4*6\u00b2 = 4*36 = 144.\n\nThird cube: same as second, 4*5\u00b2 = 4*25 = 100.\n\nFourth cube: 4*4\u00b2 = 64.\n\nFifth cube: 4*3\u00b2 = 36.\n\nSixth cube: 4*2\u00b2 = 16.\n\nTop cube (seventh): bottom face covered, top face exposed. So 4*1\u00b2 (sides) + 1*1\u00b2 (top) = 5*1 = 5.\n\nAdding all these up:\n\n245 (first) + 144 (second) + 100 (third) + 64 (fourth) + 36 (fifth) + 16 (sixth) + 5 (seventh) = Let's compute step by step:\n\n245 + 144 = 389\n\n389 + 100 = 489\n\n489 + 64 = 553\n\n553 + 36 = 589\n\n589 + 16 = 605\n\n605 + 5 = 610.\n\nBut 610 is not one of the answer choices. The options are 644, 658, 664, 720, 749. So clearly, this approach is missing something.\n\nWait, where's the mistake here? Let's reconsider.\n\nAh! I think I forgot that when a smaller cube is placed on top of a larger one, the larger cube's top face is partially exposed. Wait, no. The problem states that \"Except for the bottom cube, the bottom face of each cube lies completely on top of the cube below it.\" So the entire bottom face of each upper cube is on the cube below. Therefore, the top face of each lower cube is completely covered by the upper cube's bottom face only if the upper cube is the same size. But since each upper cube is smaller, the top face of the lower cube is only partially covered. Wait, no. Wait, the bottom face of the upper cube is entirely on top of the lower cube. But if the upper cube is smaller, then the area of the lower cube's top face that is covered is equal to the area of the upper cube's bottom face. The remaining part of the lower cube's top face is still exposed. For example, the first cube (side 7) has a top face of 7x7. The second cube (side 6) is placed on top, covering a 6x6 area. Therefore, the remaining area on the first cube's top face is 7x7 - 6x6 = 49 - 36 = 13. This area is exposed and contributes to the total surface area.\n\nOh! So I missed that each time a smaller cube is placed on top, the top face of the lower cube has an annular region (the part not covered by the upper cube) that is exposed. Therefore, for each cube except the top one, we need to add the area of the top face minus the area covered by the next cube. Similarly, the bottom face of each upper cube is entirely on the lower cube, so their bottom faces are not exposed, but the top face of the lower cube has an exposed ring.\n\nTherefore, the total surface area should include:\n\n- The bottom face of the bottom cube: 7\u00b2 = 49.\n\n- The top face of the top cube: 1\u00b2 = 1.\n\n- For each cube from the first to the sixth, the exposed part of their top face: (side_k)^2 - (side_{k+1})^2.\n\n- The four side faces of each cube: 4*(side_k)^2.\n\nWait, but the side faces: each cube's side faces are fully exposed because the next cube is smaller and doesn't extend beyond the current cube's sides. Wait, but vertically, the next cube is placed on top, so the side faces of the lower cube are still exposed from the bottom up to their height. The upper cube's side faces are exposed from their base upwards. Since each cube is stacked vertically, their side faces don't overlap. So each cube's four side faces are fully exposed. Therefore, each cube contributes 4*(side length)^2 to the surface area.\n\nBut then, the top face of each cube (except the top one) has an exposed area of (side_k)^2 - (side_{k+1})^2. Similarly, the bottom face of each cube (except the bottom one) is covered, so their bottom faces don't contribute. The bottom cube's bottom face is 7\u00b2, and the top cube's top face is 1\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, the total surface area would be:\n\nBottom face: 7\u00b2 = 49.\n\nTop face: 1\u00b2 = 1.\n\nFor each cube from 1 to 6 (since the seventh is the top), the exposed top area: (side_k)^2 - (side_{k+1})^2.\n\nPlus, for each cube, the four side faces: 4*(side_k)^2.\n\nSo let's compute this.\n\nFirst, list the cubes from bottom (k=1) to top (k=7):\n\nk | side length\n1 | 7\n2 | 6\n3 | 5\n4 | 4\n5 | 3\n6 | 2\n7 | 1\n\nNow, compute for each cube k from 1 to 6:\n\nExposed top area: side_k\u00b2 - side_{k+1}\u00b2.\n\nFor k=1: 7\u00b2 - 6\u00b2 = 49 - 36 = 13\n\nk=2: 6\u00b2 -5\u00b2=36-25=11\n\nk=3:25-16=9\n\nk=4:16-9=7\n\nk=5:9-4=5\n\nk=6:4-1=3\n\nSum of exposed top areas: 13+11+9+7+5+3=48\n\nThen, the four side faces for each cube:\n\nFor each cube k=1 to 7:\n\n4*side_k\u00b2\n\nCompute each:\n\nk=1:4*49=196\n\nk=2:4*36=144\n\nk=3:4*25=100\n\nk=4:4*16=64\n\nk=5:4*9=36\n\nk=6:4*4=16\n\nk=7:4*1=4\n\nSum of side faces:196+144+100+64+36+16+4= 196+144=340; 340+100=440; 440+64=504; 504+36=540; 540+16=556; 556+4=560.\n\nNow, total surface area is:\n\nBottom face (49) + top face (1) + exposed top areas (48) + side faces (560).\n\nSo total SA = 49 + 1 + 48 + 560 = 49+1=50; 50+48=98; 98+560=658.\n\nAh! That's the answer, 658, option B.\n\nSo the key was realizing that each cube's top face (except the topmost) has an exposed ring around the next cube, which contributes (side_k\u00b2 - side_{k+1}\u00b2) to the surface area. Additionally, all the vertical side faces are fully exposed, contributing 4*side_k\u00b2 for each cube. Plus the bottom and top faces.\n\nLet me verify this again with an example. Take the first cube (side 7). Its top face has area 49, but the second cube (side 6) covers 36, leaving 13 exposed. The four sides of the first cube contribute 4*49=196. Then the second cube's top face has area 36, but the third cube (side 5) covers 25, leaving 11 exposed. The four sides of the second cube contribute 4*36=144. And so on. Summing all these gives the total",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to figure out what f(4, 1981) is based on the given recursive definitions. The function f has three rules, and all variables are non-negative integers. Let me start by understanding the structure of the function.\n\nFirst, let's look at the three conditions:\n\n1. f(0, y) = y + 1\n2. f(x + 1, 0) = f(x, 1)\n3. f(x + 1, y + 1) = f(x, f(x + 1, y))\n\nThis reminds me a lot of the Ackermann function, which is a known recursive function that's not primitive recursive. The Ackermann function also has similar definitions, where the function grows very rapidly. Let me check if these definitions match the Ackermann function's structure.\n\nThe standard Ackermann function A(m, n) is usually defined as:\n- A(0, n) = n + 1\n- A(m + 1, 0) = A(m, 1)\n- A(m + 1, n + 1) = A(m, A(m + 1, n))\n\nComparing this to the given function f(x, y), they look identical if we consider x as m and y as n. So, f(x, y) here seems to be the Ackermann function. If that's the case, then f(4, 1981) would be A(4, 1981), which is known to be an extremely large number. But let me verify this step by step to be sure.\n\nLet's compute some small values to see the pattern.\n\nStarting with x=0:\nf(0, y) = y + 1. That's straightforward, matches the first condition.\n\nFor x=1:\nLet's compute f(1, 0) first. Using condition 2: f(1, 0) = f(0, 1) = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nNow f(1, 1) would be f(0, f(1, 0)) = f(0, 2) = 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nSimilarly, f(1, 2) = f(0, f(1, 1)) = f(0, 3) = 4. So it seems f(1, y) = y + 2.\n\nWait, let's check that. If f(1, y) = y + 2, then for y=0, f(1,0)=2, which matches. For y=1, 3; y=2,4, etc. So yes, f(1, y) = y + 2.\n\nNow x=2:\n\nCompute f(2, 0) using condition 2: f(2,0) = f(1,1) = 3 (from earlier).\n\nThen f(2,1) = f(1, f(2,0)) = f(1,3) = 3 + 2 = 5.\n\nf(2,2) = f(1, f(2,1)) = f(1,5) = 5 + 2 = 7.\n\nWait, but this seems like f(2,y) = 2y + 3? Wait, for y=0:3, y=1:5, y=2:7. Hmm, 3,5,7... that's 2y + 3. Let's check y=3: f(2,3)=f(1,f(2,2))=f(1,7)=9. Yes, 2*3 +3=9. So f(2,y)=2y +3? Wait, 2y +3 for y=0 gives 3, which matches. So f(2,y) = 2y + 3. Wait, but 2y +3 for y=0 is 3, which is correct. So f(2,y) = 2y +3. Then f(2,y) = 2*(y+1) +1? Wait, maybe not. Let me see. Alternatively, maybe f(2,y) = 2^{y+3} -3? Wait, no. Let's compute more terms. Wait, f(2,0)=3, f(2,1)=5, f(2,2)=7, f(2,3)=9... It's just adding 2 each time. So f(2,y) = 2y +3. That's linear. But the Ackermann function for m=2 is supposed to be multiplication by 2, but maybe I'm mixing up the parameters. Wait, Ackermann's function for m=2 is A(2,n) = 2n +3? Wait, no. Let me check the standard Ackermann function again. Wait, the standard Ackermann function for m=0 is n+1, m=1 is n+2, m=2 is 2n +3, m=3 is 2^(n+3) -3, and m=4 is a tower of exponents. Wait, maybe that's the case here. Let's confirm.\n\nFor x=3:\n\nCompute f(3,0) = f(2,1) =5.\n\nf(3,1) = f(2, f(3,0)) = f(2,5) = 2*5 +3 =13.\n\nf(3,2) = f(2, f(3,1)) = f(2,13) =2*13 +3=29.\n\nWait, but 5,13,29... These numbers don't seem to follow a simple linear pattern. Let's see:\n\nf(3,0)=5\n\nf(3,1)=13=2*5 +3? 2*5=10 +3=13. Hmm, maybe. Then f(3,2)=2*13 +3=29, yes. Then f(3,y) = 2*f(3,y-1) +3. But that's a recurrence relation. Let's solve it. Suppose f(3,y) = 2^{y+3} -3. Let's check:\n\nFor y=0: 2^{0+3} -3=8-3=5. Correct.\n\ny=1: 2^4 -3=16-3=13. Correct.\n\ny=2:2^5 -3=32-3=29. Correct. So f(3,y)=2^{y+3} -3.\n\nSimilarly, for x=4:\n\nf(4,0)=f(3,1)=13.\n\nf(4,1)=f(3,f(4,0))=f(3,13)=2^{13+3} -3=2^16 -3=65536 -3=65533.\n\nf(4,2)=f(3,f(4,1))=f(3,65533)=2^{65533 +3} -3=2^65536 -3. That's an astronomically large number.\n\nSo f(4,y) would be a tower of exponents. Specifically, f(4,y) = 2^{2^{2^{...^{2^3}}}} with y+3 twos? Wait, maybe not exactly, but it's a power tower of 2s of height y+3 minus 3. Wait, for y=0, f(4,0)=13=2^2^2 -3 (since 2^2^2=16, 16-3=13). Wait, 2^2^2 is 16, so 16-3=13. Then f(4,1)=2^2^2^2 -3=2^16 -3=65536-3=65533. Then f(4,2)=2^2^2^2^2 -3, which is 2^65536 -3. So each increment in y adds another exponentiation layer. Therefore, f(4,1981) would be a power tower of 2s of height 1981 +3 =1984, minus 3. But writing that out is impractical, but that's the form.\n\nSo the answer is f(4,1981) = 2^2^...^2 -3 with 1984 twos in the tower. But since the problem asks to \"determine\" it, and given that this is an Ackermann function, the answer is typically expressed in terms of the Ackermann function, which for A(4,1981) is indeed a tower of 2s of height 1984 minus 3. However, since the problem might expect recognizing it as the Ackermann function and stating the result in that form, perhaps the answer is 2\u2191\u21911984 -3, where \u2191\u2191 denotes tetration. But I need to confirm the exact form.\n\nAlternatively, since each step for x=4 builds a tower of exponents, starting from f(4,0)=13=2^2^2 -3, then f(4,1)=2^2^2^2 -3=2^4 -3=16-3=13? Wait, no, wait. Wait, f(4,0)=13=2^2^2 -3 (since 2^2=4, 4^2=16, but no, 2^2^2 is 2^(2^2)=2^4=16, 16-3=13. Then f(4,1)=f(3,f(4,0))=f(3,13)=2^{13+3} -3=2^16 -3=65536-3=65533. Then f(4,2)=f(3,f(4,1))=f(3,65533)=2^{65533+3} -3=2^65536 -3. So each time y increases by 1, the exponent becomes the previous result plus 3, but actually, the exponent is the previous value of f(4,y-1) +3. Wait, but f(3,y)=2^{y+3} -3, so when we compute f(3, k), it's 2^{k+3} -3. Therefore, f(4,1)=f(3,13)=2^{13+3} -3=2^16 -3. Similarly, f(4,2)=f(3, f(4,1))=f(3, 2^16 -3)=2^{(2^16 -3)+3} -3=2^{2^16} -3. Then f(4,3)=2^{2^{2^16}} -3, and so on. So each y step adds another exponent. Therefore, f(4,y) is a tower of y+3 2s minus 3. For example:\n\nf(4,0) = 2^2^2 -3 (3 twos) = 16-3=13\n\nf(4,1) = 2^2^2^2 -3 (4 twos) = 65536-3=65533\n\nf(4,2) = 2^2^2^2^2 -3 (5 twos) = 2^65536 -3\n\nSo for y=1981, the number of 2s in the tower would be 1981 +3 =1984. Therefore, f(4,1981)=2\u2191\u21911984 -3, where \u2191\u2191 represents tetration (iterated exponentiation). However, since the problem might expect the answer in terms of the Ackermann function, and given that the function definitions match Ackermann's, the answer is indeed this tower of 2s minus 3. But since the problem asks to \"determine\" f(4,1981), and given the recursive definitions, the answer is this enormous number which can't be written out explicitly, so the answer is expressed in terms of the tower of exponents.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nThe function \\( f(x, y) \\) defined by the given recursive rules is recognized as the Ackermann function, a well-known example of a computable function that is not primitive recursive. Let's analyze the definitions step by step to determine \\( f(4, 1981) \\).\n\n1. **Base Case (\\( x = 0 \\))**:  \n   \\( f(0, y) = y + 1 \\). This matches the first rule of the Ackermann function \\( A(0, n) = n + 1 \\).\n\n2. **Recursive Case 1 (\\( x > 0, y = 0 \\))**:  \n   \\( f(x + 1, 0) = f(x, 1) \\). This aligns with \\( A(m + 1, 0) = A(m, 1) \\).\n\n3. **Recursive Case 2 (\\( x > 0, y > 0 \\))**:  \n   \\( f(x + 1, y + 1) = f(x, f(x + 1, y)) \\), which mirrors \\( A(m + 1, n + 1) = A(m, A(m + 1, n)) \\).\n\nThus, \\( f(x, y) \\) is equivalent to the Ackermann function \\( A(x, y) \\). The Ackermann function grows extremely rapidly, especially for larger \\( x \\). Let\u2019s compute \\( f(4, 1981) \\):\n\n- **For \\( x = 4 \\), the Ackermann function \\( A(4, y) \\) generates a tower of exponents**:  \n  - \\( A(4, 0) = A(3, 1) = 13 \\),  \n  - \\( A(4, 1) = A(3, A(4, 0)) = A(3, 13) = 2^{16} - 3 = 65533 \\),  \n  - \\( A(4, 2) = A(3, A(4, 1)) = A(3, 65533) = 2^{65536} - 3 \\),  \n  - and so on.  \n\nEach increment in \\( y \\) adds another layer of exponentiation.

The result is therefore expressed in terms of iterated exponentiation (tetration), confirming that \\( f(4, 1981) \\) is a tower of 1984 twos minus 3.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is to find y such that the square root of (19 plus 3 times y) equals 7, and then show that the solution is 10. Alright, so first, I need to solve the equation \u221a(19 + 3y) = 7. \n\nHmm, square roots can sometimes be tricky because of the principal square root concept. But here, since the square root is equal to 7, which is a positive number, I don't have to worry about the negative root. So, the first step is probably to square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square root. That makes sense because squaring is the inverse operation of taking a square root.\n\nLet me write that down: If \u221a(19 + 3y) = 7, then squaring both sides gives (\u221a(19 + 3y))\u00b2 = 7\u00b2. Which simplifies to 19 + 3y = 49. \n\nNow, solving for y. Subtract 19 from both sides: 3y = 49 - 19. That's 3y = 30. Then divide both sides by 3: y = 30 / 3 = 10. So, y is 10. \n\nWait, but I should check if this solution is valid. Sometimes when you square both sides of an equation, you might introduce extraneous solutions. So, plugging y = 10 back into the original equation to verify. Let's compute the left side: \u221a(19 + 3*10) = \u221a(19 + 30) = \u221a49 = 7, which matches the right side. So, it works. \n\nIs there anything else to consider here? The problem mentions showing that it is 10, so maybe they want to ensure that there are no other solutions. Since the square root function is defined to return the non-negative root, and we squared both sides leading to a linear equation which has only one solution, y=10 is the only valid solution. \n\nI don't think there are any other steps needed here. The process is straightforward: isolate the square root, square both sides, solve the linear equation, and check the solution. The check confirms that it's valid, so y=10 is indeed the correct answer.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo solve the equation \\(\\sqrt{19 + 3y} = 7\\) for \\(y\\), we start by eliminating the square root.

However, in this case, \\(y = 10\\) is the only solution that satisfies the original equation.

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the inverse of 9 modulo 100, which means I need to find a number x such that when I multiply it by 9 and then divide by 100, the remainder is 1. In other words, 9x \u2261 1 mod 100. The problem also mentions that the answer should be 89, so I need to verify that 9*89 gives a remainder of 1 when divided by 100.\n\nFirst, let me recall what modular inverses are. An inverse of a number a modulo m is a number b such that a*b \u2261 1 mod m. For the inverse to exist, a and m must be coprime, which means their greatest common divisor (gcd) should be 1. Since 9 and 100 are coprime (their gcd is 1), the inverse should exist.\n\nSo, I need to solve 9x \u2261 1 mod 100. To find x, I can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which finds integers x and y such that 9x + 100y = 1. The x here would be the inverse.\n\nLet me try applying the Extended Euclidean Algorithm step by step:\n\nFirst, divide 100 by 9. 100 divided by 9 is 11 with a remainder of 1. So, 100 = 9*11 + 1.\n\nThen, rearrange this equation to express the remainder as a linear combination: 1 = 100 - 9*11.\n\nThis equation shows that x = -11 and y = 1 is a solution. However, we need x to be a positive integer between 0 and 99. Since -11 mod 100 is the same as 89 (because 100 - 11 = 89), the inverse is 89.\n\nLet me check this: 9*89 = 801. When I divide 801 by 100, the remainder is 1. So yes, 801 mod 100 is 1. That confirms that 89 is indeed the inverse of 9 modulo 100.\n\nAlternatively, I could approach this by trial and error since 100 isn't too large. Multiply 9 by numbers from 1 upwards until the product ends with 01 (since 1 mod 100 is ...01). Let's see:\n\n9*1 = 9 \u2192 09 mod 100 is 9, not 1.\n9*2 = 18 \u2192 18\n...\n9*11 = 99 \u2192 99\n9*12 = 108 \u2192 08\n...\n9*89 = 801 \u2192 01. There we go. So 89 works.\n\nAnother way to think about it is using the fact that 9*11 = 99 \u2261 -1 mod 100. So if 9*11 \u2261 -1, then multiplying both sides by -1 gives 9*(-11) \u2261 1 mod 100. But -11 mod 100 is 89, so 9*89 \u22611 mod 100. That's another way to see it.\n\nAlso, looking back at the context provided, there's something about 1/89 and 9/89 having decimal expansions that are cyclic permutations. Specifically, multiplying 1/89 by 9 shifts the decimal digits. This might relate to the fact that 89 is the inverse of 9 modulo 10^n for some n, but here we're dealing with modulo 100. However, the connection here might be that since 9*89 \u22611 mod 100, multiplying by 9 shifts the digits in the decimal expansion, which is similar to moving the last digit to the front. But maybe that's a deeper connection for another problem. For this specific problem, the key is the modular inverse.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the inverse of 9 modulo 100 is 89 because 9*89 = 801, which leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 100. The Extended Euclidean Algorithm confirms this by showing that 1 can be expressed as 100 - 9*11, leading to x = -11, which is equivalent to 89 modulo 100.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo find \\(9^{-1} \\pmod{100}\\), we need an integer \\(x\\) such that \\(9x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{100}\\). This means \\(9x\\) must leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 100. \n\nFirst, observe that 9 and 100 are coprime (their greatest common divisor is 1), so an inverse exists. We can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to solve \\(9x + 100y = 1\\) for integers \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). \n\nStarting with the division steps:\n1. \\(100 = 9 \\cdot 11 + 1\\) (dividing 100 by 9 gives a quotient of 11 and remainder 1).\n2. Rearranging this equation: \\(1 = 100 - 9 \\cdot 11\\).\n\nThis directly gives \\(x = -11\\) as a solution. To express \\(x\\) as a positive residue modulo 100, compute \\(-11 \\pmod{100}\\), which is \\(100 - 11 = 89\\). \n\nVerification confirms this: \\(9 \\cdot 89 = 801\\), and \\(801 \\div 100\\) leaves a remainder of 1. Thus, \\(9 \\cdot 89 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{100}\\), proving that \\(9^{-1} \\pmod{100} = 89\\). \n\nAdditionally, trial multiplication (checking multiples of 9 until the product ends with \"01\") also leads to \\(9 \\cdot 89 = 801\\), reinforcing the result. The connection to the decimal expansions in the context hints at deeper cyclic properties, but here the modular arithmetic suffices to establish the inverse.\nPrevious attempt failed with: type mismatch\n  h\u2082\nhas type\n  x * 9 % 100 = 1 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  x = 89 : Prop\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The goal is to evaluate the sum of the products of consecutive inverses modulo a prime p (where p is at least 7) and show that it's congruent to 2 mod p. The sum is from 1\u207b\u00b9\u00b72\u207b\u00b9 up to (p-2)\u207b\u00b9\u00b7(p-1)\u207b\u00b9. \n\nFirst, I need to recall that in modular arithmetic, especially modulo a prime p, every number from 1 to p-1 has an inverse. So, the inverses here are all well-defined. The sum is S = \u03a3_{k=1}^{p-2} (k\u207b\u00b9)(k+1)\u207b\u00b9 mod p. \n\nHmm, maybe I can find a way to simplify each term in the sum. Let's look at a general term: (k\u207b\u00b9)(k+1)\u207b\u00b9. If I can express this as a difference of two fractions, then the sum might telescope. Let's try to manipulate this term. \n\nLet me consider the expression 1/(k(k+1)). In regular fractions, this is equal to 1/k - 1/(k+1). Wait, but here we have inverses modulo p. Let me check if this identity holds modulo p. \n\nYes, because modulo p, 1/(k(k+1)) \u2261 (1/k - 1/(k+1)) * 1/(1) mod p. Wait, actually, in regular fractions, 1/(k(k+1)) = 1/k - 1/(k+1). So, translating this to modular inverses, each term (k\u207b\u00b9)(k+1)\u207b\u00b9 should be equivalent to (k\u207b\u00b9 - (k+1)\u207b\u00b9) mod p. Let me verify this. \n\nLet's compute (k\u207b\u00b9 - (k+1)\u207b\u00b9) mod p. That would be (1/k - 1/(k+1)) = (k+1 - k)/(k(k+1)) = 1/(k(k+1)), which is exactly the term in the sum. So, each term in the sum S can be written as (k\u207b\u00b9 - (k+1)\u207b\u00b9) mod p. \n\nTherefore, the entire sum S is the sum from k=1 to k=p-2 of (k\u207b\u00b9 - (k+1)\u207b\u00b9). When we expand this sum, most terms should cancel out telescopically. Let's write out the first few terms:\n\nFor k=1: 1\u207b\u00b9 - 2\u207b\u00b9\n\nFor k=2: 2\u207b\u00b9 - 3\u207b\u00b9\n\nFor k=3: 3\u207b\u00b9 - 4\u207b\u00b9\n\n...\n\nFor k=p-2: (p-2)\u207b\u00b9 - (p-1)\u207b\u00b9\n\nAdding all these up, the intermediate terms cancel. The sum simplifies to 1\u207b\u00b9 - (p-1)\u207b\u00b9. So, S \u2261 1\u207b\u00b9 - (p-1)\u207b\u00b9 mod p.\n\nSince we're working modulo p, 1\u207b\u00b9 is just 1. Now, what's (p-1)\u207b\u00b9 mod p? Since p-1 \u2261 -1 mod p, the inverse of -1 is also -1 because (-1)*(-1) = 1. Therefore, (p-1)\u207b\u00b9 \u2261 -1 mod p.\n\nSubstituting back into the expression for S, we get S \u2261 1 - (-1) \u2261 1 + 1 \u2261 2 mod p. \n\nWait, that seems straightforward. But let me double-check if there are any steps that might be incorrect. For example, when I converted 1/(k(k+1)) to (1/k - 1/(k+1)), does that hold in modular arithmetic? Let's take a specific example. Let p=7. Then, for k=1, 1/(1*2) = 1/2 mod 7. 1/2 mod 7 is 4. On the other hand, 1/1 - 1/2 = 1 - 4 = -3 \u2261 4 mod 7. So yes, it works here. Another example: k=2, p=7. 1/(2*3) = 1/6 \u2261 6\u207b\u00b9 mod 7. 6\u207b\u00b9 is 6, since 6*6=36\u22611 mod7. Then 1/2 -1/3 = 4 - 5 = -1 \u22616 mod7. Which matches. So the identity holds.\n\nTherefore, the telescoping works as expected. The sum S is indeed 1 - (p-1)\u207b\u00b9. Since (p-1)\u207b\u00b9 \u2261 -1 mod p, substituting gives 1 - (-1) = 2 mod p. \n\nTherefore, the sum is congruent to 2 modulo p. This holds for any prime p \u22657 (and actually, even for p=3 or 5, but the problem states p\u22657, so we don't need to check those). \n\nI think that's the proof. Let me just recap: express each term as a telescoping difference, sum them up, cancel the intermediates, and evaluate the remaining terms using modular inverses. The key insight was recognizing the telescoping nature by breaking down the product of inverses into a difference of inverses.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo evaluate the sum \\( S = \\sum_{k=1}^{p-2} \\frac{1}{k(k+1)} \\mod p \\) for a prime \\( p \\geq 7 \\), we start by rewriting each term using partial fractions. Observe that in modular arithmetic, the identity \\( \\frac{1}{k(k+1)} \\equiv \\frac{1}{k} - \\frac{1}{k+1} \\mod p \\) holds, just as it does in ordinary fractions. This is verified by expanding:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{k} - \\frac{1}{k+1} = \\frac{(k+1) - k}{k(k+1)} = \\frac{1}{k(k+1)}.\n\\]\n\nSubstituting this into the sum, we get:\n\\[\nS \\equiv \\sum_{k=1}^{p-2} \\left( \\frac{1}{k} - \\frac{1}{k+1} \\right) \\mod p.\n\\]\n\nThis is a telescoping series, where most terms cancel out:\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{1}{1} - \\frac{1}{2} \\right) + \\left( \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{3} \\right) + \\cdots + \\left( \\frac{1}{p-2} - \\frac{1}{p-1} \\right).\n\\]\n\nAfter cancellation, only the first and last terms remain:\n\\[\nS \\equiv \\frac{1}{1} - \\frac{1}{p-1} \\mod p.\n\\]\n\nSince \\( \\frac{1}{1} \\equiv 1 \\mod p \\), and \\( p-1 \\equiv -1 \\mod p \\), the inverse of \\( -1 \\) modulo \\( p \\) is \\( -1 \\) itself (because \\( (-1)(-1) = 1 \\)). Thus:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{p-1} \\equiv -1 \\mod p.\n\\]\n\nSubstituting back, we find:\n\\[\nS \\equiv 1 - (-1) \\equiv 1 + 1 \\equiv 2 \\mod p.\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the sum evaluates to \\( 2 \\mod p \\) for any prime \\( p \\geq 7 \\). The key steps are recognizing the telescoping structure of the sum and leveraging properties of modular inverses.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the mean score of all students combined from two classes with different means and a student ratio. The morning class has a mean of 84, the afternoon class a mean of 70, and the ratio of students is 3 to 4. The answer choices are given, and we need to show it's 76.\n\nFirst, I remember that when combining means of two groups, you have to take a weighted average based on the number of elements in each group. So the overall mean isn't just the average of 84 and 70, which would be 77, but that's not the case here because the class sizes are different. The ratio is 3:4, so the morning class has fewer students. Therefore, the afternoon class's lower mean will have a bigger impact, pulling the combined mean lower than 77. But the answer is 76, so how exactly does that work?\n\nLet me think. The mean of all students combined is the total sum of all scores divided by the total number of students. Let's denote the number of students in the morning class as 3k and the afternoon class as 4k, where k is some positive integer. This way, the ratio 3:4 is maintained. Then, the total sum for the morning class would be 84 multiplied by 3k, and the total sum for the afternoon class would be 70 multiplied by 4k. Adding those two sums gives the total sum for all students. The total number of students is 3k + 4k = 7k. So the combined mean would be (84*3k + 70*4k) / (7k). The k cancels out, so it's (252k + 280k)/7k = (532k)/7k = 532/7. Let me compute that: 532 divided by 7. 7*70 is 490, subtract that from 532, we get 42. 7*6 is 42, so total is 70 + 6 = 76. So that gives 76. That makes sense. \n\nWait, but maybe there's another way to see this using ratios. The problem mentions a ratio of 3/4 for the number of students. So if we think in terms of parts, the morning class contributes 3 parts and the afternoon 4 parts. Each part can be considered as a unit. Then the mean would be (3 parts * 84 + 4 parts *70) divided by 7 parts. That's the same as (3*84 +4*70)/7. Let's compute that: 3*84 is 252, 4*70 is 280. Sum is 252+280=532. 532 divided by 7 is 76. So that's the same result. \n\nAlternatively, maybe using the concept from the context given. The context had a proof about ratios and proportions, specifically that B:C = D:E when certain multiplicative conditions hold. But how does that relate here? Maybe not directly, but the idea of ratios and proportions is key here. The problem is essentially a weighted average where the weights are the number of students in each class. The ratio 3:4 tells us the weights. So the mean is a weighted average of 84 and 70 with weights 3 and 4. The formula for weighted average is (sum of (weight * value)) divided by total weight. So (3*84 +4*70)/(3+4) = 532/7=76. \n\nAnother way to think about it: if there are 3 students in the morning and 4 in the afternoon, the total score would be 3*84 +4*70=252+280=532, total students 7, mean 76. Since the ratio is 3:4, any multiple of those numbers (like 3k and 4k) would give the same result because the k cancels out. So regardless of the actual number of students, as long as the ratio is 3:4, the mean is 76. \n\nSo the key steps are: set up the problem using the ratio to express the number of students, calculate total scores for each class, sum them, divide by total students, simplify, and arrive at 76. The answer is C, 76.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo find the overall mean score of all students combined, we need to account for the different number of students in each class. The morning class has a mean score of 84, and the afternoon class has a mean score of 70, with a student ratio of 3:4. \n\nLet\u2019s represent the number of students in the morning class as \\(3k\\) and the afternoon class as \\(4k\\), where \\(k\\) is a positive integer. This maintains the ratio \\(3:4\\). The total score for the morning class is \\(84 \\times 3k = 252k\\), and the total score for the afternoon class is \\(70 \\times 4k = 280k\\). Adding these gives the combined total score: \\(252k + 280k = 532k\\). \n\nThe total number of students is \\(3k + 4k = 7k\\). The overall mean is then the total score divided by the total number of students: \n\\[\n\\frac{532k}{7k} = \\frac{532}{7} = 76.\n\\]\nThe \\(k\\) cancels out, so the result depends only on the ratio, not the actual number of students.

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this inequality: sqrt(sqrt(3 - x) - sqrt(x + 1)) > 1/2. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated with nested square roots. I need to find all real numbers x that satisfy this. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, since we have square roots, the expressions inside them must be non-negative. So, let's start by figuring out the domain where all the square roots are defined. \n\nStarting from the innermost square roots. The expression sqrt(3 - x) requires that 3 - x \u2265 0, which means x \u2264 3. Similarly, sqrt(x + 1) requires x + 1 \u2265 0, so x \u2265 -1. So combining these, x must be in the interval [-1, 3]. But there's another layer: the expression inside the outermost square root, which is sqrt(3 - x) - sqrt(x + 1), must also be non-negative. So we need sqrt(3 - x) - sqrt(x + 1) \u2265 0. Let's handle that next.\n\nSo sqrt(3 - x) \u2265 sqrt(x + 1). To eliminate the square roots, I can square both sides, but I have to be careful because squaring is only valid if both sides are non-negative, which they are here since square roots are always non-negative. Squaring both sides gives (3 - x) \u2265 (x + 1). Simplifying that: 3 - x \u2265 x + 1 \u2192 3 - 1 \u2265 x + x \u2192 2 \u2265 2x \u2192 x \u2264 1. So now, combining this with the previous domain [-1, 3], the domain is further restricted to [-1, 1].\n\nWait, but the original inequality is sqrt(...) > 1/2. So even if the expression inside the outer sqrt is non-negative, we need that outer sqrt to be greater than 1/2. Let's formalize that. Let me denote the inner expression as A = sqrt(3 - x) - sqrt(x + 1). Then the inequality becomes sqrt(A) > 1/2. For sqrt(A) to be defined, A must be \u2265 0, which we already handled (x \u2264 1). But also, since sqrt(A) > 1/2, squaring both sides (since both sides are non-negative) gives A > (1/2)^2 = 1/4. So now, we need sqrt(3 - x) - sqrt(x + 1) > 1/4.\n\nSo now the problem reduces to solving sqrt(3 - x) - sqrt(x + 1) > 1/4, with x in [-1, 1]. Let's set up this inequality: sqrt(3 - x) - sqrt(x + 1) > 1/4. To solve this, maybe isolate one of the square roots. Let's move sqrt(x + 1) to the other side: sqrt(3 - x) > sqrt(x + 1) + 1/4. Then square both sides again. But wait, when we square both sides, we have to ensure that the left side is greater than the right side, but since both sides are positive (sqrt(3 - x) is positive, and sqrt(x + 1) + 1/4 is positive), squaring should preserve the inequality. Let's proceed.\n\nLeft side squared: (sqrt(3 - x))^2 = 3 - x.\n\nRight side squared: [sqrt(x + 1) + 1/4]^2 = (sqrt(x + 1))^2 + 2*(sqrt(x + 1))*(1/4) + (1/4)^2 = (x + 1) + (1/2)sqrt(x + 1) + 1/16.\n\nSo the inequality becomes:\n\n3 - x > (x + 1) + (1/2)sqrt(x + 1) + 1/16.\n\nSimplify the left and right sides:\n\nLeft: 3 - x.\n\nRight: x + 1 + 1/16 + (1/2)sqrt(x + 1) = x + (17/16) + (1/2)sqrt(x + 1).\n\nSo subtract x + 17/16 from both sides:\n\n3 - x - x - 17/16 > (1/2)sqrt(x + 1).\n\nSimplify left side:\n\n3 - 2x - 17/16. Let's convert 3 to 48/16 to have a common denominator:\n\n48/16 - 2x - 17/16 = (48 - 17)/16 - 2x = 31/16 - 2x.\n\nSo the inequality is:\n\n31/16 - 2x > (1/2)sqrt(x + 1).\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction on the right:\n\n(31/8) - 4x > sqrt(x + 1).\n\nNow, let's denote B = sqrt(x + 1). Then, since x \u2265 -1, B is non-negative. The inequality becomes:\n\n31/8 - 4x > B.\n\nBut B = sqrt(x + 1), so substitute back:\n\n31/8 - 4x > sqrt(x + 1).\n\nBut this seems a bit messy. Maybe rearrange terms and square again. Let's move all terms to one side:\n\n31/8 - 4x - sqrt(x + 1) > 0.\n\nBut squaring here might complicate things. Alternatively, let's isolate sqrt(x + 1) first. Let's write:\n\nsqrt(x + 1) < 31/8 - 4x.\n\nNow, since sqrt(x + 1) is non-negative, the right-hand side must also be positive. So 31/8 - 4x > 0 \u2192 4x < 31/8 \u2192 x < 31/(8*4) = 31/32 \u2248 0.96875. But our domain is x \u2208 [-1, 1], so this gives x < 31/32. So we need to consider x < 31/32 in addition to the previous constraints.\n\nNow, let's square both sides again. Since both sides are positive (sqrt(x + 1) \u2265 0 and 31/8 -4x > 0 as per above), squaring preserves the inequality:\n\nx + 1 < (31/8 - 4x)^2.\n\nExpand the right-hand side:\n\n(31/8 - 4x)^2 = (31/8)^2 - 2*(31/8)*(4x) + (4x)^2 = 961/64 - (248/8)x + 16x\u00b2 = 961/64 - 31x + 16x\u00b2.\n\nSo the inequality becomes:\n\nx + 1 < 961/64 - 31x + 16x\u00b2.\n\nBring all terms to the right side:\n\n0 < 16x\u00b2 - 31x + 961/64 - x - 1.\n\nSimplify the terms:\n\n16x\u00b2 - (31x + x) + (961/64 - 1) = 16x\u00b2 - 32x + (961/64 - 64/64) = 16x\u00b2 -32x + 897/64.\n\nMultiply both sides by 64 to eliminate denominators (since 64 is positive, inequality direction remains):\n\n0 < 16*64x\u00b2 -32*64x + 897.\n\nCalculate coefficients:\n\n16*64 = 1024, 32*64=2048.\n\nSo:\n\n0 < 1024x\u00b2 -2048x + 897.\n\nDivide both sides by 1024 to simplify:\n\n0 < x\u00b2 - 2x + 897/1024.\n\nBut 897/1024 is approximately 0.875. Let me check: 1024 \u00f7 897 \u2248 1.14. Wait, 897/1024 is 897 divided by 1024. Let me compute that: 897 \u00f7 1024 \u2248 0.875. Yes, because 0.875 * 1024 = 896, so 897/1024 \u2248 0.875 + 1/1024 \u2248 0.8759765625.\n\nSo the quadratic inequality is:\n\nx\u00b2 - 2x + 0.8759765625 > 0.\n\nLet me write it as x\u00b2 - 2x + (897/1024) > 0.\n\nTo solve this quadratic inequality, find the roots of the quadratic equation x\u00b2 - 2x + 897/1024 = 0.\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n\nx = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 - 4*(1)*(897/1024))]/2.\n\nCompute discriminant D:\n\nD = 4 - (4*897)/1024 = 4 - (3588/1024) = 4 - 3.50390625 = 0.49609375.\n\nSo sqrt(D) = sqrt(0.49609375) \u2248 0.7043.\n\nTherefore, the roots are:\n\nx = [2 \u00b1 0.7043]/2.\n\nCalculating both roots:\n\nx\u2081 = (2 + 0.7043)/2 \u2248 2.7043/2 \u2248 1.35215.\n\nx\u2082 = (2 - 0.7043)/2 \u2248 1.2957/2 \u2248 0.64785.\n\nWait, but this can't be right. Because the quadratic is x\u00b2 - 2x + c, and the roots are at approximately 1.35 and 0.648. But since the quadratic opens upwards (coefficient of x\u00b2 is positive), the inequality x\u00b2 - 2x + c > 0 is satisfied when x < x\u2082 or x > x\u2081. However, our domain is x < 31/32 \u2248 0.96875. So within the domain x < 0.96875, the inequality x\u00b2 - 2x + c > 0 holds when x < x\u2082 or x > x\u2081. But x\u2081 \u22481.35 which is outside the domain (since x <0.96875). So only x < x\u2082 \u22480.648 is relevant here.\n\nWait, but x\u2082 is approximately 0.648. So the quadratic is positive when x < 0.648 or x >1.35. But since our current domain is x <0.96875, the valid interval is x <0.648. Therefore, the inequality x\u00b2 - 2x + c >0 holds for x <0.648 in the domain x <0.96875.\n\nBut wait, let's check the exact value of x\u2082. Let's compute the discriminant more accurately. Let's compute D:\n\nD = 4 - (4*897)/1024.\n\nFirst, 4*897 = 3588.\n\n3588/1024 = 3588 \u00f7 1024. Let's compute that:\n\n1024*3 = 3072, 3588 -3072=516. So 3588/1024 = 3 + 516/1024 = 3 + 129/256 \u22483.50390625.\n\nSo D =4 -3.50390625=0.49609375.\n\nsqrt(0.49609375). Let's compute this more accurately. Let's note that 0.7^2=0.49, so sqrt(0.49609375) is slightly more than 0.7. Let's compute 0.704^2:\n\n0.704*0.704 = 0.7*0.7 + 0.7*0.004*2 +0.004^2 =0.49 +0.0056 +0.000016=0.495616. Close to 0.49609375. So sqrt(0.49609375) \u22480.704 + (0.49609375 -0.495616)/(2*0.704) \u22480.704 + 0.00047775/(1.408)\u22480.704 +0.00034\u22480.70434.\n\nSo sqrt(D)\u22480.70434.\n\nThus, x\u2082=(2 -0.70434)/2\u22481.29566/2\u22480.64783.\n\nSo x\u2082\u22480.64783. Therefore, the quadratic is positive when x <0.64783 or x>1.35215. But in our current domain x <31/32\u22480.96875, so the inequality holds when x <0.64783.\n\nTherefore, combining all the previous conditions:\n\nOriginal domain after considering all square roots: x \u2208 [-1,1].\n\nThen, after considering the inequality sqrt(A) >1/2 leading to A>1/4, and solving the subsequent inequalities, we found that x must be <0.64783 approximately. But we need to express this exactly. Let's see, the exact roots are:\n\nx = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 - 4*(897/1024))]/2.\n\nWait, let's compute the exact value. Let's write the quadratic equation again:\n\nAfter multiplying by 64, we had 1024x\u00b2 -2048x +897=0.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to work with fractions. Let's go back to the quadratic equation before multiplying by 64.\n\nWe had:\n\n16x\u00b2 -32x +897/64 >0.\n\nMultiply both sides by 64:\n\n1024x\u00b2 -2048x +897 >0.\n\nSo the quadratic equation is 1024x\u00b2 -2048x +897=0.\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n\nx = [2048 \u00b1 sqrt(2048\u00b2 -4*1024*897)]/(2*1024).\n\nCompute discriminant:\n\n\u0394 = (2048)^2 -4*1024*897.\n\nFirst, compute 2048\u00b2: 2048*2048. Since 2048=2^11, so 2048\u00b2=2^22=4,194,304.\n\nThen compute 4*1024*897: 4*1024=4096; 4096*897.\n\nCompute 4096*897:\n\nLet's compute 4096*900=3,686,400. Then subtract 4096*3=12,288.\n\nSo 3,686,400 -12,288=3,674,112.\n\nThus, \u0394=4,194,304 -3,674,112=520,192.\n\nSo sqrt(\u0394)=sqrt(520,192). Let's see:\n\n720\u00b2=518,400. 721\u00b2=518,400+1441=519,841. 722\u00b2=519,841+1443=521,284. So sqrt(520,192) is between 721 and 722. Let's compute 721.5\u00b2:\n\n721.5\u00b2 = (721 +0.5)^2=721\u00b2 +2*721*0.5 +0.25=519,841 +721 +0.25=520,562.25. Which is larger than 520,192. So sqrt(520,192) is between 721 and 721.5.\n\nCompute 721.3\u00b2:\n\n721.3\u00b2 = (720 +1.3)^2=720\u00b2 +2*720*1.3 +1.3\u00b2=518,400 +1,872 +1.69=520,273.69. Still larger.\n\n721.2\u00b2=720\u00b2 +2*720*1.2 +1.44=518,400 +1,728 +1.44=520,129.44.\n\nCloser. 721.2\u00b2=520,129.44. Our \u0394=520,192. Difference is 520,192 -520,129.44=62.56. Each 0.1 increase in x adds approximately 2*721.2*0.1 +0.1\u00b2\u2248144.24 +0.01\u2248144.25. So 62.56 /144.25\u22480.433. So sqrt(\u0394)=721.2 +0.433\u2248721.633. So approximately 721.633.\n\nThus, x=(2048 \u00b1721.633)/2048.\n\nCompute both roots:\n\nx\u2081=(2048 +721.633)/2048\u22482769.633/2048\u22481.352.\n\nx\u2082=(2048 -721.633)/2048\u22481326.367/2048\u22480.6478.\n\nSo the exact roots are (2048 \u00b1 sqrt(520192))/2048. But sqrt(520192)=sqrt(520192). Let's see if 520192 can be simplified. Let's factor it:\n\n520192 \u00f7 16=32,512. 32,512 \u00f716=2,032. 2,032 \u00f716=127. So 520192=16*16*16*127=16\u00b3*127=4096*127. Therefore, sqrt(520192)=sqrt(4096*127)=64*sqrt(127).\n\nTherefore, sqrt(\u0394)=64\u221a127.\n\nThus, the roots are:\n\nx=(2048 \u00b164\u221a127)/(2*1024)= (2048 \u00b164\u221a127)/2048= [2048/2048] \u00b1 [64\u221a127/2048]=1 \u00b1 (\u221a127)/32.\n\nTherefore, the roots are x=1 + (\u221a127)/32 and x=1 - (\u221a127)/32.\n\nBut since we have x <31/32\u22480.96875, and 1 - (\u221a127)/32 is approximately 1 - (11.269)/32\u22481 -0.352\u22480.648, which matches our earlier approximation. The other root is 1 + (\u221a127)/32\u22481.352, which is outside our domain.\n\nTherefore, the quadratic inequality 1024x\u00b2 -2048x +897 >0 holds when x <1 - (\u221a127)/32 or x >1 + (\u221a127)/32. But in our current domain x <31/32\u22480.96875, only x <1 - (\u221a127)/32 is relevant.\n\nTherefore, combining all the conditions:\n\n1. Original domain for square roots: x \u2208 [-1,1].\n\n2. After requiring sqrt(3 -x) - sqrt(x +1) >1/4, we derived that x must be <1 - (\u221a127)/32.\n\nBut we also need to remember that when we squared the inequality sqrt(x +1) <31/8 -4x, we had to ensure that 31/8 -4x >0, which gave x <31/32\u22480.96875. However, since 1 - (\u221a127)/32\u22480.647, which is less than 31/32\u22480.96875, the condition x <1 -\u221a127/32 automatically satisfies x <31/32. Therefore, the final solution is x \u2208 [-1,1 -\u221a127/32).\n\nWait, but we need to check if there are any other constraints. Let's verify with x approaching -1.\n\nAt x=-1: sqrt(3 -(-1))=sqrt(4)=2, sqrt(-1 +1)=sqrt(0)=0. So sqrt(2 -0)=sqrt(2)\u22481.414",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how many integers are in the solution set of |x - 2| \u2264 5.6 and show that there are exactly 11 integers. Let me start by understanding what this inequality means.\n\nThe absolute value inequality |x - 2| \u2264 5.6 means that the distance between x and 2 on the number line is at most 5.6. So, x can be anywhere from 2 - 5.6 to 2 + 5.6. Let me calculate those bounds.\n\nFirst, 2 - 5.6 is -3.6, and 2 + 5.6 is 7.6. So the solution set is all real numbers x such that -3.6 \u2264 x \u2264 7.6. But the question is about integers in this interval. So I need to find all integers greater than or equal to -3.6 and less than or equal to 7.6.\n\nWait, but integers are whole numbers. So the smallest integer greater than or equal to -3.6 is -3, because -3.6 is between -4 and -3, and since we need x \u2265 -3.6, the first integer is -3. Similarly, the largest integer less than or equal to 7.6 is 7. So the integers in the solution set are from -3 up to 7, inclusive.\n\nNow I need to list those integers to count them. Let's see: starting at -3, then -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Let me count them. That's -3, -2, -1, 0 (four numbers), then 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 (seven numbers). Wait, 4 + 7 is 11. So that's 11 integers.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check if the endpoints are included. The original inequality is \u2264 5.6, so x can be exactly -3.6 or 7.6. But since we're looking for integers, and integers can't be -3.6 or 7.6, we just take the integers strictly between those, but actually, the interval is inclusive. So even though the endpoints are not integers, the integers within the interval are from the smallest integer greater than or equal to -3.6 (which is -3) to the largest integer less than or equal to 7.6 (which is 7). So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to count the integers between two numbers is to take the floor of the upper bound minus the ceiling of the lower bound plus 1. Let me verify that. The lower bound is -3.6, so the ceiling of that is -3. The upper bound is 7.6, so the floor is 7. Then the number of integers is 7 - (-3) + 1 = 7 + 3 + 1 = 11. That matches the count I did earlier.\n\nSo both methods give 11 integers. Therefore, the solution set contains exactly 11 integers.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo determine how many integers satisfy the inequality \\( |x - 2| \\leq 5.6 \\), we first interpret the inequality geometrically: \\( x \\) must lie within a distance of \\( 5.6 \\) units from \\( 2 \\) on the number line. This translates to the interval:\n\n\\[\n2 - 5.6 \\leq x \\leq 2 + 5.6,\n\\]\n\nwhich simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n-3.6 \\leq x \\leq 7.6.\n\\]\n\nWe now seek all **integer** values within this range.

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to expand (x + 3)(2x - 6) and show that it equals 2x\u00b2 - 18. Hmm, how do I approach this?\n\nAlright, expanding two binomials. I remember from algebra that you use the distributive property, right? Like, each term in the first parenthesis gets multiplied by each term in the second. So, maybe I should use the FOIL method here. FOIL stands for First, Outer, Inner, Last. Let me try that.\n\nFirst terms: x multiplied by 2x. That would be 2x\u00b2. Okay, that's the first part. Then Outer terms: x times -6. That gives -6x. Next, Inner terms: 3 times 2x. That's 6x. Lastly, Last terms: 3 times -6, which is -18. So adding all those up: 2x\u00b2 -6x +6x -18. Wait, the middle terms are -6x and +6x. They should cancel each other out, right? So -6x +6x is 0. That leaves me with 2x\u00b2 -18. That matches what the problem says. But wait, maybe I should check if there's another way to do this, just to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the distributive property step by step without FOIL. Let's see. Take (x + 3) and distribute it over (2x -6). So, (x +3)*2x + (x +3)*(-6). Then distribute each part. For the first part: x*2x = 2x\u00b2, and 3*2x =6x. For the second part: x*(-6) = -6x, and 3*(-6) = -18. Combine all terms: 2x\u00b2 +6x -6x -18. Again, the 6x and -6x cancel, leaving 2x\u00b2 -18. Same result. So both methods give the same answer. That makes sense. \n\nWait, maybe there's a shortcut here. If I notice that (2x -6) can be factored as 2(x -3). Let's check: 2x -6 = 2(x) -2*3 = 2(x -3). So then the original expression becomes (x +3)*2(x -3). Then, maybe rearrange the multiplication: 2*(x +3)*(x -3). Now, (x +3)(x -3) is a difference of squares, right? So that's x\u00b2 -9. Then multiply by 2: 2*(x\u00b2 -9) = 2x\u00b2 -18. Oh, that's a quicker way! So using factoring and the difference of squares formula simplifies the process. But since the problem just asks to expand, either method works. But the key steps are distributing each term and combining like terms. \n\nLet me verify once more. Using the distributive property (a + b)(c + d) = ac + ad + bc + bd. Here, a = x, b =3, c=2x, d=-6. So ac = x*2x =2x\u00b2, ad =x*(-6)=-6x, bc=3*2x=6x, bd=3*(-6)=-18. Adding them: 2x\u00b2 -6x +6x -18. The middle terms cancel, so 2x\u00b2 -18. Yep, that's correct. \n\nI think that's solid. The main thing is to ensure that all terms are multiplied correctly and that like terms are combined. The cancellation of the middle terms is crucial here, leading directly to the simplified form. So the expansion definitely results in 2x\u00b2 -18.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo expand \\((x + 3)(2x - 6)\\), we use the distributive property (also known as the FOIL method for binomials). Here's how it works step-by-step:\n\n1. **Multiply the First terms**:  \n   \\(x \\cdot 2x = 2x^2\\).\n\n2. **Multiply the Outer terms**:  \n   \\(x \\cdot (-6) = -6x\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the Inner terms**:  \n   \\(3 \\cdot 2x = 6x\\).\n\n4. **Multiply the Last terms**:  \n   \\(3 \\cdot (-6) = -18\\).\n\nNow, add all these results together:  \n\\[\n2x^2 - 6x + 6x - 18.\n\\]\n\nNotice that the \\(-6x\\) and \\(+6x\\) cancel each other out (they sum to \\(0\\)). This simplifies the expression to:  \n\\[\n2x^2 - 18.\n\\]\n\n**Alternative approach**:  \nFactor \\(2x - 6\\) as \\(2(x - 3)\\). The original expression becomes:  \n\\[\n(x + 3) \\cdot 2(x - 3) = 2(x + 3)(x - 3).\n\\]  \nRecognize that \\((x + 3)(x - 3)\\) is a **difference of squares**:  \n\\[\n(x + 3)(x - 3) = x^2 - 9.\n\\]  \nMultiply by \\(2\\):  \n\\[\n2(x^2 - 9) = 2x^2 - 18.\n\\]\n\nEither method confirms that \\((x + 3)(2x - 6)\\) simplifies to \\(2x^2 - 18\\). The key idea is combining like terms after distribution or leveraging factoring shortcuts.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question gives us a chain of exponential equations and asks for the product of a, b, c, d, which should be 3/2. Let me see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's write down the given equations:\n\n4^a = 5  \n5^b = 6  \n6^c = 7  \n7^d = 8  \n\nWe need to find a\u00b7b\u00b7c\u00b7d. Hmm, since each equation involves exponents, maybe taking logarithms would help here. Logarithms can turn exponents into multipliers, which might make it easier to solve for each variable and then multiply them together.\n\nLet's start with the first equation: 4^a = 5. Taking the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides gives:\n\nln(4^a) = ln(5)  \nUsing the logarithm power rule, ln(x^y) = y\u00b7ln(x), so:\n\na\u00b7ln(4) = ln(5)  \nTherefore, a = ln(5)/ln(4)\n\nSimilarly, for the second equation: 5^b = 6  \nTake ln of both sides:\n\nb\u00b7ln(5) = ln(6)  \nSo, b = ln(6)/ln(5)\n\nThird equation: 6^c = 7  \nSame process:\n\nc\u00b7ln(6) = ln(7)  \nc = ln(7)/ln(6)\n\nFourth equation: 7^d = 8  \nAgain:\n\nd\u00b7ln(7) = ln(8)  \nd = ln(8)/ln(7)\n\nNow, let's compute the product a\u00b7b\u00b7c\u00b7d. Substitute each expression:\n\na\u00b7b\u00b7c\u00b7d = [ln(5)/ln(4)] \u00b7 [ln(6)/ln(5)] \u00b7 [ln(7)/ln(6)] \u00b7 [ln(8)/ln(7)]\n\nLooking at this product, I notice a telescoping effect. The ln(5) in the numerator cancels with the ln(5) in the denominator of the next term. Similarly, ln(6) cancels, and ln(7) cancels. Let's verify:\n\nFirst term: ln(5)/ln(4)  \nSecond term: ln(6)/ln(5) \u2192 ln(5) cancels  \nThird term: ln(7)/ln(6) \u2192 ln(6) cancels  \nFourth term: ln(8)/ln(7) \u2192 ln(7) cancels  \n\nWhat's left is ln(8)/ln(4). So the entire product simplifies to ln(8)/ln(4).\n\nNow, let's compute ln(8)/ln(4). Let's express 8 and 4 as powers of 2: 8 = 2^3 and 4 = 2^2.\n\nSo ln(8) = ln(2^3) = 3\u00b7ln(2)  \nln(4) = ln(2^2) = 2\u00b7ln(2)  \n\nTherefore, ln(8)/ln(4) = (3\u00b7ln(2))/(2\u00b7ln(2)) = 3/2.\n\nHence, the product a\u00b7b\u00b7c\u00b7d equals 3/2. That matches the value we were supposed to show. Let me check each step again to make sure there's no mistake. The key steps were taking logarithms to solve for each variable and recognizing the telescoping product. All the intermediate terms cancel out correctly, leaving us with the ratio of the first and last logarithms, which simplifies neatly using the same base. Yep, that all checks out.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nWe start with the given equations involving exponents:  \n\\(4^{a} = 5\\), \\(5^{b} = 6\\), \\(6^{c} = 7\\), and \\(7^{d} = 8\\).  \n\nTo solve for \\(a, b, c, d\\), we take the natural logarithm (\\(\\ln\\)) of both sides of each equation. For the first equation:  \n\\[\n\\ln(4^a) = \\ln(5) \\implies a \\cdot \\ln(4) = \\ln(5) \\implies a = \\frac{\\ln(5)}{\\ln(4)}.\n\\]  \nSimilarly, for the remaining equations:  \n\\[\nb = \\frac{\\ln(6)}{\\ln(5)}, \\quad c = \\frac{\\ln(7)}{\\ln(6)}, \\quad d = \\frac{\\ln(8)}{\\ln(7)}.\n\\]  \n\nNow, compute the product \\(a \\cdot b \\cdot c \\cdot d\\):  \n\\[\na \\cdot b \\cdot c \\cdot d = \\left(\\frac{\\ln(5)}{\\ln(4)}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{\\ln(6)}{\\ln(5)}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{\\ln(7)}{\\ln(6)}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{\\ln(8)}{\\ln(7)}\\right).\n\\]  \n\nNotice that this product \"telescopes\": intermediate terms cancel out. For example, \\(\\ln(5)\\) in the numerator of \\(a\\) cancels with \\(\\ln(5)\\) in the denominator of \\(b\\), and so on. This simplifies to:  \n\\[\n\\frac{\\ln(8)}{\\ln(4)}.\n\\]  \n\nExpress \\(8\\) and \\(4\\) as powers of \\(2\\): \\(8 = 2^3\\) and \\(4 = 2^2\\). Using logarithm properties:  \n\\[\n\\ln(8) = \\ln(2^3) = 3\\ln(2), \\quad \\ln(4) = \\ln(2^2) = 2\\ln(2).\n\\]  \nThus:  \n\\[\n\\frac{\\ln(8)}{\\ln(4)} = \\frac{3\\ln(2)}{2\\ln(2)} = \\frac{3}{2}.\n\\]  \n\nTherefore, \\(a \\cdot b \\cdot c \\cdot d = \\frac{3}{2}\\), as required.\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  log_rpow ?m.839\nargument\n  ?m.839\nhas

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, we need to show that for positive real numbers a and b where b \u2264 a, the expression (a + b)/2 minus the square root of ab is less than or equal to (a - b)\u00b2 divided by 8b. Hmm, this looks like it's related to the arithmetic mean and geometric mean inequality, but with an extra term. Let me think.\n\nFirst, I remember that the arithmetic mean (AM) of a and b is (a + b)/2, and the geometric mean (GM) is \u221a(ab). The AM-GM inequality tells us that AM \u2265 GM, so (a + b)/2 - \u221a(ab) is non-negative. But here, we need to bound this difference by (a - b)\u00b2/(8b). So maybe we can express the difference in terms of (a - b)\u00b2 and manipulate the inequality.\n\nGiven that b \u2264 a, maybe it's helpful to set a = b + d where d is non-negative. Wait, but maybe there's a better substitution. Alternatively, since b is positive and a \u2265 b, perhaps we can divide both sides by b to normalize the variables. Let me try that. Let\u2019s set t = a/b, so since a \u2265 b > 0, t \u2265 1. Then, substituting a = tb, the left-hand side (LHS) becomes (tb + b)/2 - \u221a(tb * b) = (t + 1)b/2 - b\u221at. The right-hand side (RHS) is (tb - b)\u00b2/(8b) = (b(t - 1))\u00b2/(8b) = b\u00b2(t - 1)\u00b2/(8b) = b(t - 1)\u00b2/8.\n\nSo the inequality becomes [(t + 1)/2 - \u221at]b \u2264 [ (t - 1)\u00b2 /8 ]b. Since b is positive, we can divide both sides by b, which simplifies the inequality to (t + 1)/2 - \u221at \u2264 (t - 1)\u00b2 /8. Now, the problem is reduced to showing this inequality holds for t \u2265 1. That seems more manageable.\n\nLet me denote the left side as L = (t + 1)/2 - \u221at and the right side as R = (t - 1)^2 /8. Let's compute L - R and see if it's \u2264 0. So L - R = [(t + 1)/2 - \u221at] - [(t - 1)^2 /8]. Let's expand (t - 1)^2: that's t\u00b2 - 2t + 1. So R = (t\u00b2 - 2t + 1)/8. Then L - R becomes (t + 1)/2 - \u221at - (t\u00b2 - 2t + 1)/8. Let's combine the terms. To combine fractions, let's get a common denominator. The first term is (t + 1)/2 = 4(t + 1)/8, and the third term is (t\u00b2 - 2t + 1)/8. So:\n\n4(t + 1)/8 - \u221at - (t\u00b2 - 2t + 1)/8 = [4(t + 1) - (t\u00b2 - 2t + 1)]/8 - \u221at.\n\nCalculating the numerator: 4t + 4 - t\u00b2 + 2t -1 = -t\u00b2 + 6t +3. So L - R = (-t\u00b2 +6t +3)/8 - \u221at. Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe there's a better approach.\n\nAlternatively, let's square both sides of the original inequality. Wait, but squaring can introduce extraneous solutions, so maybe not the best idea. Alternatively, let's consider expanding (\u221aa - \u221ab)^2, which is a - 2\u221a(ab) + b. Then, (a + b)/2 - \u221a(ab) = (a + b)/2 - (a + b)/2 + (\u221aa - \u221ab)^2 /2. Wait, let me check that. Let's compute (\u221aa - \u221ab)^2 = a - 2\u221a(ab) + b. So (\u221aa - \u221ab)^2 /2 = (a + b)/2 - \u221a(ab). Therefore, (a + b)/2 - \u221a(ab) = (\u221aa - \u221ab)^2 /2. So the left-hand side of the original inequality is (\u221aa - \u221ab)^2 /2. So the inequality becomes (\u221aa - \u221ab)^2 /2 \u2264 (a - b)^2 / (8b).\n\nMultiply both sides by 2: (\u221aa - \u221ab)^2 \u2264 (a - b)^2 / (4b). Let's express (a - b)^2 as (\u221aa - \u221ab)^2 (\u221aa + \u221ab)^2. Because (a - b) = (\u221aa - \u221ab)(\u221aa + \u221ab), so (a - b)^2 = (\u221aa - \u221ab)^2 (\u221aa + \u221ab)^2. Therefore, substituting into the inequality:\n\n(\u221aa - \u221ab)^2 \u2264 [ (\u221aa - \u221ab)^2 (\u221aa + \u221ab)^2 ] / (4b )\n\nAssuming \u221aa - \u221ab \u2260 0 (if they are equal, then both sides are zero, so equality holds), we can divide both sides by (\u221aa - \u221ab)^2, which is positive since squares are non-negative. So we get 1 \u2264 ( (\u221aa + \u221ab)^2 ) / (4b )\n\nMultiply both sides by 4b: 4b \u2264 (\u221aa + \u221ab)^2. Expand the right side: (\u221aa)^2 + 2\u221aa\u221ab + (\u221ab)^2 = a + 2\u221a(ab) + b. So 4b \u2264 a + 2\u221a(ab) + b. Simplify: 4b - b \u2264 a + 2\u221a(ab) \u2192 3b \u2264 a + 2\u221a(ab). Since a \u2265 b, let's see if this holds. Let's rearrange: a - 3b + 2\u221a(ab) \u2265 0. Hmm, not sure. Maybe this approach isn't the best.\n\nAlternatively, let's go back to the substitution t = a/b \u22651. Then, the inequality (\u221aa - \u221ab)^2 /2 \u2264 (a - b)^2 / (8b) becomes, after substituting a = tb:\n\n(\u221a(tb) - \u221ab)^2 /2 \u2264 (tb - b)^2 / (8b)\n\nSimplify left side: [\u221ab (\u221at -1)]^2 /2 = b (\u221at -1)^2 /2\n\nRight side: [b(t -1)]^2 / (8b) = b\u00b2(t -1)^2 / (8b) = b(t -1)^2 /8\n\nSo the inequality becomes [b (\u221at -1)^2 ] /2 \u2264 [b (t -1)^2 ] /8\n\nDivide both sides by b (since b >0): (\u221at -1)^2 /2 \u2264 (t -1)^2 /8\n\nMultiply both sides by 8: 4(\u221at -1)^2 \u2264 (t -1)^2\n\nLet\u2019s expand both sides. Left side: 4( t - 2\u221at +1 )\n\nRight side: t\u00b2 - 2t +1\n\nSo inequality: 4t -8\u221at +4 \u2264 t\u00b2 -2t +1\n\nBring all terms to right side: 0 \u2264 t\u00b2 -2t +1 -4t +8\u221at -4 \u2192 t\u00b2 -6t -3 +8\u221at \u22650\n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Maybe there's a better substitution. Let\u2019s set s = \u221at, so s \u22651 since t \u22651. Then t = s\u00b2. Substitute into the inequality:\n\n4(s -1)^2 \u2264 (s\u00b2 -1)^2\n\nExpand left: 4(s\u00b2 -2s +1) =4s\u00b2 -8s +4\n\nRight: (s\u00b2 -1)^2 = s^4 -2s\u00b2 +1\n\nSo inequality becomes 4s\u00b2 -8s +4 \u2264 s^4 -2s\u00b2 +1\n\nBring all terms to left: s^4 -2s\u00b2 +1 -4s\u00b2 +8s -4 \u22650 \u2192 s^4 -6s\u00b2 +8s -3 \u22650\n\nThis quartic equation might factor. Let me try to factor it. Let\u2019s look for rational roots. Possible roots are \u00b11, \u00b13. Testing s=1: 1 -6 +8 -3=0. So s=1 is a root. Then factor (s-1). Use polynomial division or synthetic division.\n\nDivide s^4 -6s\u00b2 +8s -3 by (s -1):\n\nCoefficients: 1 (s^4), 0 (s^3), -6 (s\u00b2), 8 (s), -3 (constant)\n\nUsing synthetic division with root 1:\n\nBring down 1. Multiply by 1: 1. Add to next term: 0 +1=1. Multiply by1:1. Add to next term: -6 +1=-5. Multiply by1: -5. Add to next term:8 + (-5)=3. Multiply by1:3. Add to last term: -3 +3=0. So the polynomial factors as (s -1)(s^3 +s\u00b2 -5s +3). Now factor the cubic.\n\nTry s=1 again in the cubic: 1 +1 -5 +3=0. So s=1 is another root. Factor out (s -1) again.\n\nDivide s^3 +s\u00b2 -5s +3 by (s -1):\n\nCoefficients:1,1,-5,3\n\nSynthetic division with root1:\n\nBring down 1. Multiply by1:1. Add to next term:1+1=2. Multiply by1:2. Add to next term: -5+2=-3. Multiply by1:-3. Add to last term:3 + (-3)=0. So cubic factors as (s -1)(s\u00b2 +2s -3). Now factor the quadratic: s\u00b2 +2s -3. Discriminant:4 +12=16. Roots: (-2 \u00b14)/2 \u2192 1 and -3. So s\u00b2 +2s -3=(s -1)(s +3). Therefore, the quartic factors as (s -1)^3 (s +3). So s^4 -6s\u00b2 +8s -3=(s -1)^3 (s +3). Since s \u22651, s +3 >0, and (s -1)^3 \u22650 because s \u22651. Therefore, the quartic is non-negative for s \u22651. Hence, the inequality 4(\u221at -1)^2 \u2264 (t -1)^2 holds for t \u22651. Therefore, the original inequality holds.\n\nSo putting it all together, by substituting t = a/b, reducing the inequality to a function of t, and factoring the resulting polynomial, we show that the inequality holds for all t \u22651, which corresponds to a \u2265b >0. Therefore, the original statement is true.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nLet's start by recalling that we need to show for positive real numbers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) with \\( b \\leq a \\), the inequality:\n\\[\n\\frac{a + b}{2} - \\sqrt{ab} \\leq \\frac{(a - b)^2}{8b}\n\\]\nholds. \n\n**Step 1: Simplify using substitution**  \nSince \\( a \\geq b > 0 \\), let \\( t = \\frac{a}{b} \\). This substitution simplifies the problem because \\( t \\geq 1 \\). Rewrite \\( a = tb \\), and substitute into the inequality. The left-hand side (LHS) becomes:\n\\[\n\\frac{tb + b}{2} - \\sqrt{tb \\cdot b} = \\frac{(t + 1)b}{2} - b\\sqrt{t}.\n\\]\nThe right-hand side (RHS) becomes:\n\\[\n\\frac{(tb - b)^2}{8b} = \\frac{b^2(t - 1)^2}{8b} = \\frac{b(t - 1)^2}{8}.\n\\]\nDivide both sides by \\( b \\) (since \\( b > 0 \\)) to normalize the inequality:\n\\[\n\\frac{t + 1}{2} - \\sqrt{t} \\leq \\frac{(t - 1)^2}{8}.\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Recognize a key identity**  \nNotice that \\( \\frac{t + 1}{2} - \\sqrt{t} \\) is the difference between the arithmetic mean (AM) and geometric mean (GM) of \\( t \\) and \\( 1 \\). By the AM-GM inequality, this difference is non-negative. Our goal is to bound it by \\( \\frac{(t - 1)^2}{8} \\).\n\n**Step 3: Expand and compare both sides**  \nMultiply both sides by 8 to eliminate denominators:\n\\[\n4(t + 1) - 8\\sqrt{t} \\leq (t - 1)^2.\n\\]\nExpand \\( (t - 1)^2 = t^2 - 2t + 1 \\), and rearrange all terms to one side:\n\\[\nt^2 - 6t + 3 + 8\\sqrt{t} \\geq 0.\n\\]\nThis looks complex, but we can simplify further by substituting \\( s = \\sqrt{t} \\) (since \\( t \\geq 1 \\), \\( s \\geq 1 \\)). Let \\( t = s^2 \\), and substitute:\n\\[\ns^4 - 6s^2 + 3 + 8s \\geq 0.\n\\]\nFactor the polynomial (details omitted here for brevity, but verified through algebraic manipulation):\n\\[\n(s - 1)^3(s + 3) \\geq 0.\n\\]\nSince \\( s \\geq 1 \\), both \\( (s - 1)^3 \\geq 0 \\) and \\( (s + 3) > 0 \\). Thus, the inequality holds for all \\( s \\geq 1 \\), which corresponds to \\( t \\geq 1 \\).\n\n**Conclusion**  \nThe inequality \\( \\frac{a + b}{2} - \\sqrt{ab} \\leq \\frac{(a - b)^2}{8b} \\) holds for all \\( a \\geq b > 0 \\). The substitution \\( t = \\frac{a}{b} \\) reduces the problem to a function of \\( t \\geq 1 \\), and algebraic manipulation confirms the inequality\u2019s validity in this range.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is to factor the quadratic expression 10x\u00b2 - x - 24 into the form (Ax - 8)(Bx + 3), where A and B are integers. Then we need to find AB + B and show that it's equal to 12.\n\nFirst, I remember that factoring a quadratic of the form ax\u00b2 + bx + c involves finding two binomials that multiply to give the original quadratic. In this case, the quadratic is 10x\u00b2 - x -24. The given form is (Ax - 8)(Bx + 3). So, when we multiply these two binomials, we should get back the original expression.\n\nLet me start by expanding (Ax - 8)(Bx + 3). Using the distributive property (FOIL method):\n\nFirst terms: Ax * Bx = ABx\u00b2\nOuter terms: Ax * 3 = 3Ax\nInner terms: -8 * Bx = -8Bx\nLast terms: -8 * 3 = -24\n\nCombine these terms:\nABx\u00b2 + (3A - 8B)x - 24\n\nNow, this should equal the original quadratic 10x\u00b2 - x -24. So, we can set up equations by equating the coefficients of corresponding terms.\n\n1. Coefficient of x\u00b2: AB = 10\n2. Coefficient of x: 3A - 8B = -1\n3. Constant term: -24 (which already matches, so that's confirmed)\n\nSo, the key equations are AB = 10 and 3A - 8B = -1. We need to find integers A and B that satisfy both equations.\n\nSince A and B are integers and their product is 10, let's list the pairs of integers (A, B) that multiply to 10. Considering both positive and negative factors:\n\nPossible pairs (A, B):\n(1, 10), (2, 5), (5, 2), (10, 1), (-1, -10), (-2, -5), (-5, -2), (-10, -1)\n\nNow, we need to test these pairs in the second equation 3A - 8B = -1.\n\nLet's check each pair:\n\n1. (1,10): 3*1 -8*10 = 3 -80 = -77 \u2260 -1\n2. (2,5): 3*2 -8*5 = 6 -40 = -34 \u2260 -1\n3. (5,2): 3*5 -8*2 =15 -16 = -1 \u2192 This works!\n4. (10,1): 3*10 -8*1 =30 -8=22 \u2260 -1\n5. (-1,-10): 3*(-1) -8*(-10)= -3 +80=77 \u2260 -1\n6. (-2,-5): 3*(-2) -8*(-5)= -6 +40=34 \u2260 -1\n7. (-5,-2): 3*(-5) -8*(-2)= -15 +16=1 \u2260 -1\n8. (-10,-1): 3*(-10) -8*(-1)= -30 +8= -22 \u2260 -1\n\nOnly the pair (5,2) satisfies the second equation. So A=5 and B=2.\n\nNow, compute AB + B. AB is 5*2=10, then add B which is 2: 10 +2=12. Therefore, AB + B=12, as required.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this without testing all pairs. Let's see. From AB=10, we can express A=10/B (assuming B divides 10). Then substitute into the second equation:\n\n3*(10/B) -8B = -1 \u2192 30/B -8B = -1. Multiply both sides by B to eliminate denominator:\n\n30 -8B\u00b2 = -B \u2192 8B\u00b2 - B -30=0. Then solve this quadratic for B. Let's see if this gives integer solutions.\n\nUsing quadratic formula: B = [1 \u00b1 \u221a(1 + 960)] / (16) = [1 \u00b1 \u221a961]/16 = [1 \u00b131]/16. So possible B=(1+31)/16=32/16=2 or B=(1-31)/16=-30/16=-15/8. Since B must be integer, only B=2 is valid. Then A=10/2=5. So same result. Therefore, AB + B=5*2 +2=12.\n\nEither way, the answer is 12.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo factor \\(10x^2 - x - 24\\) into the form \\((Ax - 8)(Bx + 3)\\), we start by expanding the product \\((Ax - 8)(Bx + 3)\\). Using the distributive property (FOIL method), this gives:\n\n\\[\nABx^2 + (3A - 8B)x - 24.\n\\]\n\nThis must equal the original quadratic \\(10x^2 - x - 24\\). By comparing coefficients, we derive two key equations:\n1. \\(AB = 10\\) (from the \\(x^2\\) term),\n2. \\(3A - 8B = -1\\) (from the \\(x\\) term).\n\nWe need integer solutions \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) that satisfy both equations.

Finally, compute \\(AB + B\\):\n\\[\nAB + B = (5 \\times 2) + 2 = 10 + 2 = 12.\n\\]\n\nThis confirms that \\(AB + B = 12\\), as required. The factorization is \\((5x - 8)(2x + 3)\\), and substituting back verifies the original quadratic.\nPrevious attempt failed with: linarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase h1.h\na b : \u2124\nh\u2080 : \u2200 (x : \u211d), 10 * x ^ 2 - x - 24 = (\u2191a * x - 8) * (\u2191b * x + 3)\nh\u2081 : 10 * 1 ^ 2 - 1 - 24 = (\u2191a * 1 - 8) * (\u2191b * 1 + 3)\nh\u2082 : 10 * 0 ^ 2 - 0 - 24 = (\u2191a * 0 - 8) * (\u2191b * 0 + 3)\nh\u2083 : 10 * (-1) ^ 2 - -1 - 24 = (\u2191a * -1 - 8) * (\u2191b * -1 + 3)\nh\u2084 : 10 * (-2) ^ 2 - -2 - 24 = (\u2191a * -2 - 8) * (\u2191b * -2 + 3)\nh\u2085 : 10 * 2 ^ 2 - 2 - 24 = (\u2191a * 2 - 8) * (\u2191b * 2 + 3)\nh\u2086 : 10 * (-3) ^ 2 - -3 - 24 = (\u2191a * -3 - 8) * (\u2191b * -3 + 3)\nh\u2087 : 10 * 3 ^ 2 - 3 - 24 = (\u2191a * 3 - 8) * (\u2191b * 3 + 3)\nh\u2088 : 10 * (-4) ^ 2 - -4 - 24 = (\u2191a * -4 - 8) * (\u2191b * -4 + 3)\nh\u2089 : 10 * 4 ^ 2 - 4 - 24 = (\u2191a * 4 - 8) * (\u2191b * 4 + 3)\nh\u2081\u2080 : 10 * (-5) ^ 2 - -5 - 24 = (\u2191a * -5 - 8) * (\u2191b * -5 + 3)\nh\u2081\u2081 : 10 * 5 ^ 2 - 5 - 24 = (\u2191a * 5 - 8) * (\u2191b * 5 + 3)\nh\u2081\u2082 : 10 * (-6) ^ 2 - -6 - 24 = (\u2191a * -6 - 8) * (\u2191b * -6 + 3)\nh\u2081\u2083 : 10 * 6 ^ 2 - 6 - 24 = (\u2191a * 6 - 8) * (\u2191b * 6 + 3)\nh\u2081\u2084 : 10 * (-7) ^ 2 - -7 - 24 = (\u2191a * -7 - 8) * (\u2191b * -7 + 3)\nh\u2081\u2085 : 10 * 7 ^ 2 - 7 - 24 = (\u2191a * 7 - 8) * (\u2191b * 7 + 3)\nh\u2081\u2086 : 10 * (-8) ^ 2 - -8 - 24 = (\u2191a * -8 - 8) * (\u2191b * -8 + 3)\nh\u2081\u2087 : 10 * 8 ^ 2 - 8 - 24 = (\u2191a * 8 - 8) * (\u2191b * 8 + 3)\nh\u2081\u2088 : 10 * (-9) ^ 2 - -9 - 24 = (\u2191a * -9 - 8) * (\u2191b * -9 + 3)\nh\u2081\u2089 : 10 * 9 ^ 2 - 9 - 24 = (\u2191a * 9 - 8) * (\u2191b * 9 + 3)\nh\u2082\u2080 : 10 * (-10) ^ 2 - -10 - 24 = (\u2191a * -10 - 8) * (\u2191b * -10 + 3)\nh\u2082\u2081 : 10 * 10 ^ 2 - 10 - 24 = (\u2191a * 10 - 8) * (\u2191b * 10 + 3)\na\u271d : a * b + b < 12\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: linarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase h1.h\na b : \u2124\nh\u2080 : \u2200 (x : \u211d), 10 * x ^ 2 - x - 24 = (\u2191a * x - 8) * (\u2191b * x + 3)\nh\u2081 : 10 * 1 ^ 2 - 1 - 24 = (\u2191a * 1 - 8) * (\u2191b * 1 + 3)\nh\u2082 : 10 * 0 ^ 2 - 0 - 24 = (\u2191a * 0 - 8) * (\u2191b * 0 + 3)\nh\u2083 : 10 * (-1) ^ 2 - -1 - 24 = (\u2191a * -1 - 8) * (\u2191b * -1 + 3)\nh\u2084 : 10 * (-2) ^ 2 - -2 - 24 = (\u2191a * -2 - 8) * (\u2191b * -2 + 3)\nh\u2085 : 10 * 2 ^ 2 - 2 - 24 = (\u2191a * 2 - 8) * (\u2191b * 2 + 3)\nh\u2086 : 10 * (-3) ^ 2 - -3 - 24 = (\u2191a * -3 - 8) * (\u2191b * -3 + 3)\nh\u2087 : 10 * 3 ^ 2 - 3 - 24 = (\u2191a * 3 - 8) * (\u2191b * 3 + 3)\nh\u2088 : 10 * (-4) ^ 2 - -4 - 24 = (\u2191a * -4 - 8) * (\u2191b * -4 + 3)\nh\u2089 : 10 * 4 ^ 2 - 4 - 24 = (\u2191a * 4 - 8) * (\u2191b * 4 + 3)\nh\u2081\u2080 : 10 * (-5) ^ 2 - -5 - 24 = (\u2191a * -5 - 8) * (\u2191b * -5 + 3)\nh\u2081\u2081 : 10 * 5 ^ 2 - 5 - 24 = (\u2191a * 5 - 8) * (\u2191b * 5 + 3)\nh\u2081\u2082 : 10 * (-6) ^ 2 - -6 - 24 = (\u2191a * -6 - 8) * (\u2191b * -6 + 3)\nh\u2081\u2083 : 10 * 6 ^ 2 - 6 - 24 = (\u2191a * 6 - 8) * (\u2191b * 6 + 3)\nh\u2081\u2084 : 10 * (-7) ^ 2 - -7 - 24 = (\u2191a * -7 - 8) * (\u2191b * -7 + 3)\nh\u2081\u2085 : 10 * 7 ^ 2 - 7 - 24 = (\u2191a * 7 - 8) * (\u2191b * 7 + 3)\nh\u2081\u2086 : 10 * (-8) ^ 2 - -8 - 24 = (\u2191a * -8 - 8) * (\u2191b * -8 + 3)\nh\u2081\u2087 : 10 * 8 ^ 2 - 8 - 24 = (\u2191a * 8 - 8) * (\u2191b * 8 + 3)\nh\u2081\u2088 : 10 * (-9) ^ 2 - -9 - 24 = (\u2191a * -9 - 8) * (\u2191b * -9 + 3)\nh\u2081\u2089 : 10 * 9 ^ 2 - 9 - 24 = (\u2191a * 9 - 8) * (\u2191b * 9 + 3)\nh\u2082\u2080 : 10 * (-10) ^ 2 - -10 - 24 = (\u2191a * -10 - 8) * (\u2191b * -10 + 3)\nh\u2082\u2081 : 10 * 10 ^ 2 - 10 - 24 = (\u2191a * 10 - 8) * (\u2191b * 10 + 3)\na\u271d : a * b + b < 12\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking for the value of the product of two sums involving logarithms. The expression is:\n\n(Sum from k=1 to 20 of log_{5^k} 3^{k\u00b2}) multiplied by (Sum from k=1 to 100 of log_{9^k} 25^k)\n\nAnd we need to show that the answer is 21,000. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I remember that logarithms with different bases can be converted using the change of base formula. Also, properties of logarithms like log_a b^c = c log_a b might be useful here. Let's start with the first sum.\n\nLooking at the first sum: sum_{k=1}^{20} log_{5^k} 3^{k\u00b2}\n\nLet me rewrite each term in the sum. The general term is log_{5^k} 3^{k\u00b2}. Using the change of base formula, log_b a = (ln a)/(ln b), but maybe there's a simpler way here. Alternatively, since both the base and the argument are exponents, perhaps we can simplify them first.\n\nLet's recall that log_{a^m} b^n = (n/m) log_a b. Is that correct? Let me verify. Yes, because log_{a^m} b^n = (ln b^n)/(ln a^m) = (n ln b)/(m ln a) = (n/m) log_a b. So that's a useful identity.\n\nApplying this to the term log_{5^k} 3^{k\u00b2}, we get:\n\n= (k\u00b2 / k) * log_5 3\n= k * log_5 3\n\nBecause k\u00b2 divided by k is just k. So each term in the first sum simplifies to k * log_5 3. Therefore, the first sum becomes:\n\nsum_{k=1}^{20} k * log_5 3\n\nSince log_5 3 is a constant with respect to k, we can factor it out:\n\nlog_5 3 * sum_{k=1}^{20} k\n\nThe sum of the first n positive integers is n(n+1)/2. So here, sum_{k=1}^{20} k = 20*21/2 = 210. Therefore, the first sum is 210 * log_5 3.\n\nNow, moving on to the second sum: sum_{k=1}^{100} log_{9^k} 25^k\n\nAgain, let's simplify each term. The general term is log_{9^k} 25^k. Let's apply the same identity as before. log_{a^m} b^n = (n/m) log_a b.\n\nBut first, let's express 9 and 25 in terms of their prime bases. 9 is 3\u00b2 and 25 is 5\u00b2. So:\n\nlog_{9^k} 25^k = log_{(3\u00b2)^k} (5\u00b2)^k = log_{3^{2k}} 5^{2k}\n\nApplying the identity:\n\n= (2k / 2k) * log_3 5\n= 1 * log_3 5\n= log_3 5\n\nWait, that's interesting. Because both the base and the argument are raised to the same exponent k, but when expressed in terms of their prime bases, the exponents inside the log cancel out. Let me check that again.\n\nOriginal term: log_{9^k} 25^k\n\nExpress 9 as 3\u00b2 and 25 as 5\u00b2:\n\n= log_{(3\u00b2)^k} (5\u00b2)^k\n= log_{3^{2k}} 5^{2k}\n\nNow, using log_{a^m} b^n = (n/m) log_a b:\n\nHere, a = 3, m = 2k, b = 5, n = 2k.\n\nSo:\n\n= (2k / 2k) * log_3 5\n= 1 * log_3 5\n= log_3 5\n\nSo each term in the second sum is log_3 5. Therefore, the second sum is sum_{k=1}^{100} log_3 5. Since log_3 5 is a constant, this is 100 * log_3 5.\n\nNow, putting it all together, the original expression is:\n\n(210 * log_5 3) * (100 * log_3 5)\n\nMultiply these two products together. Let's rearrange the terms:\n\n210 * 100 * log_5 3 * log_3 5\n\nNote that log_5 3 and log_3 5 are reciprocals of each other. Because log_b a = 1 / log_a b. So log_5 3 = 1 / log_3 5. Therefore, their product is 1.\n\nSo:\n\n210 * 100 * 1 = 210 * 100 = 21,000\n\nHence, the value of the expression is 21,000, which corresponds to option E.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nLet's break down the problem into two parts: the first sum and the second sum. We'll simplify each sum separately and then multiply the results.\n\n**First Sum: \\(\\sum_{k=1}^{20} \\log_{5^k} 3^{k^2}\\)**  \n1. **Simplify the logarithmic terms**:  \n   Use the property \\(\\log_{a^m} b^n = \\frac{n}{m} \\log_a b\\).  \n   For each term \\(\\log_{5^k} 3^{k^2}\\):  \n   \\[\n   \\log_{5^k} 3^{k^2} = \\frac{k^2}{k} \\log_5 3 = k \\log_5 3.\n   \\]\n2. **Sum the simplified terms**:  \n   The sum becomes \\(\\sum_{k=1}^{20} k \\log_5 3\\).  \n   Factor out the constant \\(\\log_5 3\\):  \n   \\[\n   \\log_5 3 \\cdot \\sum_{k=1}^{20} k.\n   \\]\n   The sum \\(\\sum_{k=1}^{20} k\\) is the sum of the first 20 natural numbers:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{20 \\cdot 21}{2} = 210.\n   \\]\n   Thus, the first sum simplifies to \\(210 \\log_5 3\\).\n\n**Second Sum: \\(\\sum_{k=1}^{100} \\log_{9^k} 25^k}\\)**  \n1. **Rewrite bases and arguments**:  \n   Recognize that \\(9 = 3^2\\) and \\(25 = 5^2\\). Substitute:  \n   \\[\n   \\log_{9^k} 25^k = \\log_{(3^2)^k} (5^2)^k = \\log_{3^{2k}} 5^{2k}.\n   \\]\n2. **Simplify the logarithmic terms**:  \n   Apply the same property \\(\\log_{a^m} b^n = \\frac{n}{m} \\log_a b\\):  \n   \\[\n   \\log_{3^{2k}} 5^{2k} = \\frac{2k}{2k} \\log_3 5 = \\log_3 5.\n   \\]\n3. **Sum the simplified terms**:  \n   The sum becomes \\(\\sum_{k=1}^{100} \\log_3 5\\).  \n   Since \\(\\log_3 5\\) is constant, this equals \\(100 \\log_3 5\\).\n\n**Combine the Results**  \nMultiply the two sums:  \n\\[\n(210 \\log_5 3) \\cdot (100 \\log_3 5) = 210 \\cdot 100 \\cdot (\\log_5 3 \\cdot \\log_3 5).\n\\]  \n**Key Insight**: \\(\\log_5 3\\) and \\(\\log_3 5\\) are reciprocals:  \n\\[\n\\log_5 3 = \\frac{1}{\\log_3 5} \\implies \\log_5 3 \\cdot \\log_3 5 = 1.\n\\]  \nThus, the product simplifies to:  \n\\[\n210 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 1 = 21{,}000.\n\\]  \nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{21{,}000}\\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: unsolved goals\nh1 : \u2211 k \u2208 Finset.Icc 1 20, (5 ^ k).logb (3 ^ k ^ 2) = 210 * logb 5 3\nh2 : \u2211 k \u2208 Finset.Icc 1 100, (9 ^ k).logb (25 ^ k) = 100 * logb 3 5\n\u22a2 logb 5 3 * logb 3 5 = 1\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: \nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: The rfl tactic failed.

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to show that the sum from k=2 to 10,000 of 1 over the square root of k is less than 198. Hmm. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that sums involving 1/sqrt(k) can be compared to integrals. Maybe I can use an integral test or integral approximation here. Since the function 1/sqrt(x) is decreasing, the sum from k=2 to N can be bounded by integrals. Let me recall that for a decreasing function f, the sum from k=m to n of f(k) is less than the integral from m-1 to n of f(x) dx. Wait, or is it the other way around? Let me check. For a decreasing function, the integral from a to b gives a lower bound if we use left endpoints and an upper bound if we use right endpoints. So maybe the sum from k=2 to 10000 of 1/sqrt(k) is less than the integral from 1 to 10000 of 1/sqrt(x) dx. Because each term 1/sqrt(k) is less than the area under the curve from k-1 to k. Wait, let me visualize this. If I have the function f(x) = 1/sqrt(x), which is decreasing, then the area under the curve from k-1 to k is greater than f(k), since the function is decreasing. So the sum from k=2 to N of f(k) would be less than the integral from 1 to N of f(x) dx. So that's the approach. Then compute the integral of 1/sqrt(x) from 1 to 10000. The integral of 1/sqrt(x) is 2*sqrt(x). So evaluating from 1 to 10000 gives 2*(sqrt(10000) - sqrt(1)) = 2*(100 - 1) = 198. But wait, the sum from k=2 to 10000 is less than the integral from 1 to 10000. So that would mean the sum is less than 198. But wait, the integral from 1 to 10000 is exactly 198. But the sum from k=2 to 10000 is less than this integral. Therefore, the sum is less than 198. But wait, let me confirm. Let's think about the integral from 1 to 10000. The sum from k=2 to 10000 of 1/sqrt(k) is less than the integral from 1 to 10000 of 1/sqrt(x) dx. Because each term 1/sqrt(k) is less than the integral from k-1 to k of 1/sqrt(x) dx. For example, 1/sqrt(2) is less than the integral from 1 to 2 of 1/sqrt(x) dx, which is 2*(sqrt(2) - sqrt(1)) \u2248 2*(1.4142 - 1) \u2248 0.8284, and 1/sqrt(2) \u2248 0.7071, which is indeed less. So adding all these up from k=2 to 10000, the sum is less than the integral from 1 to 10000. Therefore, the integral is 2*(sqrt(10000) - sqrt(1)) = 2*(100 -1) = 198. Therefore, the sum is less than 198. That seems to work. But wait, the original problem says to sum from k=2 to 10000. So the sum is from 2 to 10000, which is 9999 terms. But the integral from 1 to 10000 would correspond to the sum from k=1 to 9999 of the integral from k to k+1. Wait, maybe I need to adjust the bounds. Let me think again. If I have the sum from k=2 to N, then the integral from 1 to N of 1/sqrt(x) dx would be an upper bound. Because each term 1/sqrt(k) is less than the integral from k-1 to k of 1/sqrt(x) dx. So summing from k=2 to N, the total sum is less than the integral from 1 to N. So yes, the integral gives 2*sqrt(N) - 2*sqrt(1). For N=10000, that's 2*100 - 2*1 = 198. Therefore, the sum from k=2 to 10000 of 1/sqrt(k) is less than 198. That's exactly what we needed to show. But wait, let me check if there's a mistake here. For example, the integral from 1 to 10000 is 198, and the sum from k=2 to 10000 is less than that. So the inequality holds. Therefore, the proof is straightforward by comparing the sum to the integral. But maybe I should also consider the starting index. The sum starts at k=2, so the integral from 1 to 10000 is the upper bound. If the sum started at k=1, then the integral from 1 to 10000 would be less than the sum from k=1 to 9999, but here we start at k=2. Wait, no. Let me think again. The sum from k=2 to 10000 is equal to the sum from k=1 to 10000 minus 1/sqrt(1). So sum_{k=2}^{10000} 1/sqrt(k) = sum_{k=1}^{10000} 1/sqrt(k) - 1. If we can bound sum_{k=1}^{10000} 1/sqrt(k) by the integral from 1 to 10000 + 1/sqrt(1), but maybe that's complicating. Alternatively, using the integral from 1 to 10000 as an upper bound for the sum from k=2 to 10000. Because each term 1/sqrt(k) for k=2 to 10000 is less than the integral from k-1 to k of 1/sqrt(x) dx. So adding all those up gives the sum < integral from 1 to 10000 of 1/sqrt(x) dx = 198. Therefore, the inequality holds. So the key idea is using the integral of a decreasing function to bound the sum from above. That's the standard method for such estimates. Therefore, the proof should be straightforward by comparing the sum to the integral.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo show that the sum \\(\\sum_{k=2}^{10000} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k}} < 198\\), we use the fact that for a decreasing function \\(f(x)\\), the sum \\(\\sum_{k=m}^n f(k)\\) is bounded above by the integral \\(\\int_{m-1}^n f(x) \\, dx\\). Here, \\(f(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x}}\\) is decreasing for \\(x > 0\\).\n\nConsider the integral of \\(f(x)\\) from \\(x = 1\\) to \\(x = 10000\\):\n\\[\n\\int_{1}^{10000} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x}} \\, dx = 2\\sqrt{x} \\,\\Big|_{1}^{10000} = 2(100 - 1) = 198.\n\\]\nSince \\(f(x)\\) is decreasing, each term \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k}}\\) in the sum \\(\\sum_{k=2}^{10000} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k}}\\) is less than the area under \\(f(x)\\) over the interval \\([k-1, k]\\).

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, Euler's polynomial is p(n) = n\u00b2 - n + 41, and it's known for producing primes for small n. The question is asking for the smallest positive integer n where p(n) and p(n+1) share a common factor greater than 1. And we need to show that this smallest n is 41.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for two consecutive terms p(n) and p(n+1) to have a common factor. If they share a common divisor d > 1, then d must divide their difference. Let me write that down. Let's compute p(n+1) - p(n):\n\np(n+1) = (n+1)\u00b2 - (n+1) + 41 = n\u00b2 + 2n + 1 - n - 1 + 41 = n\u00b2 + n + 41.\n\nSo the difference p(n+1) - p(n) = (n\u00b2 + n + 41) - (n\u00b2 - n + 41) = 2n.\n\nTherefore, any common divisor d of p(n) and p(n+1) must divide 2n. Since d divides both p(n) and 2n, d must also divide p(n) and 2n. But p(n) is supposed to be prime for small n, right? Wait, but when n increases, maybe p(n) becomes composite. The problem states that the first time they share a common factor is at n=41.\n\nSo, if d divides both p(n) and p(n+1), then d divides 2n. Let's suppose that d is a prime divisor. Then d divides 2n, so d is either 2 or a prime divisor of n. Let's check for d=2 first. If 2 divides p(n), then p(n) must be even. Let's see p(n) = n\u00b2 - n +41. For n even: n is even, so n\u00b2 is even, n is even, so n\u00b2 -n is even, plus 41 (odd) gives even + odd = odd. So p(n) is odd when n is even. If n is odd: n\u00b2 is odd, n is odd, so n\u00b2 -n is even, plus 41 (odd) gives even + odd = odd. So p(n) is always odd. Therefore, 2 cannot divide p(n), so d cannot be 2. Therefore, any common divisor must be an odd prime that divides n. So d divides n and d divides p(n).\n\nSo, if d divides n and d divides p(n) = n\u00b2 -n +41, then d divides (n\u00b2 -n +41) - n(n) + something. Wait, let's think algebraically. If d divides n, then n \u2261 0 mod d. Substitute into p(n): p(n) \u2261 0\u00b2 - 0 +41 \u226141 mod d. So d divides 41. Therefore, the only possible common divisors are 41 and 1. Since we need a common factor greater than 1, the only possibility is 41. Therefore, 41 must divide both p(n) and p(n+1), which implies that 41 divides n. So the smallest positive integer n where this happens is n=41. But wait, let's check that.\n\nWait, if n=41, then p(41) = 41\u00b2 -41 +41 =41\u00b2. So p(41)=41\u00b2, which is divisible by 41. Then p(42)=42\u00b2 -42 +41. Let's compute that: 42\u00b2=1764, 1764 -42=1722, 1722 +41=1763. Now, check if 1763 is divisible by 41. Let's divide 1763 by 41. 41*43=1763, right? Because 40*43=1720, plus 1*43=43, total 1763. So 1763=41*43. Therefore, p(42)=41*43, which is divisible by 41. So indeed, when n=41, both p(41) and p(42) are divisible by 41. Therefore, their gcd is at least 41, which is greater than 1. So n=41 works.\n\nBut we need to check if there's a smaller n where this happens. Suppose there exists some n <41 where 41 divides p(n). Then p(n) \u22610 mod41. So n\u00b2 -n +41 \u22610 mod41. But 41 \u22610 mod41, so the equation becomes n\u00b2 -n \u22610 mod41. Factor that: n(n-1) \u22610 mod41. Since 41 is prime, this implies that either n\u22610 mod41 or n\u22611 mod41. But since n <41, the only possibilities are n=0 or n=1. But n is a positive integer, so n=1. Let's check p(1)=1 -1 +41=41, which is prime. Then p(2)=4 -2 +41=43, also prime. So p(1)=41 and p(2)=43, which are both primes and do not share a common factor greater than 1. Therefore, the only n less than 41 where 41 divides p(n) is n=0 (which isn't positive) and n=1, but p(1) and p(2) don't share 41 as a common factor. Therefore, the next possible n where 41 divides p(n) is n=41 itself. Hence, the smallest positive integer n is 41.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo find the smallest positive integer \\( n \\) where \\( p(n) = n^2 - n + 41 \\) and \\( p(n+1) \\) share a common factor greater than 1, we analyze their greatest common divisor (gcd). \n\nFirst, observe that if a prime \\( d > 1 \\) divides both \\( p(n) \\) and \\( p(n+1) \\), then \\( d \\) must divide their difference:\n\\[\np(n+1) - p(n) = \\left[(n+1)^2 - (n+1) + 41\\right] - \\left[n^2 - n + 41\\right] = 2n.\n\\]\nThus, \\( d \\) divides \\( 2n \\). Since \\( p(n) \\) is always odd (as shown by parity checks for even/odd \\( n \\)), \\( d \\) cannot be 2. Therefore, \\( d \\) must be an odd prime divisor of \\( n \\). \n\nIf \\( d \\) divides \\( n \\), substituting \\( n \\equiv 0 \\mod d \\) into \\( p(n) \\) gives:\n\\[\np(n) \\equiv 0^2 - 0 + 41 \\equiv 41 \\mod d.\n\\]\nFor \\( d \\) to divide \\( p(n) \\), \\( d \\) must divide 41. Since 41 is prime, the only possible common divisor is 41 itself. Hence, \\( 41 \\) must divide both \\( p(n) \\) and \\( p(n+1) \\), which implies \\( 41 \\mid n \\). The smallest positive \\( n \\) satisfying this is \\( n = 41 \\).\n\nTo confirm:\n- \\( p(41) = 41^2 - 41 + 41 = 41^2 \\), divisible by 41.\n- \\( p(42) = 42^2 - 42 + 41 = 1763 = 41 \\times 43 \\), also divisible by 41.\n\nFor \\( n < 41 \\), solving \\( n^2 - n + 41 \\equiv 0 \\mod 41 \\) reduces to \\( n(n-1) \\equiv 0 \\mod 41 \\). The solutions \\( n \\equiv 0 \\mod 41 \\) or \\( n \\equiv 1 \\mod 41 \\) correspond to \\( n = 0 \\) (not positive) or \\( n = 1 \\). However, \\( p(1) = 41 \\) and \\( p(2) = 43 \\) are coprime primes. Thus, \\( n = 41 \\) is indeed the smallest such positive integer.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking how many 4-digit numbers, which only have even digits, are divisible by 5. The options are given, and we need to show the answer is 100. \n\nFirst, let's recall the theorem from the context. It says that a number is divisible by 5 if and only if its units digit (the last digit) is 0 or 5. But wait, in this problem, all digits must be even. The even digits are 0, 2, 4, 6, 8. So the units digit has to be even and divisible by 5. But the only even digits that are divisible by 5 are 0. Because 5 is not even, so the units digit can't be 5. Therefore, the units digit must be 0. That's a crucial point. So the last digit is fixed as 0.\n\nNow, the number is a 4-digit number between 1000 and 9999. The first digit (thousands place) can't be 0, so it has to be 2, 4, 6, or 8. The other two middle digits (hundreds and tens places) can be any even digits, including 0. \n\nLet's break down each digit position:\n\n1. Thousands place (first digit): Must be even and non-zero. Possible choices: 2, 4, 6, 8. That's 4 options.\n2. Hundreds place (second digit): Any even digit. Possible choices: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8. That's 5 options.\n3. Tens place (third digit): Similarly, any even digit. 5 options.\n4. Units place (fourth digit): Must be 0 to satisfy divisibility by 5. Only 1 option.\n\nTo find the total number of such numbers, we multiply the number of choices for each digit. So:\n\n4 (thousands) \u00d7 5 (hundreds) \u00d7 5 (tens) \u00d7 1 (units) = 4 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 1 = 100.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Let me double-check if there's any oversight. The key points are:\n\n- The units digit must be 0 (since it's the only even digit divisible by 5).\n- The first digit can't be 0, so 4 choices.\n- Middle digits can be any even digits, so 5 each.\n\nMultiplying them gives 4\u00d75\u00d75\u00d71 = 100. That matches option B. \n\nI think that's correct. The theorem directly tells us the units digit must be 0, and the rest is counting the possible even digits for each position. No other constraints are mentioned, so this should be the answer.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo determine how many 4-digit numbers with only even digits are divisible by 5, we start by recalling the divisibility rule for 5: a number is divisible by 5 if and only if its units digit is 0 or 5. However, since the problem restricts all digits to be even, the units digit must be 0 (as 5 is not even). This fixes the last digit to 0.\n\nNext, we analyze the remaining three digits (thousands, hundreds, and tens places):\n\n1. **Thousands place (first digit):**  \n   It cannot be 0 (to ensure the number is 4-digit). The allowed even digits are 2, 4, 6, 8.  \n   **Choices:** 4.\n\n2. **Hundreds place (second digit):**  \n   Any even digit is allowed: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8.  \n   **Choices:** 5.\n\n3. **Tens place (third digit):**  \n   Similarly, any even digit: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8.  \n   **Choices:** 5.\n\n4. **Units place (fourth digit):**  \n   Fixed at 0 (as established earlier).  \n   **Choices:** 1.\n\nMultiplying the number of choices for each digit gives:  \n\\[\n4 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 1 = 100.\n\\]\n\nThus, there are **100** valid 4-digit numbers with only even digits that are divisible by 5. This confirms the answer is **(B) 100**.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. We need to show that for all integers n \u2265 9, the expression (n+2)! - (n+1)! all divided by n! is a perfect square. Hmm, let's start by simplifying the expression.\n\nFirst, factor out common terms in the numerator. Both terms have factorials, so maybe we can factor out (n+1)! from both. Let's see:\n\n(n+2)! is equal to (n+2)(n+1)! because factorial increases by multiplying the next integer. So, (n+2)! = (n+2)(n+1)!.\n\nThen the numerator becomes (n+2)(n+1)! - (n+1)! which is (n+1)! multiplied by (n+2 - 1), right? Because factoring out (n+1)! gives us (n+1)! [ (n+2) - 1 ].\n\nSimplifying inside the brackets: n+2 -1 = n+1. So the numerator is (n+1)! * (n+1). Then we divide by n!.\n\nSo the entire expression is [(n+1)! * (n+1)] / n!.\n\nBut (n+1)! is (n+1)*n!, so substituting that in, we have [(n+1)*n! * (n+1)] / n!.\n\nThe n! in the numerator and denominator cancels out, leaving (n+1)*(n+1) which is (n+1)^2. Oh, that's a perfect square! So the expression simplifies to (n+1) squared, which is obviously a perfect square for any integer n. Therefore, the answer must be D, a perfect square.\n\nWait, but let me check for n=9 to make sure. Plugging in n=9: (11! -10!)/9! = (39916800 - 3628800)/362880 = (36288000)/362880 = 100. Which is 10^2, and since n=9, (9+1)^2=100. That works. Another check with n=10: (12! -11!)/10! = (479001600 - 39916800)/3628800 = (439084800)/3628800 = 121. Which is 11^2, and (10+1)^2=121. Yep, that's correct. So the simplification seems valid, and the result is indeed a perfect square for all n \u22659. The other options can be ruled out because, for example, 100 is a multiple of 4 and 10, but when n=9, the answer is 100 which is a multiple of both, but when n=10, the result is 121, which is not a multiple of 4 or 10. So the only consistent answer is D.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nLet's start by simplifying the given expression step by step. The expression is \\(\\frac{(n+2)! - (n+1)!}{n!}\\). \n\nFirst, observe that \\((n+2)!\\) can be rewritten as \\((n+2)(n+1)!\\). This is because the factorial \\((n+2)!\\) means multiplying all integers from \\(1\\) to \\(n+2\\), which is equivalent to \\((n+2) \\times (n+1)!\\). Substituting this into the numerator, we get:\n\\[\n(n+2)(n+1)! - (n+1)!.\n\\]\n\nNext, factor out the common term \\((n+1)!\\) from both parts of the numerator:\n\\[\n(n+1)! \\cdot \\left[(n+2) - 1\\right] = (n+1)! \\cdot (n+1).\n\\]\n\nNow, divide this result by \\(n!\\):\n\\[\n\\frac{(n+1)! \\cdot (n+1)}{n!}.\n\\]\n\nSince \\((n+1)! = (n+1) \\cdot n!\\), substitute this into the expression:\n\\[\n\\frac{(n+1) \\cdot n! \\cdot (n+1)}{n!}.\n\\]\n\nThe \\(n!\\) terms cancel out, leaving:\n\\[\n(n+1) \\cdot (n+1) = (n+1)^2.\n\\]\n\nThis final result, \\((n+1)^2\\), is clearly a perfect square for any integer \\(n\\). For example:\n- If \\(n = 9\\), the expression evaluates to \\(10^2 = 100\\).\n- If \\(n = 10\\), it becomes \\(11^2 = 121\\).\n\nThus, for all integers \\(n \\geq 9\\), the expression simplifies to a perfect square. This rules out the other options (e.g., \\(121\\) is not a multiple of \\(4\\) or \\(10\\), and it is not a prime or a cube). Therefore, the correct answer is **(D) a perfect square**.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. We need to find the smallest positive integer k such that for every positive integer n, 6n + k is relatively prime to each of 6n+1, 6n+2, and 6n+3. The answer is supposed to be 5, but let's figure out why.\n\nFirst, let's understand what \"relatively prime\" means. Two numbers are relatively prime if their greatest common divisor (gcd) is 1. So, for each n, 6n + k must share no common factors with 6n+1, 6n+2, and 6n+3 except 1.\n\nLet's denote the numbers as follows:\n- A = 6n + k\n- B = 6n + 1\n- C = 6n + 2\n- D = 6n + 3\n\nWe need gcd(A, B) = 1, gcd(A, C) = 1, and gcd(A, D) = 1 for all n \u2265 1.\n\nLet's start by checking possible values of k starting from 1 upwards, since we need the smallest k.\n\nCase k=1:\nA = 6n + 1\nBut then A is equal to B (6n+1), so gcd(A,B) = A, which is at least 7 when n=1. So k=1 is invalid.\n\nCase k=2:\nA = 6n + 2\nCheck gcd(6n+2, 6n+1). The difference is 1, so gcd(6n+2,6n+1)=1. Similarly, gcd(6n+2,6n+2)=6n+2, but wait, 6n+2 is C, which is 6n+2. Wait, no, the problem states \"each of 6n+3, 6n+2, and 6n+1\". Wait, the original problem says \"6n+k is relatively prime to each of 6n+3, 6n+2, and 6n+1\". Wait, so when k=2, A=6n+2, which is the same as C=6n+2. So gcd(A,C)=6n+2, which is not 1. So k=2 is invalid.\n\nSimilarly, k=3:\nA=6n+3. Then D=6n+3, so gcd(A,D)=A, which is 6n+3, which is at least 9 when n=1. Not 1. So invalid.\n\nk=4:\nA=6n+4. Let's check gcd with B=6n+1. The difference between A and B is 3. So gcd(A,B) divides 3. If 3 divides both, then 3 divides B=6n+1. But 6n is divisible by 3, so 6n+1 \u22611 mod 3. So 3 doesn't divide B. Hence gcd(A,B)=1. Similarly, check with C=6n+2. A=6n+4 and C=6n+2. The difference is 2. So gcd(A,C) divides 2. If both are even, then gcd is at least 2. Let's see: A=6n+4=2(3n+2), which is even. C=6n+2=2(3n+1), also even. So gcd(A,C)=2, which is not 1. Hence k=4 is invalid.\n\nk=5:\nA=6n+5. Let's check with B=6n+1. The difference is 4. So gcd(A,B) divides 4. Let's compute gcd(6n+5,6n+1). Let's subtract: (6n+5)-(6n+1)=4. So gcd(6n+5,6n+1)=gcd(6n+1,4). Now, 6n+1 is odd because 6n is even, so 6n+1 is odd. Hence gcd(6n+1,4)=1. So gcd(A,B)=1.\n\nNext, check with C=6n+2. The difference between A and C is 3. So gcd(A,C) divides 3. Let's compute gcd(6n+5,6n+2). Subtract: (6n+5)-(6n+2)=3. So gcd(6n+5,6n+2)=gcd(6n+2,3). 6n is divisible by 3, so 6n+2 \u22612 mod 3. Hence 3 doesn't divide 6n+2, so gcd is 1.\n\nNow check with D=6n+3. The difference between A and D is 2. So gcd(A,D) divides 2. A=6n+5 is odd (6n is even, +5 makes it odd). D=6n+3 is also odd (even +3=odd). So both are odd, so gcd can't be 2. Hence gcd(A,D) must divide 1, so it's 1.\n\nThus, for k=5, all gcds are 1. Now we need to check if k=5 is indeed the smallest. We saw that k=1,2,3,4 don't work. So 5 is the minimal.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo find the smallest positive integer \\( k \\) such that \\( 6n + k \\) is coprime to \\( 6n+1 \\), \\( 6n+2 \\), and \\( 6n+3 \\) for all positive integers \\( n \\), we analyze the greatest common divisors (gcd) between \\( 6n + k \\) and each of these terms. The key idea is to ensure that \\( 6n + k \\) shares no common factors greater than 1 with any of the three expressions, regardless of \\( n \\).\n\n**Step 1: Test \\( k = 1, 2, 3, 4 \\)**  \n- For \\( k = 1 \\): \\( 6n + 1 \\) equals \\( 6n + 1 \\), so it trivially shares all factors with itself, violating coprimality.  \n- For \\( k = 2 \\): \\( 6n + 2 \\) equals \\( 6n + 2 \\), so it shares a gcd of \\( 6n + 2 \\) (which is even and greater than 1).  \n- For \\( k = 3 \\): \\( 6n + 3 \\) equals \\( 6n + 3 \\), which is divisible by 3, violating coprimality.  \n- For \\( k = 4 \\): \\( 6n + 4 \\) and \\( 6n + 2 \\) are both even, so their gcd is at least 2.  \n\nThus, \\( k = 1, 2, 3, 4 \\) fail.\n\n**Step 2: Test \\( k = 5 \\)**  \nWe verify coprimality for \\( 6n + 5 \\):  \n1. **With \\( 6n + 1 \\):**  \n   The difference is \\( (6n + 5) - (6n + 1) = 4 \\). Since \\( 6n + 1 \\) is odd, \\( \\gcd(6n + 5, 6n + 1) = \\gcd(6n + 1, 4) = 1 \\).  \n\n2. **With \\( 6n + 2 \\):**  \n   The difference is \\( (6n + 5) - (6n + 2) = 3 \\). Since \\( 6n + 2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3} \\), \\( \\gcd(6n + 5, 6n + 2) = \\gcd(6n + 2, 3) = 1 \\).  \n\n3. **With \\( 6n + 3 \\):**  \n   The difference is \\( (6n + 5) - (6n + 3) = 2 \\). Both terms are odd, so \\( \\gcd(6n + 5, 6n + 3) \\) divides 1.  \n\nAll gcds equal 1, confirming \\( k = 5 \\) works. Since smaller \\( k \\) values fail, \\( k = 5 \\) is indeed the smallest solution.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown constant 'Nat.gcd_add'\nunsolved goals\nk : \u2115\nh\u2080 : 0 < k\nh\u2081 : \u2200 (n : \u2115), (6 * n + k).gcd (6 * n + 3) = 1\nh\u2082 : \u2200 (n : \u2115), (6 * n + k).gcd (6 * n + 2) = 1\nh\u2083 : \u2200 (n : \u2115), (6 * n + k).gcd (6 * n + 1) = 1\nn : \u2115\n\u22a2 (6 * n + 3).gcd (6 * n + 5) = 1\nunknown constant 'Nat.gcd_add'\nunsolved goals\nk : \u2115\nh\u2080 : 0 < k\nh\u2081 : \u2200 (n : \u2115), (6 * n + k).gcd (6 * n + 3) = 1\nh\u2082 : \u2200 (n : \u2115), (6 * n + k).gcd (6 * n + 2) = 1\nh\u2083 : \u2200 (n : \u2115), (6 * n + k).gcd (6 * n + 1) = 1\nh\u2084 : \u2200 (n : \u2115), (6 * n + 5).gcd (6 * n + 3) = 1\nn : \u2115\n\u22a2 (6 * n + 2).gcd (6 * n + 5) = 1\nunknown constant 'Nat.gcd_add'\nunsolved goals\nk : \u2115\nh\u2080 : 0 < k\nh\u2081 : \u2200 (n : \u2115), (6 * n + k).gcd (6 * n + 3) = 1\nh\u2082 : \u2200 (n : \u2115), (6 * n + k).gcd (6 * n + 2) = 1\nh\u2083 : \u2200 (n : \u2115), (6 * n + k).gcd (6 * n + 1) = 1\nh\u2084 : \u2200 (n : \u2115), (6 * n + 5).gcd (6 * n + 3) = 1\nh\u2085 : \u2200 (n : \u2115), (6 * n + 5).gcd (6 * n + 2) = 1\nn : \u2115\n\u22a2 (6 * n + 1).gcd (6 * n + 5) = 1\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase a\nk : \u2115\nh\u2080 : 0 < k\nh\u2081 : \u2200 (n : \u2115), (6 * n + k).gcd (6 * n + 3) = 1\nh\u2082 : \u2200 (n : \u2115), (6 * n + k).gcd (6 * n + 2) = 1\nh\u2083 : \u2200 (n : \u2115), (6 * n + k).gcd (6 * n + 1) = 1\nh\u2084 : \u2200 (n : \u2115), (6 * n + 5).gcd (6 * n + 3) = 1\nh\u2085 : \u2200 (n : \u2115), (6 * n + 5).gcd (6 * n + 2) = 1\nh\u2086 : \u2200 (n : \u2115), (6 * n + 5).gcd (6 * n + 1) = 1\na\u271d : 5 > k\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'apply' failed, failed to unify\n  (6 * ?n + k).gcd (6 * ?n + 3) = 1\nwith\n  (6 * n + 3).gcd (6 * n + 5) = 1\nk : \u2115\nh\u2080 : 0 < k\nh\u2081 : \u2200 (n : \u2115), (6 * n + k).gcd (6 * n + 3) = 1\nh\u2082 : \u2200 (n : \u2115), (6 * n + k).gcd (6 * n + 2) = 1\nh\u2083 : \u2200 (n : \u2115), (6 * n + k).gcd (6 * n + 1) = 1\nn : \u2115\n\u22a2 (6 * n + 3).gcd (6 * n + 5) = 1\ntactic 'apply' failed, failed to unify\n  (6 * ?n + k).gcd (6 * ?n + 2) = 1\nwith\n  (6 * n + 2).gcd (6 * n + 5) = 1\nk : \u2115\nh\u2080 : 0 < k\nh\u2081 : \u2200 (n : \u2115), (6 * n + k).gcd (6 * n + 3) = 1\nh\u2082 : \u2200 (n : \u2115), (6 * n + k).gcd (6 * n + 2) = 1\nh\u2083 : \u2200 (n : \u2115), (6 * n + k).gcd (6 * n + 1) = 1\nh\u2084 : \u2200 (n : \u2115), (6 * n + 5).gcd (6 * n + 3) = 1\nn : \u2115\n\u22a2 (6 * n + 2).gcd (6 * n + 5) = 1\ntactic 'apply' failed, failed to unify\n  (6 * ?n + k).gcd (6 * ?n + 1) = 1\nwith\n  (6 * n + 1).gcd (6 * n + 5) = 1\nk : \u2115\nh\u2080 : 0 < k\nh\u2081 : \u2200 (n : \u2115), (6 * n + k).gcd (6 * n + 3) = 1\nh\u2082 : \u2200 (n : \u2115), (6 * n + k).gcd (6 * n + 2) = 1\nh\u2083 : \u2200 (n : \u2115), (6 * n + k).gcd (6 * n + 1) = 1\nh\u2084 : \u2200 (n : \u2115), (6 * n + 5).gcd (6 * n + 3) = 1\nh\u2085 : \u2200 (n : \u2115), (6 * n + 5).gcd (6 * n + 2) = 1\nn : \u2115\n\u22a2 (6 * n + 1).gcd (6 * n + 5) = 1\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase a\nk : \u2115\nh\u2080 : 0 < k\nh\u2081 : \u2200 (n : \u2115), (6 * n + k).gcd (6 * n + 3) = 1\nh\u2082 : \u2200 (n : \u2115), (6 * n + k).gcd (6 * n + 2) = 1\nh\u2083 : \u2200 (n : \u2115), (6 * n + k).gcd (6 * n + 1) = 1\nh\u2084 : \u2200 (n : \u2115), (6 * n + 5).gcd (6 * n + 3) = 1\nh\u2085 : \u2200 (n : \u2115), (6 * n + 5).gcd (6 * n + 2) = 1\nh\u2086 : \u2200 (n : \u2115), (6 * n + 5).gcd (6 * n + 1) = 1\na\u271d : 5 > k\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to show that there are two irrational numbers, a and b, such that when you raise a to the power of b, the result is rational. Hmm, let's think about this. I remember that sometimes when you take an irrational number to another irrational power, you might end up with a rational number. But how exactly?\n\nFirst, let me recall some known examples. For instance, sqrt(2) is irrational, right? And we know that sqrt(2)^sqrt(2) is also irrational, but wait, is that always the case? Maybe there's a way to use this. Oh, right! There's a classic example where you consider sqrt(2) raised to sqrt(2) again. Let me think. Suppose we take a = sqrt(2) and b = sqrt(2). Then a^b is sqrt(2)^sqrt(2). But is that rational or irrational? I think it's actually irrational, but I'm not 100% sure. But even if it is irrational, maybe there's a way to use this in a different way.\n\nWait, here's an idea. Let's consider two cases. Case 1: If sqrt(2)^sqrt(2) is rational, then we're done because both a and b are sqrt(2), which are irrational, and their power is rational. But if it's irrational, then maybe we can use that result in another exponent. So in Case 2, if sqrt(2)^sqrt(2) is irrational, let's take a as sqrt(2)^sqrt(2) (which is irrational) and b as sqrt(2) (which is also irrational). Then a^b would be (sqrt(2)^sqrt(2))^sqrt(2). Simplifying that exponent, we get sqrt(2)^(sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)) = sqrt(2)^2 = 2, which is rational. So in either case, we have such a pair (a, b). That seems to work!\n\nBut wait, does this cover all possibilities? Let me check. If the first case is true, then we have our example. If not, the second case gives us another example. So regardless of whether sqrt(2)^sqrt(2) is rational or not, we can find such a and b. That's clever because it uses the law of excluded middle without needing to know the actual value of sqrt(2)^sqrt(2). \n\nAlternatively, another approach could use logarithms. Suppose we take a as 2 and b as log base 2 of 3. Wait, but 2 is rational, so that's not allowed. Hmm. Maybe if we take a as e (which is irrational) and b as ln 3 (also irrational), then e^{ln 3} = 3, which is rational. But wait, e is irrational and ln 3 is irrational, so that works. Wait, but does this example count? Because e is transcendental, but the problem just requires a and b to be irrational, not necessarily algebraic. So yes, this would be another example. But maybe the problem wants both a and b to be irrational, and in this case, they are. So that's another valid proof. But perhaps the first approach is more elementary because it uses sqrt(2) instead of transcendental numbers.\n\nBut the problem is asking for an existence proof, so either method works. The first method is nice because it uses a non-constructive approach, not needing to know the actual values, just using the two cases. The second method is constructive but uses transcendental numbers. Either way, the existence is shown. \n\nSo to summarize, the key idea is to consider a known irrational number like sqrt(2), raise it to another irrational power, and then depending on whether that result is rational or not, use it to construct the required pair. Alternatively, use known transcendental numbers and their logarithms to get a rational result. Both methods demonstrate the existence of such pairs without necessarily providing explicit numbers, especially in the first case where we don't know if sqrt(2)^sqrt(2) is rational or not, but either way, we can find a valid pair.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nLet's tackle this by considering a clever example involving \u221a2, which we know is irrational. The key idea is to create a \"test case\" and then use its outcome to construct our solution.\n\nFirst, look at the number \u221a2 raised to the power of \u221a2:  \n(\u221a2)^(\u221a2).  \nThis result could either be rational or irrational. We don't need to know which it actually is\u2014we just need to analyze both possibilities:\n\n1. **Case 1**: If (\u221a2)^(\u221a2) is **rational**, then we\u2019re done! Let \\( a = \\sqrt{2} \\) and \\( b = \\sqrt{2} \\). Both are irrational, and \\( a^b \\) is rational by assumption.\n\n2. **Case 2**: If (\u221a2)^(\u221a2) is **irrational**, then take \\( a = (\\sqrt{2})^{\\sqrt{2}} \\) (which is irrational in this case) and \\( b = \\sqrt{2} \\) (still irrational). Now compute \\( a^b \\):  \n\\[\n\\left( (\\sqrt{2})^{\\sqrt{2}} \\right)^{\\sqrt{2}} = (\\sqrt{2})^{\\sqrt{2} \\cdot \\sqrt{2}} = (\\sqrt{2})^2 = 2,\n\\]  \nwhich is clearly rational.\n\nIn either case, we\u2019ve found irrational numbers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) such that \\( a^b \\) is rational. This proof works because it doesn\u2019t require knowing the actual nature of \\( (\\sqrt{2})^{\\sqrt{2}} \\); it simply leverages the logical structure of the problem.

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. We have three equations with three variables: x, y, and z. The equations are:\n\n1. 3x + y = 17\n2. 5y + z = 14\n3. 3x + 5z = 41\n\nWe need to find the sum x + y + z and show that it equals 12. Hmm, since we're dealing with three equations and three variables, maybe we can solve for each variable step by step. But the problem mentions showing the sum is 12, so maybe there's a way to find the sum without finding each variable individually? Let me think.\n\nFirst, let's see if adding the equations or manipulating them can lead us directly to the sum. Let's write them down again:\n\nEquation 1: 3x + y = 17  \nEquation 2: 5y + z = 14  \nEquation 3: 3x + 5z = 41  \n\nIf we add all three equations together, what do we get? Let's try that:\n\nLeft side: 3x + y + 5y + z + 3x + 5z  \nCombine like terms: (3x + 3x) + (y + 5y) + (z + 5z) = 6x + 6y + 6z  \nRight side: 17 + 14 + 41 = 72  \n\nSo, 6x + 6y + 6z = 72. If we factor out the 6, we get 6(x + y + z) = 72. Dividing both sides by 6 gives x + y + z = 12. Wait, that's exactly what we needed to show! So by adding all three equations, we directly get the sum. That seems straightforward. But let me check if this is valid.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a catch here. For example, do the equations have a unique solution? If the system is consistent and has at least one solution, then the sum would indeed be 12. But if there are no solutions, then this approach might not hold. However, since the problem asks to show that the sum is 12, it's implied that there is a solution. Let me verify by solving for each variable to ensure consistency.\n\nStarting with Equation 1: 3x + y = 17. Let's solve for y: y = 17 - 3x.\n\nSubstitute y into Equation 2: 5(17 - 3x) + z = 14.  \nCalculate: 85 - 15x + z = 14  \nThen, z = 14 - 85 + 15x = -71 + 15x.\n\nNow, substitute z into Equation 3: 3x + 5(-71 + 15x) = 41  \nCalculate: 3x - 355 + 75x = 41  \nCombine like terms: 78x - 355 = 41  \nAdd 355 to both sides: 78x = 396  \nDivide by 78: x = 396 / 78. Let's simplify that. 396 divided by 78. Both divisible by 6: 396 \u00f76=66, 78\u00f76=13. So x=66/13. Wait, that's 5.0769... That's not an integer. But the original problem didn't specify that x, y, z are integers. Wait, but looking back at the context given, the previous problem involved Diophantine equations (integer solutions). However, this problem doesn't state that variables must be integers. Hmm, but maybe there's a mistake here. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, Equation 3 substitution: 3x + 5z = 41. We found z = -71 +15x. So substituting:\n\n3x +5(-71 +15x) = 41  \n3x -355 +75x =41  \n78x -355 =41  \n78x = 41 +355 = 396  \nx=396/78. Simplify: divide numerator and denominator by 6: 396/6=66, 78/6=13. So x=66/13 \u22485.0769...\n\nThen y=17-3x=17-3*(66/13)=17 - 198/13= (221 -198)/13=23/13\u22481.769...\n\nThen z= -71 +15x= -71 +15*(66/13)= -71 +990/13= (-71*13 +990)/13= (-923 +990)/13=67/13\u22485.1538...\n\nSo x+y+z=66/13 +23/13 +67/13= (66+23+67)/13=156/13=12. Exactly 12. So even though x, y, z are fractions, their sum is indeed 12. Therefore, the initial approach of adding all three equations works because the coefficients of x, y, z in the combined equation lead directly to the sum. So regardless of the individual values, the sum is 12. That's clever! So the answer is 12, and the proof is straightforward by adding the equations.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo find the value of \\( x + y + z \\) given the system of equations:\n\n1. \\( 3x + y = 17 \\)\n2. \\( 5y + z = 14 \\)\n3. \\( 3x + 5z = 41 \\)\n\nwe can add all three equations together. Let's sum the left-hand sides and the right-hand sides:\n\n\\[\n(3x + y) + (5y + z) + (3x + 5z) = 17 + 14 + 41\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the left-hand side:\n- Combine like terms: \\( 3x + 3x = 6x \\), \\( y + 5y = 6y \\), and \\( z + 5z = 6z \\).\n- This gives \\( 6x + 6y + 6z \\).\n\nSimplifying the right-hand side:\n- \\( 17 + 14 + 41 = 72 \\).\n\nThus, the equation becomes:\n\\[\n6x + 6y + 6z = 72\n\\]\n\nFactor out the common term \\( 6 \\):\n\\[\n6(x + y + z) = 72\n\\]\n\nDivide both sides by \\( 6 \\):\n\\[\nx + y + z = 12\n\\]\n\nThis shows that the sum \\( x + y + z \\) must equal \\( 12 \\), regardless of the individual values of \\( x \\), \\( y \\), and \\( z \\). To confirm consistency, solving for each variable individually (as shown in the detailed steps) also leads to \\( x + y + z = 12 \\), verifying the result.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The function f(n) is defined differently depending on whether n is odd or even. For odd n, it's just n squared. For even n, it's n squared minus 4n minus 1. We need to compute f applied five times starting with 4, so f(f(f(f(f(4))))), and show that the result is 1.\n\nFirst, I'll start by computing each application of f one by one. Let's note that each time we apply f, we have to check if the current value is odd or even to decide which case of the function to use.\n\nStarting with the first application: f(4). Since 4 is even, we use the second case. So f(4) = 4\u00b2 - 4*4 - 1. Calculating that: 16 - 16 - 1 = -1. So the result is -1.\n\nNext, compute f(f(4)) which is f(-1). Now, -1 is odd, so we use the first case: (-1)\u00b2 = 1. So f(-1) = 1. Now we have f(f(4)) = 1.\n\nThird application: f(f(f(4))) = f(1). 1 is odd, so again square it: 1\u00b2 = 1. So this result is 1 again.\n\nFourth application: f(f(f(f(4)))) = f(1). Wait, that's the same as before. Since 1 is odd, it's 1 squared, which is 1. So again, 1.\n\nFifth application: f(f(f(f(f(4))))) = f(1) = 1. So after the second application, all subsequent applications of f just keep returning 1. Therefore, the final result is 1.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's go through each step again.\n\nFirst step: f(4). 4 is even. So 4\u00b2 = 16. Then subtract 4*4 which is 16, and subtract 1. So 16 -16 -1 = -1. Correct.\n\nSecond step: f(-1). -1 is odd. Squared is 1. Correct.\n\nThird step: f(1). 1 is odd. Squared is 1. Correct.\n\nFourth step: f(1) again. Same result, 1.\n\nFifth step: f(1) again. Still 1. So yes, after the second application, it's 1, and then applying f three more times doesn't change it. Therefore, the answer is indeed 1.\n\nI think that's all. Each step checks out. The key here is that once we reach 1, which is odd, applying f again just keeps it at 1. So the function stabilizes there.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nLet's compute each application of \\( f \\) step-by-step, starting with \\( f(4) \\), and track whether the current value is odd or even to determine which case of the function to use.\n\n1. **First application: \\( f(4) \\)**  \n   Since \\( 4 \\) is even, use the second case:  \n   \\( f(4) = 4^2 - 4(4) - 1 = 16 - 16 - 1 = -1 \\).\n\n2. **Second application: \\( f(f(4)) = f(-1) \\)**  \n   \\( -1 \\) is odd, so use the first case:  \n   \\( f(-1) = (-1)^2 = 1 \\).\n\n3. **Third application: \\( f(f(f(4))) = f(1) \\)**  \n   \\( 1 \\) is odd, so again use the first case:  \n   \\( f(1) = 1^2 = 1 \\).\n\n4. **Fourth application: \\( f(f(f(f(4)))) = f(1) \\)**  \n   The result remains \\( 1 \\), as \\( f(1) = 1 \\).\n\n5. **Fifth application: \\( f(f(f(f(f(4))))) = f(1) \\)**  \n   Once more, \\( f(1) = 1 \\).\n\nAfter the second application, the value stabilizes at \\( 1 \\).

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to solve the congruence 2n \u2261 15 mod 47 and show that the solution is n \u2261 31 mod 47. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that solving a congruence like ax \u2261 b mod m usually involves finding the multiplicative inverse of a modulo m, provided that a and m are coprime. Since 2 and 47 are both primes (well, 2 is prime and 47 is prime), their greatest common divisor should be 1. Let me check that. GCD(2,47) is 1 because 47 is a prime number and doesn't divide 2. So that means 2 has an inverse modulo 47. Once I find that inverse, I can multiply both sides of the congruence by it to solve for n.\n\nSo the plan is: find the inverse of 2 mod 47, then multiply both sides by that inverse to get n \u2261 15 * inverse_of_2 mod 47. Then compute 15 times the inverse of 2 mod 47 and see if it's 31.\n\nBut how do I find the inverse of 2 mod 47? The inverse of a number a modulo m is a number x such that ax \u2261 1 mod m. So I need to find x where 2x \u2261 1 mod 47. That means 2x - 1 is divisible by 47, or 2x = 1 + 47k for some integer k. Let's solve for x. Let's try to find k such that (1 + 47k) is divisible by 2. Since 47 is odd, 47k will be odd if k is odd, and even if k is even. So 1 + 47k will be even when k is odd. Let's take k=1: 1 + 47*1 = 48. 48 divided by 2 is 24. So x=24. Therefore, the inverse of 2 mod 47 is 24 because 2*24=48 \u2261 1 mod 47. That checks out.\n\nNow, multiply both sides of the original congruence by 24. So 2n \u226115 mod 47 becomes 24*2n \u226124*15 mod47. But 24*2 is 48, which is 1 mod47. So left side is n \u226124*15 mod47. Now compute 24*15. Let's calculate that: 24*10=240, 24*5=120, so 240+120=360. Now 360 divided by 47: 47*7=329, 360-329=31. So 360 \u226131 mod47. Therefore, n \u226131 mod47. So the solution is n=31 mod47. That matches what the problem asked to show.\n\nWait, but let me verify this. Let's plug n=31 back into the original equation. 2*31=62. Now 62 mod47: 47*1=47, 62-47=15. So 62\u226115 mod47. Yes, that works. So 31 is indeed the solution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this. For example, solving 2n \u226115 mod47 can be done by adding multiples of 47 to 15 until I get an even number, then dividing by 2. Let's see. 15 is odd. Adding 47 once gives 15+47=62, which is even. Then 62/2=31. So that's another way to see it. Since 2n must be congruent to 15, which is odd, but 47 is odd, adding 47 (which is odd) to 15 gives an even number, which can then be divided by 2. So that's another method. Either way, the answer is 31.\n\nI think that's solid. Both methods confirm that n=31 is the solution. The first method uses the inverse, the second method manipulates the congruence directly by adding the modulus until a suitable multiple is found. Both lead to the same result. So the proof is complete.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo solve the congruence \\(2n \\equiv 15 \\pmod{47}\\), we need to find an integer \\(n\\) such that when \\(2n\\) is divided by \\(47\\), the remainder is \\(15\\). Here's how we proceed:\n\n1. **Check for invertibility**: Since \\(2\\) and \\(47\\) are coprime (their greatest common divisor is \\(1\\)), \\(2\\) has a multiplicative inverse modulo \\(47\\). This inverse is a number \\(x\\) such that \\(2x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{47}\\).\n\n2. **Find the inverse of \\(2\\) modulo \\(47\\)**:\n   - We solve \\(2x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{47}\\).

Thus, \\(x = 24\\) is the inverse.\n\n3. **Multiply both sides by the inverse**:\n   - Multiply the congruence \\(2n \\equiv 15 \\pmod{47}\\) by \\(24\\):\n     \\[\n     (24 \\times 2)n \\equiv 24 \\times 15 \\pmod{47}.\n     \\]\n   - Simplify the left side: \\(24 \\times 2 = 48 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{47}\\), so the equation becomes:\n     \\[\n     n \\equiv 24 \\times 15 \\pmod{47}.\n     \\]\n\n4. **Compute \\(24 \\times 15\\) modulo \\(47\\)**:\n   - Calculate \\(24 \\times 15 = 360\\).\n   - Divide \\(360\\) by \\(47\\): \\(47 \\times 7 = 329\\), so \\(360 - 329 = 31\\).\n   - Thus, \\(360 \\equiv 31 \\pmod{47}\\), meaning \\(n \\equiv 31 \\pmod{47}\\).\n\n5. **Verification**:\n   - Substitute \\(n = 31\\) into the original congruence: \\(2 \\times 31 = 62\\).\n   - Compute \\(62 \\mod 47\\): \\(62 - 47 = 15\\), so \\(62 \\equiv 15 \\pmod{47}\\), confirming the solution.\n\n**Conclusion**: The solution to \\(2n \\equiv 15 \\pmod{47}\\) is \\(n \\equiv 31 \\pmod{47}\\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  2 * n % 47\nn : \u2115\nh\u2080 : 2 * n % 47 = 15\nh\u2081 : 2 * 24 % 47 = 1\n\u22a2 24 * (2 * n) % 47 = 24 * 15 % 47\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  48 % 47\nn : \u2115\nh\u2080 : 2 * n % 47 = 15\nh\u2081 : 2 * 24 % 47 = 1\nh\u2082 : 24 * 2 * n % 47 = 24 * 15 % 47\nh\u2083 : 48 % 47 = 1\n\u22a2 n % 47 = 31\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  ?a * ?b * ?c\nn : \u2115\nh\u2080 : 2 * n % 47 = 15\nh\u2081 : 2 * 24 % 47 = 1\n\u22a2 24 * (2 * n) % 47 = 24 * 15 % 47\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  2 * 24 % 47\nn : \u2115\nh\u2080 : 2 * n % 47 = 15\nh\u2081 : 2 * 24 % 47 = 1\nh\u2082 : 24 * (2 * n) % 47 = 24 * 15 % 47\n\u22a2 24 * (2 * n) % 47 = 24 * 15 % 47\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  24 * 15 % 47\nn : \u2115\nh\u2080 : 2 * n % 47 = 15\nh\u2081 : 2 * 24 % 47 = 1\nh\u2082 : 24 * (2 * n) % 47 = 24 * 15 % 47\nh\u2083 : 24 * 2 * n % 47 = 24 * 15 % 47\nh\u2084 : 24 * 15 % 47 = 31\n\u22a2 n % 47 = 24 * 2 * n % 47\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unsolved goals\nn : \u2115\nh\u2080 : 2 * n % 47 = 15\nh\u2081 : 2 * 24 % 47 = 1\n\u22a2 n * 48 % 47 = n * 2 % 47 * 24 % 47\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  ?a * ?b * ?c\nn : \u2115\nh\u2080 : 2 * n % 47 = 15\nh\u2081 : 2 * 24 % 47 = 1\nh\u2082 : 24 * (2 * n) % 47 = 24 * 15 % 47\nh\u2083 : 24 * 2 % 47 = 1\n\u22a2 n % 47 = 31\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to prove that for any three positive real numbers x, y, z, the inequality 9/(x+y+z) \u2264 2/(x+y) + 2/(y+z) + 2/(z+x) holds. Let me think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst, I recall that inequalities involving sums and fractions often use techniques like the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, AM-HM inequality, or maybe even the AM-GM inequality. Let me consider each of these possibilities.\n\nThe AM-HM inequality states that for positive real numbers a\u2081, a\u2082, ..., a\u2099, the arithmetic mean is at least the harmonic mean. So, (a\u2081 + a\u2082 + ... + a\u2099)/n \u2265 n/(1/a\u2081 + 1/a\u2082 + ... + 1/a\u2099). But here, the left side of our target inequality is 9/(x+y+z), which is similar to 9 divided by the sum. The right side has terms like 2/(x+y), which are like twice the harmonic mean of pairs. Hmm, maybe there's a way to relate these.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Cauchy-Schwarz could be useful. The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in the form (a\u2081b\u2081 + a\u2082b\u2082 + ... + a\u2099b\u2099)\u00b2 \u2264 (a\u2081\u00b2 + a\u2082\u00b2 + ... + a\u2099\u00b2)(b\u2081\u00b2 + b\u2082\u00b2 + ... + b\u2099\u00b2). But I'm not immediately seeing how to apply that here.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps homogenizing the inequality. Since all terms are homogeneous of degree -1 (the numerator in each fraction is a constant, and the denominator is a sum of variables), maybe we can assume without loss of generality that x + y + z = 1. Then the left side becomes 9, and the right side would be 2/(x+y) + 2/(y+z) + 2/(z+x). But x+y = 1 - z, so substituting that in, the right side becomes 2/(1 - z) + 2/(1 - x) + 2/(1 - y). Not sure if that helps yet.\n\nWait, maybe using substitution. Let me set a = x + y, b = y + z, c = z + x. Then, since x, y, z are positive, a, b, c are also positive. Also, note that a + b + c = 2(x + y + z). So, x + y + z = (a + b + c)/2. Then the left side becomes 9 / [(a + b + c)/2] = 18/(a + b + c). The right side is 2/a + 2/b + 2/c. So the inequality transforms to 18/(a + b + c) \u2264 2(1/a + 1/b + 1/c). Multiplying both sides by (a + b + c)/2, we get 9 \u2264 (a + b + c)(1/a + 1/b + 1/c). Hmm, that seems more manageable.\n\nSo now the problem reduces to proving that for positive real numbers a, b, c, (a + b + c)(1/a + 1/b + 1/c) \u2265 9. Wait, that's a known inequality. The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in the form (a + b + c)(1/a + 1/b + 1/c) \u2265 (1 + 1 + 1)^2 = 9. Exactly! So this inequality holds by Cauchy-Schwarz. Therefore, the original inequality is true.\n\nLet me check this step-by-step again. Starting with the original inequality:\n\n9/(x+y+z) \u2264 2/(x+y) + 2/(y+z) + 2/(z+x).\n\nLet me set a = x + y, b = y + z, c = z + x. Then, as before, a + b + c = 2(x + y + z). So x + y + z = (a + b + c)/2. Substitute into the left side:\n\n9 / [(a + b + c)/2] = 18/(a + b + c).\n\nThe right side is 2/a + 2/b + 2/c = 2(1/a + 1/b + 1/c).\n\nSo the inequality becomes 18/(a + b + c) \u2264 2(1/a + 1/b + 1/c).\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n9/(a + b + c) \u2264 (1/a + 1/b + 1/c).\n\nMultiply both sides by (a + b + c):\n\n9 \u2264 (a + b + c)(1/a + 1/b + 1/c).\n\nNow, by Cauchy-Schwarz, (a + b + c)(1/a + 1/b + 1/c) \u2265 (\u221aa*(1/\u221aa) + \u221ab*(1/\u221ab) + \u221ac*(1/\u221ac))\u00b2 = (1 + 1 + 1)^2 = 9. Therefore, the inequality holds, and equality occurs when a = b = c, which would mean x + y = y + z = z + x, implying x = y = z.\n\nBut the original problem allows any positive real numbers x, y, z, so equality occurs when x = y = z. Therefore, the inequality is proven.\n\nAlternatively, another approach could be using the AM-HM inequality on the denominators. For example, the harmonic mean of (x+y), (y+z), (z+x) is 3/(1/(x+y) + 1/(y+z) + 1/(z+x)), and the arithmetic mean is [(x+y) + (y+z) + (z+x)]/3 = (2x + 2y + 2z)/3 = 2(x + y + z)/3. Then AM \u2265 HM implies that (2(x + y + z)/3) \u2265 3/(1/(x+y) + 1/(y+z) + 1/(z+x)). Rearranging this gives 1/(x+y) + 1/(y+z) + 1/(z+x) \u2265 9/(2(x + y + z)). Multiply both sides by 2: 2/(x+y) + 2/(y+z) + 2/(z+x) \u2265 9/(x + y + z). Which is exactly the inequality we need. So this approach also works using AM-HM.\n\nSo either way, using Cauchy-Schwarz or AM-HM, we can arrive at the desired inequality. Both methods lead to the same conclusion. Therefore, the proof is valid.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nLet's start by rewriting the given inequality in a more manageable form. We need to show that for any positive real numbers \\( x, y, z \\), the inequality  \n\\[\n\\frac{9}{x + y + z} \\leq \\frac{2}{x + y} + \\frac{2}{y + z} + \\frac{2}{z + x}\n\\]\nholds.  \n\n**Step 1: Simplify the inequality using substitutions.**  \nDefine \\( a = x + y \\), \\( b = y + z \\), and \\( c = z + x \\). Notice that \\( a, b, c \\) are all positive since \\( x, y, z \\) are positive. Adding these, we get:\n\\[\na + b + c = (x + y) + (y + z) + (z + x) = 2(x + y + z).\n\\]\nThus, \\( x + y + z = \\frac{a + b + c}{2} \\). Substitute this into the left-hand side of the original inequality:\n\\[\n\\frac{9}{x + y + z} = \\frac{9}{\\frac{a + b + c}{2}} = \\frac{18}{a + b + c}.\n\\]\nThe right-hand side becomes:\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{a} + \\frac{2}{b} + \\frac{2}{c} = 2\\left(\\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{b} + \\frac{1}{c}\\right).\n\\]\nThe inequality now simplifies to:\n\\[\n\\frac{18}{a + b + c} \\leq 2\\left(\\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{b} + \\frac{1}{c}\\right).\n\\]\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\\[\n\\frac{9}{a + b + c} \\leq \\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{b} + \\frac{1}{c}.\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.**  \nThe Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that for positive real numbers \\( p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_n \\) and \\( q_1, q_2, \\dots, q_n \\),\n\\[\n(p_1^2 + p_2^2 + \\dots + p_n^2)(q_1^2 + q_2^2 + \\dots + q_n^2) \\geq (p_1q_1 + p_2q_2 + \\dots + p_nq_n)^2.\n\\]\nHere, let \\( p_1 = \\sqrt{a} \\), \\( p_2 = \\sqrt{b} \\), \\( p_3 = \\sqrt{c} \\) and \\( q_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}} \\), \\( q_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{b}} \\), \\( q_3 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{c}} \\). Applying Cauchy-Schwarz:\n\\[\n(a + b + c)\\left(\\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{b} + \\frac{1}{c}\\right) \\geq \\left(\\sqrt{a} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}} + \\sqrt{b} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{b}} + \\sqrt{c} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{c}}\\right)^2.\n\\]\nSimplifying the right-hand side:\n\\[\n(1 + 1 + 1)^2 = 9.\n\\]\nThus:\n\\[\n(a + b + c)\\left(\\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{b} + \\frac{1}{c}\\right) \\geq 9.\n\\]\nDividing both sides by \\( a + b + c \\), we get:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{b} + \\frac{1}{c} \\geq \\frac{9}{a + b + c}.\n\\]\nThis matches the simplified inequality from Step 1. Therefore, the original inequality holds.  \n\n**Equality Condition:**  \nEquality occurs in Cauchy-Schwarz when \\( \\frac{p_1}{q_1} = \\frac{p_2}{q_2} = \\frac{p_3}{q_3} \\), which here implies \\( a = b = c \\). This means \\( x + y = y + z = z + x \\), leading to \\( x = y = z \\).

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the inverse of 24 modulo 11 squared, which is 121. That means I need to find an integer b such that 24 times b is congruent to 1 modulo 121. The answer is supposed to be 116, but I need to figure out how to get there.\n\nFirst, let me recall that finding an inverse modulo n means solving the equation 24b \u2261 1 mod 121. Since 24 and 121 need to be coprime for the inverse to exist, I should check their greatest common divisor. Let's see, 121 is 11 squared, and 24 is 8*3. 11 is a prime number, and it doesn't divide 24, so gcd(24, 121) should be 1. That means the inverse does exist.\n\nNow, how do I find this inverse? One method I remember is the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which finds integers x and y such that 24x + 121y = 1. The x here would be the inverse. Let me try applying that.\n\nBut maybe there's a smarter way since 121 is 11 squared. Sometimes, if you know the inverse modulo a prime, you can lift it to the inverse modulo the prime squared using Hensel's lemma or some similar technique. Let me think about that.\n\nFirst, find the inverse of 24 modulo 11. Since 24 mod 11 is 24 - 2*11 = 24 - 22 = 2. So, the inverse of 24 mod 11 is the same as the inverse of 2 mod 11. The inverse of 2 mod 11 is 6 because 2*6=12 \u22611 mod11. So, the inverse of 24 mod11 is 6.\n\nNow, to lift this to mod 121. Let's denote the inverse as b = 6 + 11k for some integer k. Then, we need 24b \u22611 mod121. Let's substitute b:\n\n24*(6 + 11k) \u2261 24*6 + 24*11k \u2261 144 + 264k mod121.\n\nBut 144 mod121 is 144 - 121 = 23. And 264k mod121: since 264 divided by 121 is 2*121=242, so 264 = 242 +22, so 264 \u226122 mod121. Therefore, 264k \u226122k mod121.\n\nSo the equation becomes 23 +22k \u22611 mod121. Subtract 23 from both sides: 22k \u2261 -22 mod121. Which is the same as 22k \u226199 mod121 (since -22 +121=99). So 22k \u226199 mod121.\n\nNow, divide both sides by 11. 22 is 2*11, 99 is 9*11, and 121 is 11^2. So dividing the congruence by 11 gives 2k \u22619 mod11. Now, solve for k: 2k \u22619 mod11. The inverse of 2 mod11 is 6 again, so multiply both sides by 6: k \u22619*6=54\u226154-44=10 mod11. So k=10 +11m for some integer m.\n\nBut since we're working mod121, and our initial b was 6 +11k, substituting k=10 gives b=6 +11*10=6+110=116. So the inverse is 116 mod121. Let me check that.\n\n24*116 = 24*(100 +16) = 2400 + 384 = 2784. Now divide 2784 by 121. 121*23=2783, so 2784 -2783=1. Therefore, 24*116=2784\u22611 mod121. Yep, that works. So the answer is 116.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo find the inverse of \\(24\\) modulo \\(11^2 = 121\\), we need an integer \\(b\\) such that \\(24b \\equiv 1 \\pmod{121}\\). Here's how to solve this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Simplify the problem modulo \\(11\\) first**:\n   - Compute \\(24 \\pmod{11}\\): \\(24 - 2 \\cdot 11 = 2\\), so \\(24 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{11}\\).\n   - The inverse of \\(2 \\pmod{11}\\) is \\(6\\) because \\(2 \\cdot 6 = 12 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}\\). Thus, the inverse of \\(24 \\pmod{11}\\) is \\(6\\).\n\n2. **Lift the solution to modulo \\(11^2\\)**:\n   - Let \\(b = 6 + 11k\\), where \\(k\\) is an integer to be determined. Substitute into \\(24b \\equiv 1 \\pmod{121}\\):\n     \\[\n     24(6 + 11k) = 144 + 264k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{121}.\n     \\]\n   - Reduce \\(144 \\pmod{121}\\): \\(144 - 121 = 23\\), so \\(144 \\equiv 23 \\pmod{121}\\).\n   - Reduce \\(264k \\pmod{121}\\): \\(264 = 2 \\cdot 121 + 22\\), so \\(264k \\equiv 22k \\pmod{121}\\).\n   - Combine terms: \\(23 + 22k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{121}\\).\n   - Rearrange: \\(22k \\equiv -22 \\pmod{121}\\). Since \\(-22 \\equiv 99 \\pmod{121}\\), this simplifies to \\(22k \\equiv 99 \\pmod{121}\\).\n\n3. **Solve for \\(k\\)**:\n   - Divide the congruence by \\(11\\) (valid because \\(11\\) divides \\(22\\) and \\(99\\)):\n     \\[\n     2k \\equiv 9 \\pmod{11}.\n     \\]\n   - Multiply both sides by the inverse of \\(2 \\pmod{11}\\), which is \\(6\\):\n     \\[\n     k \\equiv 9 \\cdot 6 = 54 \\equiv 10 \\pmod{11}.\n     \\]\n   - Thus, \\(k = 10 + 11m\\) for some integer \\(m\\). Substitute back into \\(b = 6 + 11k\\):\n     \\[\n     b = 6 + 11 \\cdot 10 = 116.\n     \\]\n\n4. **Verify**:\n   - Compute \\(24 \\cdot 116 = 2784\\).\n   - Divide \\(2784\\) by \\(121\\): \\(121 \\cdot 23 = 2783\\), so \\(2784 - 2783 = 1\\).\n   - Hence, \\(24 \\cdot 116 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{121}\\), confirming \\(b = 116\\) is the correct inverse.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  b\nb : ZMod (11 ^ 2)\nh\u2080 : b = 24\u207b\u00b9\nh\u2081 : 24 = 24\n\u22a2 b = 116\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to prove that for any real numbers a and b, the inequality |a + b| / (1 + |a + b|) \u2264 |a| / (1 + |a|) + |b| / (1 + |b|) holds. Hmm. Alright, where do I start?\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with absolute values and inequalities, triangle inequality is often useful. The triangle inequality says that |a + b| \u2264 |a| + |b|. Maybe that can help here. But the denominators complicate things. Let me think about how to handle the fractions.\n\nThe left side of the inequality is |a + b| divided by (1 + |a + b|), and the right side is the sum of two similar terms. Maybe there's a way to relate these fractions using the triangle inequality. Let's try to manipulate the left side using the triangle inequality first.\n\nSince |a + b| \u2264 |a| + |b|, then 1 + |a + b| \u2264 1 + |a| + |b|. Wait, but how does that help with the fraction? If the numerator is smaller or equal to |a| + |b|, and the denominator is also smaller or equal to 1 + |a| + |b|, maybe I can compare |a + b|/(1 + |a + b|) to (|a| + |b|)/(1 + |a| + |b|). But the right side of the original inequality is |a|/(1 + |a|) + |b|/(1 + |b|), which is different from (|a| + |b|)/(1 + |a| + |b|). Hmm, maybe that's not the right path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the function f(x) = x / (1 + x). Let's see its behavior. For x \u2265 0, f(x) is increasing because the derivative f\u2019(x) = 1/(1 + x)^2, which is positive. So if x \u2264 y, then f(x) \u2264 f(y). Since |a + b| \u2264 |a| + |b|, then f(|a + b|) \u2264 f(|a| + |b|). But the right side of the original inequality is f(|a|) + f(|b|). So maybe I need to show that f(|a| + |b|) \u2264 f(|a|) + f(|b|). Wait, is that true?\n\nLet me test with some numbers. Suppose |a| = 1 and |b| = 1. Then f(1 + 1) = 2/3, and f(1) + f(1) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. So 2/3 \u2264 1, which holds. Another example: |a| = 0, |b| = 0. Then left side is 0/(1+0) = 0, right side is 0 + 0 = 0. Equality holds. If |a| = 2, |b| = 3. Then f(5) = 5/6, and f(2) + f(3) = 2/3 + 3/4 = 17/12 \u2248 1.4167, which is larger than 5/6 \u2248 0.8333. So the inequality seems to hold in these cases. So maybe f(|a| + |b|) \u2264 f(|a|) + f(|b|) is true. If that's the case, then combining with the triangle inequality, since |a + b| \u2264 |a| + |b|, and f is increasing, then f(|a + b|) \u2264 f(|a| + |b|) \u2264 f(|a|) + f(|b|). Therefore, the original inequality would hold.\n\nBut wait, I need to confirm that f(|a| + |b|) \u2264 f(|a|) + f(|b|). Let's try to prove that. Let x = |a| and y = |b|. Then the inequality becomes (x + y)/(1 + x + y) \u2264 x/(1 + x) + y/(1 + y). Let's compute the right side: x/(1 + x) + y/(1 + y) = [x(1 + y) + y(1 + x)] / [(1 + x)(1 + y)] = [x + xy + y + xy] / [(1 + x)(1 + y)] = [x + y + 2xy] / [(1 + x)(1 + y)].\n\nCompare this to the left side: (x + y)/(1 + x + y). Let's cross-multiply to see if (x + y)(1 + x)(1 + y) \u2264 (x + y + 2xy)(1 + x + y). Wait, but this seems messy. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that for non-negative x and y, (x + y)/(1 + x + y) \u2264 x/(1 + x) + y/(1 + y). Let me rearrange the inequality:\n\n(x + y)/(1 + x + y) \u2264 x/(1 + x) + y/(1 + y)\n\nMultiply both sides by (1 + x + y)(1 + x)(1 + y) to eliminate denominators. Let's see:\n\nLeft side: (x + y)(1 + x)(1 + y)\n\nRight side: [x(1 + y) + y(1 + x)](1 + x + y) = [x + xy + y + xy](1 + x + y) = (x + y + 2xy)(1 + x + y)\n\nSo the inequality becomes:\n\n(x + y)(1 + x)(1 + y) \u2264 (x + y + 2xy)(1 + x + y)\n\nExpand both sides:\n\nLeft side: (x + y)(1 + x + y + xy) = (x + y) + (x + y)x + (x + y)y + (x + y)xy = x + y + x\u00b2 + xy + xy + y\u00b2 + x\u00b2y + xy\u00b2\n\nWait, maybe expanding step by step:\n\nFirst, (1 + x)(1 + y) = 1 + x + y + xy. Then multiply by (x + y):\n\n(x + y)(1 + x + y + xy) = x(1 + x + y + xy) + y(1 + x + y + xy) = x + x\u00b2 + xy + x\u00b2y + y + xy + y\u00b2 + xy\u00b2 = x + y + x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2xy + x\u00b2y + xy\u00b2\n\nRight side: (x + y + 2xy)(1 + x + y) = (x + y)(1 + x + y) + 2xy(1 + x + y) = (x + y) + x(x + y) + y(x + y) + 2xy + 2x\u00b2y + 2xy\u00b2\n\nWait, let's compute it properly:\n\nFirst, expand (x + y + 2xy)(1 + x + y):\n\n= x(1) + x(x) + x(y) + y(1) + y(x) + y(y) + 2xy(1) + 2xy(x) + 2xy(y)\n\n= x + x\u00b2 + xy + y + xy + y\u00b2 + 2xy + 2x\u00b2y + 2xy\u00b2\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n= x + y + x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + (xy + xy + 2xy) + 2x\u00b2y + 2xy\u00b2\n\n= x + y + x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 4xy + 2x\u00b2y + 2xy\u00b2\n\nNow compare left and right sides:\n\nLeft side after expansion: x + y + x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2xy + x\u00b2y + xy\u00b2\n\nRight side after expansion: x + y + x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 4xy + 2x\u00b2y + 2xy\u00b2\n\nSubtract left side from right side:\n\n( x + y + x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 4xy + 2x\u00b2y + 2xy\u00b2 ) - ( x + y + x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2xy + x\u00b2y + xy\u00b2 ) = 2xy + x\u00b2y + xy\u00b2\n\nWhich is equal to xy(2 + x + y). Since x and y are non-negative, this is non-negative. Therefore, the right side minus left side is non-negative, which implies that the original inequality (x + y)/(1 + x + y) \u2264 x/(1 + x) + y/(1 + y) holds for all non-negative x and y.\n\nTherefore, combining this with the triangle inequality:\n\n|a + b| \u2264 |a| + |b| \u21d2 f(|a + b|) \u2264 f(|a| + |b|) \u2264 f(|a|) + f(|b|)\n\nHence, the original inequality holds.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure that the step where I use f(|a| + |b|) \u2264 f(|a|) + f(|b|) is valid. The previous expansion shows that (x + y)/(1 + x + y) \u2264 x/(1 + x) + y/(1 + y), which is exactly the inequality needed. So yes, that step is valid.\n\nTherefore, the proof would go like this:\n\n1. Start with the triangle inequality: |a + b| \u2264 |a| + |b|.\n\n2. Since the function f(x) = x/(1 + x) is increasing for x \u2265 0, applying f to both sides gives f(|a + b|) \u2264 f(|a| + |b|).\n\n3. Then, show that f(|a| + |b|) \u2264 f(|a|) + f(|b|) by proving (x + y)/(1 + x + y) \u2264 x/(1 + x) + y/(1 + y) for non-negative x and y.\n\n4. Combining these two inequalities gives the desired result.\n\nI think that works. Let me check with another example. Let a = 3, b = -2. Then |a + b| = |1| = 1. Left side: 1/(1+1) = 0.5. Right side: 3/(1+3) + 2/(1+2) = 0.75 + 0.666... \u2248 1.4167. So 0.5 \u2264 1.4167, which holds. Another example: a = -1, b = 0.5. |a + b| = | -0.5 | = 0.5. Left side: 0.5/1.5 \u2248 0.333. Right side: 1/(1+1) + 0.5/(1+0.5) = 0.5 + 0.333 \u2248 0.833. So 0.333 \u2264 0.833, which holds. Seems consistent.\n\nSo the key steps are using the triangle inequality and the property of the function f(x) = x/(1 + x) being increasing, then proving that f(x + y) \u2264 f(x) + f(y) for non-negative x and y. That seems to cover it.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo show that for any real numbers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), the inequality  \n\\[\n\\frac{|a+b|}{1+|a+b|} \\leq \\frac{|a|}{1+|a|} + \\frac{|b|}{1+|b|}\n\\]\nholds, we can break the proof into three key steps:\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Use the Triangle Inequality**\nThe triangle inequality states that for any real numbers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\):  \n\\[\n|a + b| \\leq |a| + |b|.\n\\]\nThis tells us that the absolute value of the sum \\( a + b \\) is bounded by the sum of the absolute values of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Function \\( f(x) = \\frac{x}{1+x} \\)**\nConsider the function \\( f(x) = \\frac{x}{1+x} \\) for \\( x \\geq 0 \\). This function has two important properties:  \n1. **Monotonicity**: \\( f(x) \\) is strictly increasing for \\( x \\geq 0 \\).  \n   - *Reason*: The derivative \\( f'(x) = \\frac{1}{(1+x)^2} \\) is always positive for \\( x \\geq 0 \\).  \n2. **Subadditivity**: For non-negative \\( x \\) and \\( y \\),  \n   \\[\n   f(x + y) \\leq f(x) + f(y).\n   \\]\n   - *Proof of Subadditivity*:  \n     Expand the inequality \\( \\frac{x + y}{1 + x + y} \\leq \\frac{x}{1 + x} + \\frac{y}{1 + y} \\).  \n     Cross-multiplying and simplifying shows that the inequality reduces to \\( 2xy + x^2y + xy^2 \\geq 0 \\), which is always true for non-negative \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Combine the Results**\n1. From the triangle inequality (Step 1), \\( |a + b| \\leq |a| + |b| \\).  \n2. Apply \\( f \\) to both sides. Since \\( f \\) is increasing (Step 2), we get:  \n   \\[\n   f(|a + b|) \\leq f(|a| + |b|).\n   \\]\n3.

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, we have four odd integers a, b, c, d with 0 < a < b < c < d, and they satisfy ad = bc. Also, a + d is a power of two (2^k) and b + c is another power of two (2^m). We need to prove that a must be 1.\n\nFirst, let's recall that all four numbers are odd. The product of two odds is odd, but here ad = bc. Wait, but if a, b, c, d are all odd, then ad and bc are both products of two odds, which are odd. So ad and bc are both odd. That's consistent.\n\nGiven that a < b < c < d, and they're all positive integers. The key equations are ad = bc, a + d = 2^k, and b + c = 2^m. The goal is to show a = 1.\n\nLet me think about the equation ad = bc. Since a, b, c, d are positive integers with a < b < c < d, maybe we can express d in terms of a, b, c. From ad = bc, we get d = (bc)/a. Since d must be an integer, a divides bc. But a, b, c are all odd, so their product is odd, and a divides bc. Since a is odd, this division is possible only if a divides bc. But how does that help?\n\nAlso, a + d = 2^k. Since a and d are both odd, their sum is even, which matches 2^k being even (except when k=0, but 2^0=1, which is odd. Wait, but a and d are positive integers greater than 0, and a < d, so a + d is at least 1 + 3 = 4, so k must be at least 2. So 2^k is even, which matches a + d being even.\n\nSimilarly, b + c = 2^m. Since b and c are odd, their sum is even, so 2^m is even, so m is at least 1.\n\nNow, let's think about the equation a + d = 2^k. Since d = (bc)/a from ad = bc, substituting into a + d gives a + (bc)/a = 2^k. Multiply both sides by a to eliminate the denominator: a^2 + bc = a * 2^k. Hmm, not sure if that's helpful yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use the fact that a + d and b + c are both powers of two. Let's consider that powers of two have only 2 as their prime factor. So, a + d and b + c are both sums of two odd numbers, which are even, so they must be multiples of 2, but since they are powers of two, they can't have any other prime factors. That might be important.\n\nLet me think about possible small values. Suppose a = 1. Then d = 2^k - 1. Since d must be odd, which it is because 2^k is even, so 2^k -1 is odd. Then, from ad = bc, which becomes 1*d = bc, so d = bc. But d is the largest number, so bc must be equal to d. But since b and c are both greater than a=1, so b >=3, c >=5, then bc >=15, but d would be bc, which is larger than c, which is already larger than b. So that's possible. But how does this help us conclude that a must be 1?\n\nWait, the problem states that if such a, b, c, d exist with those conditions, then a must be 1. So maybe we need to show that a cannot be greater than 1. Let's suppose for contradiction that a is an odd integer greater than 1, say a=3, and see if we can find a contradiction.\n\nAssume a >=3. Then d = 2^k - a. Since a is odd and 2^k is even, d is odd. Also, d must be greater than c, which is greater than b, which is greater than a. So d > c > b > a >=3.\n\nFrom ad = bc, we have 3d = bc. Since d = 2^k -3, then 3(2^k -3) = bc. But b and c are both greater than 3, so bc >= (5)(7)=35. So 3(2^k -3) >=35. Let's see: 2^k -3 >=35/3 \u224811.666..., so 2^k >=14.666..., so k >=4 (since 2^4=16). Then d=16-3=13. So 3*13=39=bc. So possible b and c would be factors of 39 greater than 3. The factors of 39 are 1,3,13,39. But b and c must be between a=3 and d=13. So possible pairs (b,c) could be (3,13), but b must be greater than a=3, so b=13 is not possible because c would have to be greater than 13, but d=13. So this doesn't work. Hence, maybe a=3 is not possible.\n\nBut this is just an example. Maybe there's a general approach here.\n\nLet's consider the equation ad = bc. Since a, b, c, d are all positive integers with a < b < c < d, and all are odd. Let's write a, b, c, d as:\n\na = 2p +1, b=2q +1, c=2r +1, d=2s +1, where p, q, r, s are non-negative integers. But since a >=1, p >=0, etc.\n\nBut maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, since a + d = 2^k, which is a power of two, and a and d are both odd, their sum is even. Similarly for b + c.\n\nLet me think about the equation ad = bc. Let's rearrange it as a/d = b/c. Wait, but a < b < c < d, so a/d is less than b/c? Not sure. Alternatively, cross-multiplying gives a d = b c. Since a < b and c < d, perhaps there's a way to relate these terms.\n\nAlternatively, since a + d = 2^k and b + c = 2^m, maybe we can use the fact that these sums are powers of two. Let's consider that in a sum of two numbers being a power of two, the numbers must be co-prime? Because if they had a common divisor greater than 1, then the sum would also be divisible by that divisor, but a power of two is only divisible by 2. So if a and d have a common divisor greater than 1, then 2^k would be divisible by that divisor, which must be a power of two. But since a and d are both odd, their greatest common divisor must be odd. The only odd divisor of a power of two is 1. Therefore, a and d must be coprime. Similarly, b and c must be coprime.\n\nSo gcd(a,d) =1 and gcd(b,c)=1.\n\nThat's a useful observation. Because if a and d are coprime, then in the equation ad = bc, since a divides bc and gcd(a,d)=1, then a must divide b or a must divide c. But wait, since a < b < c, a cannot divide b unless a=1. Because if a divides b, then b = a * k for some integer k >1 (since b >a). But if a is greater than 1, then b would be a multiple of a, but since a and d are coprime, and d is greater than c which is greater than b, perhaps this leads to a contradiction.\n\nWait, let's think again. Since a divides bc and gcd(a,d)=1, and a divides bc, but since gcd(a,d)=1 and d = bc/a (from ad=bc), then a must divide bc. But since a and d are coprime, and d = bc/a, then a must divide bc. But because gcd(a,d)=1, and d = bc/a, then a must divide bc, and since a and bc/a are coprime, then a must divide the product bc, and since a is coprime with d = bc/a, then a must divide the product bc, but since a is coprime with bc/a, then a must divide the product bc and be coprime with bc/a. This seems a bit tangled. Maybe using the fact that a and d are coprime, so a divides bc, and since a and d are coprime, and d = bc/a, then a must divide bc, and since a and bc/a are coprime, then a must divide the product bc, but a and bc/a are coprime, so a must be 1. Wait, maybe that's the key.\n\nAlternatively, since a and d are coprime, and a divides bc, then a must divide b or a must divide c. But since a < b and a < c, if a divides b, then b = a * m for some m >1. Similarly, if a divides c, then c = a * n for some n >1. But let's explore this.\n\nCase 1: a divides b. Then b = a * m, where m is an integer greater than 1 (since b >a). Similarly, since ad = bc, substituting b = a m gives ad = a m c \u21d2 d = m c. But d must be greater than c, so m must be at least 2. But d = m c, and since c > b = a m, then d = m c > m * a m = a m\u00b2. But a is at least 1, so d is at least m\u00b2. But d is also equal to 2^k - a. So 2^k - a = m c. But c is greater than b = a m, so c >= a m +1 (since they are integers). Therefore, d = m c >= m (a m +1) = a m\u00b2 + m. But d = 2^k - a, so 2^k - a >= a m\u00b2 + m. Rearranging, 2^k >= a (m\u00b2 +1) + m. Since a >=1 and m >=2, this would require 2^k to be quite large. But even if a=1, m=2, then 2^k >=1*(4 +1) +2=7, so k >=3. But this might not lead to a contradiction. However, if a >1, then the right-hand side increases, making 2^k even larger. But how does this help us conclude that a must be 1?\n\nAlternatively, since a and d are coprime, and a divides bc, then a must divide either b or c. Suppose a divides b. Then b = a m. Then d = m c. But since d = 2^k - a, substituting gives m c = 2^k - a. Also, from b + c = 2^m, which is a m + c = 2^m. So c = 2^m - a m. Substitute into d = m c: d = m (2^m - a m). But d is also 2^k - a. So:\n\nm (2^m - a m) = 2^k - a\n\nLet's rearrange:\n\nm * 2^m - a m\u00b2 = 2^k - a\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\nm * 2^m - 2^k = a m\u00b2 - a\n\nFactor a on the right:\n\nm * 2^m - 2^k = a (m\u00b2 -1)\n\nSo:\n\na = (m * 2^m - 2^k) / (m\u00b2 -1)\n\nSince a must be a positive integer, the numerator must be divisible by the denominator. Let's see if this is possible for a >1.\n\nSuppose a=3. Then:\n\n3 = (m * 2^m - 2^k)/(m\u00b2 -1)\n\nSo m * 2^m - 2^k =3(m\u00b2 -1)\n\nBut this seems complicated. Let's try small m values.\n\nIf m=2:\n\nLeft side: 2*2^2 -2^k =8 -2^k\n\nRight side:3*(4-1)=9\n\nSo 8 -2^k=9 \u21d2 -2^k=1 \u21d2 impossible.\n\nIf m=3:\n\nLeft:3*8 -2^k=24 -2^k\n\nRight:3*(9-1)=24\n\nSo 24 -2^k=24 \u21d22^k=0 \u21d2 impossible.\n\nm=4:\n\nLeft:4*16 -2^k=64 -2^k\n\nRight:3*(16-1)=45\n\nSo 64 -2^k=45 \u21d22^k=19 \u21d2 not a power of two.\n\nm=1: But m must be at least 2 since b =a m >a.\n\nSo for a=3, no solution. Similarly, trying a=5:\n\na=5:\n\n5=(m*2^m -2^k)/(m\u00b2 -1)\n\nSo m*2^m -2^k=5(m\u00b2 -1)\n\nAgain, trying m=2:\n\nLeft:8 -2^k=5*(4-1)=15 \u21d28 -2^k=15 \u21d2-2^k=7 \u21d2 impossible.\n\nm=3:\n\n24 -2^k=5*(9-1)=40 \u21d2-2^k=16 \u21d2 impossible.\n\nm=4:\n\n64 -2^k=5*(16-1)=75 \u21d2-2^k=11 \u21d2 impossible.\n\nSo no solutions here. This suggests that when a>1, there are no solutions, hence a must be 1.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the case when a=1. Then d=2^k -1. From ad=bc, we have 1*d=bc \u21d2 d=bc. Since d>c, bc must be greater than c, which implies b>1. Which is true since b>a=1. So possible. For example, let's say a=1, then d=2^k -1. Let's pick k=3, so d=7. Then bc=7. Since b and c are odd integers greater than 1 and less than d=7, possible b=3, c=7/3 which is not integer. Not possible. Next k=4, d=15. Then bc=15. Possible pairs (b,c): (3,5). Then check if b + c =8=2^3. Yes, 3+5=8=2^3. So here, a=1, b=3, c=5, d=15. Then a+d=16=2^4, and b+c=8=2^3. This satisfies all conditions. So this works. Hence, a=1 is possible.\n\nBut the problem states that if such conditions are met, then a=1. So we need to show that a cannot be greater than 1.\n\nAnother approach: Since a and d are coprime (as their sum is a power of two, which implies they are coprime), and ad=bc, then a divides bc. Since a is coprime with d, and d=bc/a, then a must divide bc. But since a is coprime with d=bc/a, then a must divide the product bc, and since a is coprime with bc/a, then a must divide the product bc and be coprime with bc/a. This implies that a must divide the greatest common divisor of b and c. But since b and c are coprime (as their sum is a power of two), then gcd(b,c)=1. Therefore, a must divide 1, so a=1.\n\nWait, that seems promising. Let's elaborate:\n\nFrom the equation ad=bc, and since a and d are coprime (because their sum is a power of two, which requires them to be coprime), then a divides bc. Because a divides bc and gcd(a,d)=1, and d=bc/a, then a must divide bc. But since a and d are coprime, and d=bc/a, then a must divide bc, and bc/a must be coprime with a. Therefore, the factors of a must be entirely in bc, but since a and bc/a are coprime, the only common divisor between a and bc/a is 1. Therefore, a must divide bc, and the factors of a must be in either b or c, but not both. However, since b and c are coprime (as their sum is a power of two, hence they must be coprime), then a must divide either b or c. But since a < b and a < c, if a divides b, then b= a * m for some m>1. Similarly, if a divides c, then c= a * n for some n>1. However, let's consider both cases.\n\nCase 1: a divides b. Then b= a * m. Then from ad=bc, we have a d = a m c \u21d2 d= m c. Since d > c, m must be at least 2. Now, since a + d =2^k, substituting d= m c gives a + m c =2^k. Also, b + c = a m + c =2^m. From this, we can express c=2^m - a m. Substitute into the first equation: a + m (2^m - a m) =2^k. Simplify:\n\na + m *2^m - a m\u00b2 =2^k\n\na (1 - m\u00b2) + m *2^m =2^k\n\nRearranged:\n\na (m\u00b2 -1) = m *2^m -2^k\n\nSince a must be a positive integer, the right-hand side must be positive. So m *2^m >2^k. Also, since m >=2, let's see possible values.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Let's instead consider that since b and c are coprime (as their sum is a power of two), and a divides one of them, but a is less than both. If a divides b, then b= a m, and since gcd(b,c)=1, then a must be 1. Because if a>1, then a would be a common divisor of b and a, but since gcd(b,c)=1, a must be 1. Similarly, if a divides c, then c= a n, and since gcd(b,c)=1, a must be 1. Therefore, in either case, a must be 1.\n\nYes, that's the key. Since a divides either b or c, and gcd(b,c)=1, then a must be 1. Because if a divides b and a>1, then a would be a common divisor of b and a, but since gcd(b,c)=1, and a divides b, then a must also divide gcd(b,c)=1, hence a=1. Similarly if a divides c.\n\nTherefore, the only possibility is a=1.\n</think>\n\n#",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, we have four positive integers K, L, M, N where K > L > M > N. The equation given is KM + LN = (K + L - M + N)(-K + L + M + N). We need to prove that KL + MN is not prime. Hmm, that's interesting. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's write down the equation again to make sure I have it right: KM + LN equals the product of two terms, (K + L - M + N) and (-K + L + M + N). My goal is to show that KL + MN is composite. Maybe I can manipulate the given equation to express KL + MN in terms of other variables or find a factorization.\n\nLet me start by expanding the right-hand side of the equation. Let's denote the first term as A = K + L - M + N and the second term as B = -K + L + M + N. Then, the product AB would be (K + L - M + N)(-K + L + M + N). Let's multiply these out.\n\nMultiplying A and B:\nFirst, expand using distributive property:\n= K*(-K) + K*L + K*M + K*N + L*(-K) + L*L + L*M + L*N - M*(-K) - M*L - M*M - M*N + N*(-K) + N*L + N*M + N*N\n\nWait, that's going to be messy. Maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, notice that (a + b)(c + d) = ac + ad + bc + bd. But perhaps there's a pattern here. Let me see:\n\nA = (K + L) + (-M + N)\nB = (-K + L) + (M + N)\n\nAlternatively, maybe group terms differently. Alternatively, recognize that this is of the form (P + Q)(P - Q) where P and Q are some expressions. Let me check:\n\nWait, (K + L - M + N)(-K + L + M + N). Let's rearrange terms:\n\n= [ (L + N) + (K - M) ] * [ (L + N) - (K - M) ]\n\nYes! That's a difference of squares. Because (X + Y)(X - Y) = X\u00b2 - Y\u00b2. So here, X = L + N and Y = K - M. Therefore, the product AB is (L + N)\u00b2 - (K - M)\u00b2.\n\nSo, expanding that, AB = (L + N)^2 - (K - M)^2.\n\nSo the original equation becomes:\n\nKM + LN = (L + N)^2 - (K - M)^2.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nKM + LN = (L + N)^2 - (K - M)^2.\n\nNow, let's expand the right-hand side:\n\n(L + N)^2 = L\u00b2 + 2LN + N\u00b2\n\n(K - M)^2 = K\u00b2 - 2KM + M\u00b2\n\nSo, subtracting them:\n\n(L\u00b2 + 2LN + N\u00b2) - (K\u00b2 - 2KM + M\u00b2) = L\u00b2 + 2LN + N\u00b2 - K\u00b2 + 2KM - M\u00b2\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\nKM + LN = L\u00b2 + 2LN + N\u00b2 - K\u00b2 + 2KM - M\u00b2\n\nLet's bring all terms to one side to see if we can simplify:\n\nKM + LN - L\u00b2 - 2LN - N\u00b2 + K\u00b2 - 2KM + M\u00b2 = 0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nKM - 2KM = -KM\n\nLN - 2LN = -LN\n\nSo:\n\n-KM - LN - L\u00b2 - N\u00b2 + K\u00b2 + M\u00b2 = 0\n\nRearranged:\n\nK\u00b2 - L\u00b2 + M\u00b2 - N\u00b2 - KM - LN = 0\n\nHmm, not sure if that's helpful yet. Maybe factor terms. Let's see:\n\nK\u00b2 - L\u00b2 = (K - L)(K + L)\n\nM\u00b2 - N\u00b2 = (M - N)(M + N)\n\nSo:\n\n(K - L)(K + L) + (M - N)(M + N) - KM - LN = 0\n\nNot sure if that helps. Maybe another approach. Let's recall that we need to find KL + MN and show it's not prime. Maybe express KL + MN in terms of other variables.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to manipulate the original equation to express KL + MN. Let's see:\n\nOriginal equation: KM + LN = (K + L - M + N)(-K + L + M + N)\n\nWe can write this as KM + LN = AB, where A = K + L - M + N and B = -K + L + M + N.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express KL + MN in terms of A and B. Let's see:\n\nLet me compute KL + MN. Let's see if there's a relation between KL + MN and the given equation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe express KL + MN as a product of two numbers, which would show it's composite. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to find expressions for A and B in terms of KL + MN or other combinations.\n\nWait, let's compute A + B and A - B to see if that helps.\n\nA = K + L - M + N\n\nB = -K + L + M + N\n\nA + B = (K - K) + (L + L) + (-M + M) + (N + N) = 0 + 2L + 0 + 2N = 2(L + N)\n\nA - B = (K + L - M + N) - (-K + L + M + N) = K + L - M + N + K - L - M - N = 2K - 2M\n\nSo, A + B = 2(L + N)\n\nA - B = 2(K - M)\n\nTherefore, from these, we can express L + N = (A + B)/2 and K - M = (A - B)/2.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's helpful yet. Let's go back to the original equation.\n\nWe have KM + LN = AB. And we need to relate this to KL + MN.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express KL + MN in terms of A and B. Let's see:\n\nKL + MN = K*L + M*N\n\nBut how to relate this to A and B? Let's see:\n\nA = K + L - M + N\n\nB = -K + L + M + N\n\nLet me try to express KL + MN in terms of A and B. Maybe by solving for K, L, M, N in terms of A and B, but that might be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that KL + MN can be written as K*L + M*N. Let's see if there's a way to factor this expression or relate it to the given equation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the given equation to substitute for KM or LN. For example, from KM + LN = AB, maybe express LN = AB - KM and substitute into KL + MN. But that gives KL + MN = KL + MN, which doesn't help directly.\n\nWait, maybe we can find another relation. Let's think about the variables. Since K > L > M > N, all variables are positive integers decreasing. Maybe there's a substitution or inequality we can use.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider specific values to test. For example, take K=4, L=3, M=2, N=1. Then check if the equation holds and see what KL + MN is. But this might not be general, but could give insight.\n\nLet's try K=4, L=3, M=2, N=1.\n\nLeft side: KM + LN = 4*2 + 3*1 = 8 + 3 = 11\n\nRight side: (4 + 3 - 2 + 1)(-4 + 3 + 2 + 1) = (6)(2) = 12\n\nBut 11 \u2260 12, so this doesn't satisfy the equation. So this choice doesn't work. Let's try another set.\n\nMaybe K=5, L=4, M=3, N=2.\n\nLeft: 5*3 +4*2=15+8=23\n\nRight: (5+4-3+2)(-5+4+3+2)= (8)(4)=32\n\n23\u226032. Not equal. Hmm.\n\nAnother try: K=3, L=2, M=1, N=0. But N must be positive, so N=0 is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, K=5, L=3, M=2, N=1.\n\nLeft:5*2 +3*1=10+3=13\n\nRight: (5+3-2+1)(-5+3+2+1)= (7)(1)=7\n\n13\u22607. Not equal.\n\nHmm, maybe it's hard to find examples. Maybe the equation implies certain constraints on the variables. Let's think algebraically again.\n\nWe have KM + LN = (K + L - M + N)(-K + L + M + N)\n\nLet me try to rearrange the equation:\n\nKM + LN = (L + N + K - M)(L + N - K + M)\n\nWait, that's similar to (A + B)(A - B) = A\u00b2 - B\u00b2 where A = L + N and B = K - M. So, as I did before, the right-hand side is (L + N)^2 - (K - M)^2.\n\nSo, KM + LN = (L + N)^2 - (K - M)^2\n\nLet me rearrange this equation:\n\nKM + LN + (K - M)^2 = (L + N)^2\n\nExpand (K - M)^2: K\u00b2 - 2KM + M\u00b2\n\nSo:\n\nKM + LN + K\u00b2 - 2KM + M\u00b2 = (L + N)^2\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nK\u00b2 - KM + M\u00b2 + LN = L\u00b2 + 2LN + N\u00b2\n\nBring all terms to left side:\n\nK\u00b2 - KM + M\u00b2 + LN - L\u00b2 - 2LN - N\u00b2 = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\nK\u00b2 - L\u00b2 + M\u00b2 - N\u00b2 - KM - LN = 0\n\nHmm, same as before. Maybe factor this expression.\n\nK\u00b2 - L\u00b2 = (K - L)(K + L)\n\nM\u00b2 - N\u00b2 = (M - N)(M + N)\n\nSo:\n\n(K - L)(K + L) + (M - N)(M + N) - KM - LN = 0\n\nNot sure. Let's see if we can group terms differently.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that KL + MN is the expression we need to show is composite. Maybe express KL + MN in terms of other variables.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to find a relationship between KL + MN and the given equation. Let's see:\n\nFrom the original equation, KM + LN = (K + L - M + N)(-K + L + M + N)\n\nLet me denote the right-hand side as AB, where A = K + L - M + N and B = -K + L + M + N.\n\nWe need to relate KL + MN to AB. Maybe express KL + MN in terms of A and B.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute A + B and A - B again:\n\nA + B = (K + L - M + N) + (-K + L + M + N) = 2L + 2N = 2(L + N)\n\nA - B = (K + L - M + N) - (-K + L + M + N) = 2K - 2M = 2(K - M)\n\nSo, L + N = (A + B)/2 and K - M = (A - B)/2.\n\nNow, let's see if we can express KL + MN in terms of A and B.\n\nKL + MN = K*L + M*N\n\nBut how to relate this to A and B? Let's see:\n\nFrom A = K + L - M + N, we can write K = A - L + M - N\n\nSimilarly, from B = -K + L + M + N, we can write K = L + M + N - B\n\nBut substituting K from one equation into another might complicate things. Let's try substituting K from A into KL + MN.\n\nIf K = A - L + M - N, then KL + MN = (A - L + M - N)L + M*N = AL - L\u00b2 + ML - NL + MN\n\nBut this seems messy. Maybe not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps find expressions for L and N in terms of A and B. Let's see:\n\nFrom A + B = 2(L + N), so L + N = (A + B)/2\n\nFrom A - B = 2(K - M), so K - M = (A - B)/2\n\nBut we also have K > L > M > N, so K is the largest, then L, then M, then N.\n\nAlternatively, maybe express KL + MN as a product. Let's see:\n\nSuppose KL + MN can be written as (something)(something else). If we can factor it, then it's composite.\n\nAlternatively, maybe KL + MN equals AB or some combination. Let's check:\n\nFrom the original equation, AB = KM + LN\n\nBut KL + MN is different. Let's see if there's a relation between KL + MN and AB.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps add KL + MN to both sides of the equation:\n\nAB + KL + MN = KM + LN + KL + MN\n\nBut not sure. Alternatively, consider that KL + MN = K(L) + M(N). Maybe relate to other terms.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that KL + MN = K*L + M*N. Let's see if we can express this in terms of the given equation.\n\nWait, let's think about the given equation again: KM + LN = AB. Maybe we can find another equation involving KL + MN.\n\nAlternatively, consider that KL + MN can be expressed as K*L + M*N. Let's see if there's a way to relate this to the given equation by manipulating variables.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that since K > L > M > N, perhaps there's a substitution that can be made. For example, let\u2019s set variables in terms of differences. Let\u2019s define a = K - L, b = L - M, c = M - N. Since all are positive integers. Then K = L + a, L = M + b, M = N + c. So K = N + c + b + a, L = N + c + b, M = N + c. But this might complicate things further. Let's try substituting.\n\nLet\u2019s set:\n\nK = N + c + b + a\n\nL = N + c + b\n\nM = N + c\n\nN = N\n\nBut this substitution might not lead us anywhere. Let's see:\n\nThen KL + MN = (N + c + b + a)(N + c + b) + (N + c)N\n\nThis seems messy. Maybe not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the original equation again. We have KM + LN = AB, and we need to relate this to KL + MN. Maybe subtract or add equations.\n\nLet me try to compute KL + MN + KM + LN = K(L + M) + N(L + M) = (K + N)(L + M)\n\nSimilarly, KL + MN - KM - LN = K(L - M) + N(M - L) = (K - N)(L - M)\n\nBut I'm not sure if this helps. Let's see:\n\nFrom the original equation, KM + LN = AB. So KL + MN = ?\n\nIf we can express KL + MN in terms of AB and other terms, maybe we can find a factorization.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that KL + MN = (K + N)(L + M) - (KM + LN). Because:\n\n(K + N)(L + M) = KL + KM + NL + NM\n\nSo, KL + MN = (K + N)(L + M) - KM - LN\n\nBut from the original equation, KM + LN = AB. Therefore:\n\nKL + MN = (K + N)(L + M) - AB\n\nSo, KL + MN = (K + N)(L + M) - AB\n\nBut we need to show that KL + MN is not prime. If we can express KL + MN as a product of two integers greater than 1, then it's composite.\n\nSo, if we can write KL + MN = (K + N)(L + M) - AB, and if (K + N)(L + M) and AB are such that their difference is a composite number, but this approach might not directly show it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps find that KL + MN is equal to a product of two terms, which would make it composite.\n\nWait, let's go back to the original equation. We have KM + LN = AB. Let's see if we can relate KL + MN to AB.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that KL + MN can be written as K*L + M*N. Let's see if there's a way to express this in terms of A and B.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that A = K + L - M + N and B = -K + L + M + N. Let's compute A*B:\n\nA*B = (K + L - M + N)(-K + L + M + N)\n\nBut we already know that this equals KM + LN. So, AB = KM + LN.\n\nBut we need to relate KL + MN to A and B. Let's see:\n\nLet me compute A + B and A - B again:\n\nA + B = 2(L + N)\n\nA - B = 2(K - M)\n\nSo, L + N = (A + B)/2\n\nK - M = (A - B)/2\n\nNow, let's try to express KL + MN in terms of A and B.\n\nKL + MN = K*L + M*N\n\nBut K = M + (K - M) = M + (A - B)/2\n\nSimilarly, L = (L + N) - N = (A + B)/2 - N\n\nBut this might not help. Alternatively, express K and M in terms of A and B.\n\nFrom K - M = (A - B)/2, so K = M + (A - B)/2\n\nSimilarly, L + N = (A + B)/2, so L = (A + B)/2 - N\n\nSubstituting these into KL + MN:\n\nKL + MN = [M + (A - B)/2] * [(A + B)/2 - N] + M*N\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that KL + MN can be expressed as (K + N)(L + M) - (KM + LN). As I did before",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to find an integer n between 0 and 1398 such that 160n is congruent to 1 modulo 1399. The problem also mentions that 35 times 40 is 1400, which is one more than 1399. Hmm, maybe that's a clue. \n\nFirst, I remember that to find a multiplicative inverse modulo m, the numbers need to be coprime. Since 1399 is a prime number? Wait, 1399... Let me check. If 1399 is prime, then every number from 1 to 1398 should have an inverse. But maybe I should confirm if 160 and 1399 are coprime. Let's compute their greatest common divisor.\n\nUsing the Euclidean algorithm. So divide 1399 by 160. Let's see: 160*8=1280, 1399-1280=119. So 1399 = 160*8 + 119. Then take 160 divided by 119. 119*1=119, 160-119=41. So 160=119*1 +41. Next, 119 divided by 41: 41*2=82, 119-82=37. So 119=41*2 +37. Then 41 divided by 37: 37*1=37, 41-37=4. So 41=37*1 +4. Next, 37 divided by 4: 4*9=36, 37-36=1. So 37=4*9 +1. Then 4 divided by 1 is 4 with remainder 0. So the GCD is 1. Therefore, 160 and 1399 are coprime, so an inverse exists.\n\nNow, to find the inverse, I need to use the extended Euclidean algorithm to express 1 as a linear combination of 160 and 1399. Let's backtrack the steps from the Euclidean algorithm.\n\nStarting from the last non-zero remainder, which is 1:\n\n1 = 37 - 4*9\n\nBut 4 was from the previous step: 4 = 41 - 37*1\n\nSubstitute that into the equation:\n\n1 = 37 - (41 - 37*1)*9 = 37 -41*9 +37*9 = 37*10 -41*9\n\nNow, 37 was from 119 -41*2. Substitute that:\n\n1 = (119 -41*2)*10 -41*9 = 119*10 -41*20 -41*9 = 119*10 -41*29\n\nThen, 41 was from 160 -119*1. Substitute:\n\n1 = 119*10 - (160 -119*1)*29 = 119*10 -160*29 +119*29 = 119*(10+29) -160*29 = 119*39 -160*29\n\nNext, 119 was from 1399 -160*8. Substitute that:\n\n1 = (1399 -160*8)*39 -160*29 = 1399*39 -160*312 -160*29 = 1399*39 -160*(312+29) = 1399*39 -160*341\n\nSo this gives 1 = 1399*39 -160*341. Therefore, rearranging, -160*341 \u2261 1 mod 1399. So the inverse of 160 is -341 mod 1399. But we need a positive integer between 0 and 1398. Let's compute -341 + 1399. 1399 -341 = 1058. So 1058 is the inverse because 160*1058 \u22611 mod 1399.\n\nWait, but the problem mentioned 35*40=1400. How does that fit in? Let me check. 1400 is 1 more than 1399, so 35*40 \u22611 mod 1399. But 35 and 40 are inverses modulo 1399. But how does that relate to 160? Maybe there's a connection here. Let's see. 160 is 40*4. Since 40 has inverse 35, then 160's inverse would be 35*4^{-1} mod 1399. Wait, but 4 inverse modulo 1399. Let's compute that. Find x such that 4x \u22611 mod 1399. Using the same method. But maybe there's a smarter way. Since 4*350=1400\u22611 mod1399. So 4*350=1400\u22611, so 4^{-1} is 350. Therefore, 160^{-1} = (40*4)^{-1} = 4^{-1}*40^{-1} = 350*35 mod1399. Let's compute 350*35. 350*35=12250. Now divide 12250 by 1399. Let's see how many times 1399 fits into 12250. 1399*8=11192. 12250-11192=1058. So 350*35=12250=1399*8 +1058. Therefore, 350*35 \u22611058 mod1399. So that's another way to get 1058 as the inverse. So both methods confirm that 1058 is the inverse. Therefore, the answer is 1058.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo find the multiplicative inverse of 160 modulo 1399, we need an integer \\( n \\) such that \\( 160n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{1399} \\). This means \\( 160n - 1 \\) must be divisible by 1399. Here's how to find \\( n \\):\n\n1. **Check Coprimality**: First, verify that 160 and 1399 are coprime (their GCD is 1). Using the Euclidean algorithm:\n   - \\( 1399 = 160 \\times 8 + 119 \\)\n   - \\( 160 = 119 \\times 1 + 41 \\)\n   - \\( 119 = 41 \\times 2 + 37 \\)\n   - \\( 41 = 37 \\times 1 + 4 \\)\n   - \\( 37 = 4 \\times 9 + 1 \\)\n   - \\( 4 = 1 \\times 4 + 0 \\)\n   \n   The GCD is 1, confirming an inverse exists.\n\n2. **Extended Euclidean Algorithm**: Backtrack the steps to express 1 as a combination of 160 and 1399:\n   - Start from \\( 1 = 37 - 4 \\times 9 \\).\n   - Substitute \\( 4 = 41 - 37 \\times 1 \\):\n     \\[\n     1 = 37 - (41 - 37) \\times 9 = 10 \\times 37 - 9 \\times 41.\n     \\]\n   - Substitute \\( 37 = 119 - 41 \\times 2 \\):\n     \\[\n     1 = 10 \\times (119 - 41 \\times 2) - 9 \\times 41 = 10 \\times 119 - 29 \\times 41.\n     \\]\n   - Substitute \\( 41 = 160 - 119 \\times 1 \\):\n     \\[\n     1 = 10 \\times 119 - 29 \\times (160 - 119) = 39 \\times 119 - 29 \\times 160.\n     \\]\n   - Substitute \\( 119 = 1399 - 160 \\times 8 \\):\n     \\[\n     1 = 39 \\times 1399 - 341 \\times 160.\n     \\]\n   \n   This shows \\( -341 \\times 160 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{1399} \\).\n\n3. **Adjust to Positive Inverse**: Since \\( -341 \\equiv 1399 - 341 = 1058 \\pmod{1399} \\), the inverse is \\( n = 1058 \\).\n\n4. **Alternative Verification Using Given Context**:\n   - The problem hints at \\( 35 \\times 40 = 1400 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{1399} \\), so \\( 40^{-1} \\equiv 35 \\pmod{1399} \\).\n   - Notice \\( 160 = 40 \\times 4 \\). Thus:\n     \\[\n     160^{-1} \\equiv (40 \\times 4)^{-1} \\equiv 40^{-1} \\times 4^{-1} \\equiv 35 \\times 4^{-1} \\pmod{1399}.\n     \\]\n   - Find \\( 4^{-1} \\): Since \\( 4 \\times 350 = 1400 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{1399} \\), \\( 4^{-1} \\equiv 350 \\).\n   - Multiply: \\( 35 \\times 350 = 12250 \\). Reduce modulo 1399:\n     \\[\n     12250 \\div 1399 = 8 \\text{ remainder } 1058 \\implies 12250 \\equiv 1058 \\pmod{1399}.\n     \\]\n   \n   Both methods confirm \\( n = 1058 \\). Thus, the multiplicative inverse of 160 modulo 1399 is **1058**.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unsolved goals\nn : ZMod 1399\nh\u2081 : n = 160\u207b\u00b9\nh_coprime : Nat.gcd 160 1399 = 1\n\u22a2 1400 = 1\ntactic 'apply' failed, failed to unify\n  @Inv.inv ?G DivInvMonoid.toInv ?a = ?b\nwith\n  @Inv.inv (ZMod 1399) (ZMod.instInv 1399) 40 = 35\nn : ZMod 1399\nh\u2081 : n = 160\u207b\u00b9\nh_coprime : Nat.gcd 160 1399 = 1\nh_inverse : 40 * 35 = 1\n\u22a2 40\u207b\u00b9 = 35\nunsolved goals\nn : ZMod 1399\nh\u2081 : n = 160\u207b\u00b9\nh_coprime : Nat.gcd 160 1399 = 1\nh_inverse : 40 * 35 = 1\nh_inverse_40 : 40\u207b\u00b9 = 35\n\u22a2 n = (4 * 40)\u207b\u00b9\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  (?a * ?b)\u207b\u00b9\nn : ZMod 1399\nh\u2081 : n = 160\u207b\u00b9\nh_coprime : Nat.gcd 160 1399 = 1\nh_inverse : 40 * 35 = 1\nh_inverse_40 : 40\u207b\u00b9 = 35\n\u22a2 (40 * 4)\u207b\u00b9 = 4\u207b\u00b9 * 40\u207b\u00b9\nunsolved goals\nn : ZMod 1399\nh\u2081 : n = 160\u207b\u00b9\nh_coprime : Nat.gcd 160 1399 = 1\nh_inverse : 40 * 35 = 1\nh_inverse_40 : 40\u207b\u00b9 = 35\n\u22a2 4\u207b\u00b9 * 35 = 1058\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unsolved goals\nn : ZMod 1399\nh\u2081 : n = 160\u207b\u00b9\nh_coprime : Nat.gcd 160 1399 = 1\n\u22a2 False\nfailed to synthesize\n  Inv \u2115\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  DivisionMonoid \u2115\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  Inv \u2115\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  Inv \u2115\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  Inv \u2115\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nunknown identifier 'inv_mul_eq_inv_mul_inv'\nunknown identifier 'this'\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, equality or iff proof expected\n  ?m.7442\ncase refine_2.refine_1\nn : ZMod 1399\nh\u2081 : n = 160\u207b\u00b9\nh_coprime : Nat.gcd 160 1399 = 1\nh_inverse : 40 * 35 = 1\nh_inverse_40 : 40\u207b\u00b9 = 35\n\u22a2 Inv \u2115\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unsolved goals\nn : ZMod 1399\nh\u2081 : n = 160\u207b\u00b9\nh_coprime : Nat.gcd 160 1399 = 1\n\u22a2 False\nfailed to synthesize\n  Inv \u2115\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  DivisionMonoid \u2115\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  Inv \u2115\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  Inv \u2115\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  Inv \u2115\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nunknown identifier 'inv_mul_eq_inv_mul_inv'\nunknown identifier 'this'\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, equality or iff proof expected\n  ?m.7442\ncase refine_2.refine_1\nn : ZMod 1399\nh\u2081 : n = 160\u207b\u00b9\nh_coprime : Nat.gcd 160 1399 = 1\nh_inverse : 40 * 35 = 1\nh_inverse_40 : 40\u207b\u00b9 = 35\n\u22a2 Inv \u2115\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve the equation \u221a(4 + \u221a(16 + 16a)) + \u221a(1 + \u221a(1 + a)) = 6 and show that a = 8 is the solution. Hmm. Alright, let's start by simplifying the equation step by step. Maybe substituting a = 8 first to check if it works, but the problem says to show that it is 8, so perhaps we need to solve for a and find that the solution is 8. Let me try to approach this systematically.\n\nFirst, let's look at the equation. There are two square root terms added together, each containing another square root. That seems a bit complicated, but maybe we can simplify each part separately. Let me denote the two terms as T1 and T2:\n\nT1 = \u221a(4 + \u221a(16 + 16a))\nT2 = \u221a(1 + \u221a(1 + a))\n\nSo the equation is T1 + T2 = 6.\n\nLet me first simplify T1. Inside T1, we have \u221a(16 + 16a). Let's factor out 16 from inside that square root:\n\n\u221a(16 + 16a) = \u221a[16(1 + a)] = 4\u221a(1 + a)\n\nSo T1 becomes \u221a(4 + 4\u221a(1 + a)) = \u221a[4(1 + \u221a(1 + a))] = 2\u221a(1 + \u221a(1 + a))\n\nWait, that's interesting. So T1 is 2 times the square root of (1 + \u221a(1 + a)), which is exactly the same structure as T2. Let me check that again.\n\nOriginal T1: \u221a(4 + \u221a(16 + 16a)) = \u221a(4 + 4\u221a(1 + a)) = \u221a[4(1 + \u221a(1 + a))] = 2\u221a(1 + \u221a(1 + a))\n\nYes, that's correct. So T1 simplifies to 2\u221a(1 + \u221a(1 + a)). Then T2 is \u221a(1 + \u221a(1 + a)). Let's denote S = \u221a(1 + \u221a(1 + a)). Then T1 = 2S and T2 = S. Wait, no. Wait, T2 is \u221a(1 + \u221a(1 + a)), which is S. But T1 is 2S. So the original equation becomes 2S + S = 3S = 6. Therefore, 3S = 6 implies S = 2. Then S = \u221a(1 + \u221a(1 + a)) = 2. Let's square both sides: 1 + \u221a(1 + a) = 4. Then \u221a(1 + a) = 3. Square again: 1 + a = 9, so a = 8. That seems straightforward. Wait, but maybe I skipped steps here. Let me verify each step carefully.\n\nStarting over:\n\nGiven equation: \u221a(4 + \u221a(16 + 16a)) + \u221a(1 + \u221a(1 + a)) = 6.\n\nFirst, simplify \u221a(16 + 16a). Factor out 16:\n\n\u221a(16(1 + a)) = 4\u221a(1 + a). So the first term becomes \u221a(4 + 4\u221a(1 + a)).\n\nFactor out 4 inside the square root:\n\n\u221a[4(1 + \u221a(1 + a))] = \u221a4 * \u221a(1 + \u221a(1 + a)) = 2\u221a(1 + \u221a(1 + a)).\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n2\u221a(1 + \u221a(1 + a)) + \u221a(1 + \u221a(1 + a)) = 6.\n\nCombine like terms. Let\u2019s let u = \u221a(1 + \u221a(1 + a)). Then the equation is 2u + u = 3u = 6. So 3u = 6 \u2192 u = 2.\n\nNow substitute back u = \u221a(1 + \u221a(1 + a)) = 2. Square both sides:\n\n1 + \u221a(1 + a) = 4 \u2192 \u221a(1 + a) = 3. Square again:\n\n1 + a = 9 \u2192 a = 8.\n\nSo that's the solution. But wait, the problem says \"Show that it is 8.\" So maybe we need to verify that a=8 satisfies the equation, and perhaps check if there are other solutions. Let me check if a=8 works.\n\nPlug a=8 into the original equation:\n\nFirst term: \u221a(4 + \u221a(16 + 16*8)) = \u221a(4 + \u221a(16 + 128)) = \u221a(4 + \u221a144) = \u221a(4 + 12) = \u221a16 = 4.\n\nSecond term: \u221a(1 + \u221a(1 + 8)) = \u221a(1 + \u221a9) = \u221a(1 + 3) = \u221a4 = 2.\n\nSo 4 + 2 = 6, which matches the equation. So a=8 works.\n\nBut wait, could there be other solutions? Let's see. Let's suppose that during the solving process, we squared both sides, which can sometimes introduce extraneous solutions. Let's check if there are other possible a's.\n\nLet me retrace the steps. We set u = \u221a(1 + \u221a(1 + a)), then found u=2. Then solved for a=8. But suppose there was another value of u that could lead to a different a. However, in this case, the equation after substitution was 3u=6, which only gives u=2. So there's only one solution here. Therefore, a=8 is the unique solution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a step where squaring could introduce other solutions. Let's check each squaring step.\n\nFirst, when we set u = \u221a(1 + \u221a(1 + a)) and found u=2. Then we squared to get 1 + \u221a(1 + a) = 4. Then \u221a(1 + a) = 3. Squaring again gives 1 + a = 9 \u2192 a=8. Each time we square, we have to check that the solution doesn't result in a negative under the square root. Let's see:\n\nIf a=8, then \u221a(1 + a) = \u221a9 = 3, which is valid. Then \u221a(1 + \u221a(1 + a)) = \u221a(1 + 3) = 2, which is valid. Then the first term becomes 2*2=4, and the second term is 2, sum to 6. All steps are valid.\n\nIf there were another solution, say a different a, but let's suppose someone tried a=0. Then:\n\nFirst term: \u221a(4 + \u221a(16 + 0)) = \u221a(4 + 4) = \u221a8 \u2248 2.828. Second term: \u221a(1 + \u221a1) = \u221a2 \u22481.414. Sum \u22484.242 \u22606. So no.\n\nAnother test: a=15. Then \u221a(1 + a)=\u221a16=4. Then \u221a(1 +4)=\u221a5\u22482.236. First term: 2*2.236\u22484.472. Second term: same as first term's inner part, \u221a5\u22482.236. Sum\u22486.708>6. So too big. So a=15 gives sum>6. So maybe a=8 is the only solution.\n\nAlternatively, let's suppose during the solving process, we might have missed something. Let's consider the original equation again. Let me try to solve it step by step without substitution.\n\nOriginal equation:\n\n\u221a(4 + \u221a(16 + 16a)) + \u221a(1 + \u221a(1 + a)) = 6.\n\nLet me denote y = \u221a(1 + a). Then \u221a(1 + a) = y \u2192 1 + a = y\u00b2 \u2192 a = y\u00b2 -1.\n\nThen the second term becomes \u221a(1 + y).\n\nThe first term's inner square root: \u221a(16 +16a) = \u221a[16(1 + a)] = 4\u221a(1 +a) =4y.\n\nSo the first term becomes \u221a(4 +4y) = \u221a[4(1 + y)] = 2\u221a(1 + y).\n\nSo the equation becomes 2\u221a(1 + y) + \u221a(1 + y) = 3\u221a(1 + y) =6 \u2192 \u221a(1 + y)=2 \u2192 1 + y=4 \u2192 y=3.\n\nSince y=\u221a(1 +a)=3 \u2192 1 +a=9 \u2192a=8. Same result. So this substitution also leads to a=8.\n\nTherefore, the solution is unique and correct. Hence, a=8 is the only solution.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo solve the equation \\(\\sqrt{4+\\sqrt{16+16a}} + \\sqrt{1+\\sqrt{1+a}} = 6\\) and show that \\(a = 8\\), we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Simplify the first radical term**:  \n   Start with \\(\\sqrt{4+\\sqrt{16+16a}}\\). Factor out 16 inside the inner square root:  \n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{16+16a} = \\sqrt{16(1+a)} = 4\\sqrt{1+a}.\n   \\]  \n   Substitute this back into the first term:  \n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{4 + 4\\sqrt{1+a}} = \\sqrt{4\\left(1 + \\sqrt{1+a}\\right)} = 2\\sqrt{1 + \\sqrt{1+a}}.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Rewrite the equation**:  \n   Let \\(u = \\sqrt{1 + \\sqrt{1+a}}\\). The equation becomes:  \n   \\[\n   2u + u = 6 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 3u = 6 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad u = 2.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\(\\sqrt{1+a}\\)**:  \n   Substitute \\(u = 2\\) back into \\(u = \\sqrt{1 + \\sqrt{1+a}}\\):  \n   \\[\n   2 = \\sqrt{1 + \\sqrt{1+a}} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 4 = 1 + \\sqrt{1+a} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\sqrt{1+a} = 3.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\(a\\)**:  \n   Square again to eliminate the remaining square root:  \n   \\[\n   1 + a = 9 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad a = 8.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Verify the solution**:  \n   Substitute \\(a = 8\\) into the original equation:  \n   - First term: \\(\\sqrt{4 + \\sqrt{16 + 16 \\cdot 8}} = \\sqrt{4 + \\sqrt{144}} = \\sqrt{4 + 12} = 4\\).  \n   - Second term: \\(\\sqrt{1 + \\sqrt{1 + 8}} = \\sqrt{1 + \\sqrt{9}} = \\sqrt{1 + 3} = 2\\).  \n   The sum is \\(4 + 2 = 6\\), confirming \\(a = 8\\) satisfies the equation.\n\n**Conclusion**: The unique solution is \\(a = 8\\). No extraneous solutions arise during the algebraic steps, as all substitutions and squaring operations preserve validity under the domain of the original equation.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unsolved goals\na : \u211d\nh\u2080 : \u221a(4 + \u221a(16 + 16 * a)) + \u221a(1 + \u221a(1 + a)) = 6\n\u22a2 \u221a(1 + \u221a(1 + a)) ^ 2 * 4 = 4 + \u221a(1 + a) * 4\ninvalid field notation, type is not of the form (C ...) where C is a constant\n  sqrt_eq_iff_sq_eq\nhas type\n  0 \u2264 ?m.4129 \u2192 0 \u2264 ?m.4130 \u2192 (\u221a?m.4129 = ?m.4130 \u2194 ?m.4130 ^ 2 = ?m.4129)\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, equality or iff proof expected\n  ?m.4132\na : \u211d\nh\u2080 : \u221a(4 + \u221a(16 + 16 * a)) + \u221a(1 + \u221a(1 + a)) = 6\n\u22a2 4 + 4 * \u221a(1 + a) = 4 + \u221a(16 + 16 * a)\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase h1.h\na : \u211d\nh\u2080 : 2 * \u221a(1 + \u221a(1 + a)) + \u221a(1 + \u221a(1 + a)) = 6\nh\u2081 : \u221a(4 + \u221a(16 + 16 * a)) = 2 * \u221a(1 + \u221a(1 + a))\nh\u2082 : 2 ^ 2 = 1 + \u221a(1 + a)\na\u271d : a < 8\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  6\na : \u211d\nh\u2080 : \u221a(4 + \u221a(16 + 16 * a)) + \u221a(1 + \u221a(1 + a)) = 6\n\u22a2 \u221a(4 + \u221a(16 + 16 * a)) = 2 * \u221a(1 + \u221a(1 + a))\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  \u221a(4 + \u221a(16 + 16 * a))\na : \u211d\nh\u2080 : \u221a(4 + \u221a(16 + 16 * a)) + \u221a(1 + \u221a(1 + a)) = 6\nh\u2081 : \u221a(4 + \u221a(16 + 16 * a)) = 2 * \u221a(1 + \u221a(1 + a))\n\u22a2 (2 * \u221a(1 + \u221a(1 + a))) ^ 2 = 4 + \u221a(16 + 16 * a)\nunsolved goals\na : \u211d\nh\u2080 : \u221a(4 + \u221a(16 + 16 * a)) + \u221a(1 + \u221a(1 + a)) = 6\nh\u2081 : \u221a(4 + \u221a(16 + 16 * a)) = 2 * \u221a(1 + \u221a(1 + a))\nh\u2082 : (2 * \u221a(1 + \u221a(1 + a))) ^ 2 = 4 + \u221a(16 + 16 * a)\n\u22a2 4 + \u221a(1 + a) * 4 = \u221a(1 + \u221a(1 + a)) ^ 2 * 4\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  \u221a(16 + 16 * a) ^ 2\na : \u211d\nh\u2080 : \u221a(4 + \u221a(16 + 16 * a)) + \u221a(1 + \u221a(1 + a)) = 6\nh\u2081 : \u221a(4 + \u221a(16 + 16 * a)) = 2 * \u221a(1 + \u221a(1 + a))\nh\u2082 : (2 * \u221a(1 + \u221a(1 + a))) ^ 2 = 4 + \u221a(16 + 16 * a)\nh\u2083 : 4 * (1 + \u221a(1 + a)) = 4 + \u221a(16 + 16 * a)\nh\u2084 : 4 * \u221a(1 + a) = \u221a(16 + 16 * a)\nh\u2085 : (4 * \u221a(1 + a)) ^ 2 = \u221a(16 + 16 * a) ^ 2\n\u22a2 16 * (1 + a) = 16 + 16 * a\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase h1.h\na : \u211d\nh\u2080 : \u221a(4 + \u221a(16 + 16 * a)) + \u221a(1 + \u221a(1 + a)) = 6\nh\u2081 : \u221a(4 + \u221a(16 + 16 * a)) = 2 * \u221a(1 + \u221a(1 + a))\nh\u2082 : (2 * \u221a(1 + \u221a(1 + a))) ^ 2 = 4 + \u221a(16 + 16 * a)\nh\u2083 : 4 * (1 + \u221a(1 + a)) = 4 + \u221a(16 + 16 * a)\nh\u2084 : 4 * \u221a(1 + a) = \u221a(16 + 16 * a)\nh\u2085 : (4 * \u221a(1 + a)) ^ 2 = \u221a(16 + 16 * a) ^ 2\nh\u2086 : 16 * (1 + a) = 16 + 16 * a\nh\u2087 : 1 + a = 1 + a\na\u271d : a < 8\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking for the sum of four floor functions applied to different multiples of N, where N is 1/3. Specifically, we need to compute \u230a10N\u230b + \u230a100N\u230b + \u230a1000N\u230b + \u230a10,000N\u230b and show that the total is 3702. \n\nFirst, let's recall what the floor function does. The floor of a number X, denoted \u230aX\u230b, is the greatest integer less than or equal to X. For example, \u230a3.5\u230b is 3 because 3 is the largest integer not exceeding 3.5. Similarly, \u230a0.99999\u230b is 0, as shown in the example provided in the context.\n\nGiven that N is 1/3, let's compute each term in the sum one by one.\n\nStarting with the first term: \u230a10N\u230b. Since N is 1/3, multiplying by 10 gives 10*(1/3) = 10/3. Let's compute that: 10 divided by 3 is approximately 3.333... So, the floor of 3.333... is 3. Therefore, \u230a10N\u230b = 3.\n\nNext term: \u230a100N\u230b. 100*(1/3) = 100/3 \u2248 33.333... The floor of 33.333... is 33. So, \u230a100N\u230b = 33.\n\nThird term: \u230a1000N\u230b. 1000*(1/3) = 1000/3 \u2248 333.333... The floor here is 333. Hence, \u230a1000N\u230b = 333.\n\nFourth term: \u230a10,000N\u230b. 10,000*(1/3) = 10,000/3 \u2248 3333.333... The floor of this is 3333. So, \u230a10,000N\u230b = 3333.\n\nNow, adding all these together: 3 + 33 + 333 + 3333. Let's compute that step by step. \n\n3 + 33 is 36. Then, 36 + 333 is 369. Finally, 369 + 3333 gives 3702. \n\nWait, but let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a calculation error. \n\nStarting with 10/3: yes, that's 3.333..., so floor is 3. 100/3 is 33.333..., floor is 33. 1000/3 is 333.333..., floor 333. 10,000/3 is 3333.333..., floor 3333. Adding them: 3 + 33 = 36, 36 + 333 = 369, 369 + 3333 = 3702. That seems correct.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a pattern here. Each term is multiplying N by a higher power of 10, which shifts the decimal but since N is 1/3, each multiplication by 10 gives a repeating 3. So each floor operation just truncates the decimal part, leaving the integer part. So each term is the integer part of 10^k * (1/3) for k from 1 to 4. \n\nFor example, 10^1*(1/3) = 3.333..., floor 3. Then 10^2*(1/3)=33.333..., floor 33. Similarly up to 10^4*(1/3)=3333.333..., floor 3333. Adding these gives 3 + 33 + 333 + 3333 = 3702. \n\nI think that's solid. The key is understanding that each time you multiply by 10, you're shifting the decimal but the fractional part remains 0.333..., so the floor just takes the integer part each time. Then adding them up gives the total sum of 3702. \n\nI don't see any mistakes here. Each step follows logically from the definition of the floor function. The example given in the context with 0.99999 having a floor of 0 reinforces that the floor function strips away the decimal part, leaving the greatest integer less than or equal to the number. Applying that to each term here gives the correct integers to sum.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo find the value of $\\lfloor 10N \\rfloor + \\lfloor 100N \\rfloor + \\lfloor 1000N \\rfloor + \\lfloor 10,\\!000N \\rfloor$ where $N = \\frac{1}{3}$, we compute each term individually using the definition of the floor function.

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to prove that if a and b are real numbers with a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 1, then ab + (a - b) \u2264 1. Hmm. Alright, first, maybe I can start by understanding what the expression ab + (a - b) represents. Let me rewrite it for clarity: ab + a - b. Maybe I can combine terms or factor something out. Let's see.\n\nSince a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 1, that reminds me of the equation of a unit circle. So a and b are points on the unit circle. Maybe trigonometric substitution could help here. Like setting a = cos\u03b8 and b = sin\u03b8. That might simplify things. Let me try that.\n\nIf I substitute a = cos\u03b8 and b = sin\u03b8, then the expression becomes cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8 + cos\u03b8 - sin\u03b8. Let's compute that. Hmm, cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8 is (1/2) sin 2\u03b8, and then cos\u03b8 - sin\u03b8. Not sure if that's immediately helpful. Maybe I can combine terms differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use algebraic manipulation. Let's consider ab + a - b. Let's see if I can factor anything here. Maybe factor a from the first two terms: a(b + 1) - b. Not sure. Alternatively, rearrange terms: ab - b + a = b(a - 1) + a. Still not obvious.\n\nWait, maybe I can complete the square or use some inequality. Since we have a constraint a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 1, perhaps using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or AM-GM inequality. Let's think. The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality says that (a\u00b7b)\u00b2 \u2264 (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2) for vectors, but maybe here it's applicable in some way.\n\nAlternatively, since a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 1, maybe I can express one variable in terms of the other. For example, solve for b in terms of a: b = \u00b1\u221a(1 - a\u00b2). Then substitute into the expression ab + a - b. But that might get messy with square roots. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, consider maximizing the expression ab + a - b under the constraint a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 1. That sounds like a Lagrange multipliers problem, but maybe there's a simpler way. Let's think of it as a function f(a, b) = ab + a - b, subject to g(a, b) = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - 1 = 0. To find its maximum, set up the Lagrangian: L = ab + a - b - \u03bb(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - 1). Take partial derivatives with respect to a, b, and \u03bb, set them to zero. But this might be a bit involved. Let's see if there's a better approach.\n\nWait, maybe I can rewrite the expression ab + a - b. Let's see: ab + a - b = a(b + 1) - b. Hmm. Alternatively, group terms differently: ab - b + a = b(a - 1) + a. Not sure. Maybe add and subtract something to complete the square.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that since a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 1, the maximum value of ab is 1/2 (since by AM-GM, ab \u2264 (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)/2 = 1/2). But then ab + (a - b) \u2264 1/2 + (a - b). But then we need to show that 1/2 + (a - b) \u2264 1, which would require (a - b) \u2264 1/2. But that's not necessarily true. For example, if a = 1 and b = 0, then a - b = 1, which is greater than 1/2. So that approach might not work.\n\nHmm. Maybe another angle. Let's consider the expression ab + a - b. Let's try to bound it. Let's write it as ab + a - b = a(b + 1) - b. Maybe factor out something. Alternatively, consider that a and b are on the unit circle, so their values are between -1 and 1. But that might not directly help.\n\nWait, perhaps using substitution. Let me set x = a - b. Then, since a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 1, maybe express x in terms of a and b. But not sure. Alternatively, let's consider variables u = a + b and v = a - b. Then a = (u + v)/2 and b = (u - v)/2. Substitute into a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 1: [(u + v)/2]^2 + [(u - v)/2]^2 = (u\u00b2 + 2uv + v\u00b2 + u\u00b2 - 2uv + v\u00b2)/4 = (2u\u00b2 + 2v\u00b2)/4 = (u\u00b2 + v\u00b2)/2 = 1. So u\u00b2 + v\u00b2 = 2. Then the expression ab + (a - b) becomes [(u + v)/2 * (u - v)/2] + v. Let's compute that: [(u\u00b2 - v\u00b2)/4] + v. So the expression is (u\u00b2 - v\u00b2)/4 + v. But since u\u00b2 + v\u00b2 = 2, we can substitute u\u00b2 = 2 - v\u00b2. Then the expression becomes (2 - v\u00b2 - v\u00b2)/4 + v = (2 - 2v\u00b2)/4 + v = (1 - v\u00b2)/2 + v. So f(v) = -v\u00b2/2 + v + 1/2. Now, this is a quadratic in v. To find its maximum, take derivative: f'(v) = -v + 1. Setting to zero gives v = 1. Then f(1) = -1/2 + 1 + 1/2 = 1. So the maximum is 1. Therefore, the expression is \u22641. That seems to work!\n\nWait, let me check this substitution again. Let me verify the steps. Starting with u = a + b and v = a - b. Then a = (u + v)/2 and b = (u - v)/2. Then a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = [(u + v)/2]^2 + [(u - v)/2]^2 = (u\u00b2 + 2uv + v\u00b2 + u\u00b2 - 2uv + v\u00b2)/4 = (2u\u00b2 + 2v\u00b2)/4 = (u\u00b2 + v\u00b2)/2 = 1. So u\u00b2 + v\u00b2 = 2. Correct.\n\nThen ab = [(u + v)/2][(u - v)/2] = (u\u00b2 - v\u00b2)/4. Then ab + (a - b) = (u\u00b2 - v\u00b2)/4 + v. Then substituting u\u00b2 = 2 - v\u00b2 gives (2 - v\u00b2 - v\u00b2)/4 + v = (2 - 2v\u00b2)/4 + v = (1 - v\u00b2)/2 + v. So f(v) = -v\u00b2/2 + v + 1/2. Taking derivative: f\u2019(v) = -v + 1. Setting to zero: v = 1. Then f(1) = -1/2 +1 +1/2 =1. Since the quadratic opens downward (coefficient of v\u00b2 is negative), the maximum is indeed 1. Therefore, the expression ab + (a - b) \u22641. That works!\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way without substitution. Let's see. Let's consider the original expression ab + a - b. Let's try to write it as ab + a - b = a(b +1) - b. Maybe use the condition a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 =1 to bound this expression. Alternatively, use Cauchy-Schwarz. Let's think.\n\nAlternatively, consider that we can write the expression as ab + a - b = a(b +1) - b. Let me try to bound this. Since a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 =1, then |a| \u22641 and |b| \u22641. So b +1 could be between 0 and 2. But not sure. Alternatively, maybe use Lagrange multipliers. Let's try that.\n\nSet up the function f(a,b) = ab + a - b, subject to g(a,b) = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 -1 =0. The Lagrangian is L = ab + a - b - \u03bb(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 -1). Take partial derivatives:\n\n\u2202L/\u2202a = b +1 - 2\u03bba =0\n\n\u2202L/\u2202b = a -1 - 2\u03bbb =0\n\n\u2202L/\u2202\u03bb = -(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 -1) =0\n\nSo we have the system:\n\n1) b +1 = 2\u03bba\n\n2) a -1 = 2\u03bbb\n\n3) a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 =1\n\nLet me solve this system. From equation 1: \u03bb = (b +1)/(2a)\n\nFrom equation 2: \u03bb = (a -1)/(2b)\n\nSet them equal: (b +1)/(2a) = (a -1)/(2b) => (b +1)/a = (a -1)/b => b(b +1) = a(a -1)\n\nExpand: b\u00b2 + b = a\u00b2 -a\n\nBut from equation 3: a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 =1 => a\u00b2 =1 - b\u00b2. Substitute into the previous equation:\n\nb\u00b2 + b = (1 - b\u00b2) -a => b\u00b2 + b =1 - b\u00b2 -a\n\nWait, but this seems a bit messy. Let's rearrange:\n\nFrom b\u00b2 + b = a\u00b2 -a, and a\u00b2 =1 - b\u00b2, substitute:\n\nb\u00b2 + b = (1 - b\u00b2) -a\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\nb\u00b2 + b -1 + b\u00b2 +a =0 => 2b\u00b2 + b +a -1=0\n\nHmm, not sure. Maybe another approach. Let's use equations 1 and 2 to express a and b in terms of \u03bb.\n\nFrom equation 1: b = 2\u03bba -1\n\nFrom equation 2: a = 2\u03bbb +1\n\nSubstitute b from equation 1 into equation 2:\n\na = 2\u03bb(2\u03bba -1) +1 =4\u03bb\u00b2a -2\u03bb +1\n\nBring terms with a to left:\n\na -4\u03bb\u00b2a = -2\u03bb +1 => a(1 -4\u03bb\u00b2) = -2\u03bb +1 => a = (-2\u03bb +1)/(1 -4\u03bb\u00b2)\n\nSimilarly, substitute a from equation 2 into equation 1:\n\nb =2\u03bba -1 =2\u03bb(2\u03bbb +1) -1 =4\u03bb\u00b2b +2\u03bb -1\n\nBring terms with b to left:\n\nb -4\u03bb\u00b2b =2\u03bb -1 => b(1 -4\u03bb\u00b2)=2\u03bb -1 => b=(2\u03bb -1)/(1 -4\u03bb\u00b2)\n\nNow, substitute a and b into the constraint a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 =1:\n\n[(-2\u03bb +1)/(1 -4\u03bb\u00b2)]\u00b2 + [(2\u03bb -1)/(1 -4\u03bb\u00b2)]\u00b2 =1\n\nLet me compute numerator:\n\nNumerator = (-2\u03bb +1)^2 + (2\u03bb -1)^2 = (4\u03bb\u00b2 -4\u03bb +1) + (4\u03bb\u00b2 -4\u03bb +1) =8\u03bb\u00b2 -8\u03bb +2\n\nDenominator = (1 -4\u03bb\u00b2)^2\n\nSo equation becomes (8\u03bb\u00b2 -8\u03bb +2)/(1 -4\u03bb\u00b2)^2 =1\n\nMultiply both sides by denominator:\n\n8\u03bb\u00b2 -8\u03bb +2 = (1 -4\u03bb\u00b2)^2\n\nExpand RHS:1 -8\u03bb\u00b2 +16\u03bb^4\n\nSo equation:8\u03bb\u00b2 -8\u03bb +2 =1 -8\u03bb\u00b2 +16\u03bb^4\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n8\u03bb\u00b2 -8\u03bb +2 -1 +8\u03bb\u00b2 -16\u03bb^4 =0 =>16\u03bb\u00b2 -8\u03bb +1 -16\u03bb^4=0\n\nRearrange: -16\u03bb^4 +16\u03bb\u00b2 -8\u03bb +1=0\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:16\u03bb^4 -16\u03bb\u00b2 +8\u03bb -1=0\n\nThis is a quartic equation, which might be difficult to solve. Maybe there's a substitution. Let me set \u03bc=\u03bb. Then 16\u03bc^4 -16\u03bc\u00b2 +8\u03bc -1=0. Not obvious. Maybe try rational roots. Possible rational roots are \u00b11, \u00b11/2, etc. Let's test \u03bc=1/2:\n\n16*(1/2)^4 -16*(1/2)^2 +8*(1/2) -1 =16*(1/16) -16*(1/4) +4 -1=1 -4 +4 -1=0. Yes! So \u03bc=1/2 is a root. Then factor out (\u03bc -1/2). Use polynomial division.\n\nDivide 16\u03bc^4 -16\u03bc\u00b2 +8\u03bc -1 by (\u03bc -1/2). Let's use synthetic division:\n\nRoot:1/2\n\nCoefficients:16, 0, -16,8,-1\n\nBring down 16\n\nMultiply by 1/2:8\n\nAdd to next term:0+8=8\n\nMultiply by1/2:4\n\nAdd to next term:-16+4=-12\n\nMultiply by1/2:-6\n\nAdd to next term:8 +(-6)=2\n\nMultiply by1/2:1\n\nAdd to last term:-1 +1=0. So the quotient is 16\u03bc^3 +8\u03bc\u00b2 -12\u03bc +2.\n\nSo the equation factors as (\u03bc -1/2)(16\u03bc^3 +8\u03bc\u00b2 -12\u03bc +2)=0.\n\nNow, let's try to factor the cubic. Let's try \u03bc=1/2 again:\n\n16*(1/2)^3 +8*(1/2)^2 -12*(1/2) +2=16*(1/8)+8*(1/4)-6+2=2+2-6+2=0. So \u03bc=1/2 is another root. Factor out (\u03bc -1/2) again.\n\nUsing synthetic division on 16\u03bc^3 +8\u03bc\u00b2 -12\u03bc +2 with root 1/2:\n\nCoefficients:16,8,-12,2\n\nBring down 16\n\nMultiply by1/2:8\n\nAdd to next term:8+8=16\n\nMultiply by1/2:8\n\nAdd to next term:-12+8=-4\n\nMultiply by1/2:-2\n\nAdd to last term:2 +(-2)=0. So quotient is16\u03bc\u00b2 +16\u03bc -4.\n\nSo now, the equation is (\u03bc -1/2)^2 (16\u03bc\u00b2 +16\u03bc -4)=0.\n\nSet 16\u03bc\u00b2 +16\u03bc -4=0. Divide by 4:4\u03bc\u00b2 +4\u03bc -1=0. Solutions: \u03bc=(-4\u00b1\u221a(16 +16))/8=(-4\u00b1\u221a32)/8=(-4\u00b14\u221a2)/8=(-1\u00b1\u221a2)/2.\n\nSo the roots are \u03bc=1/2 (double root), and \u03bc=(-1\u00b1\u221a2)/2.\n\nNow, let's find the corresponding a and b for each \u03bb.\n\nFirst, \u03bb=1/2:\n\nFrom earlier expressions:\n\na=(-2*(1/2)+1)/(1 -4*(1/2)^2)= (-1 +1)/(1 -1)=0/0. Undefined. Hmm, that's a problem. Maybe because when \u03bb=1/2, denominator 1-4\u03bb\u00b2=1-4*(1/4)=0. So division by zero. So this root is extraneous. So discard \u03bb=1/2.\n\nNext, \u03bb=(-1+\u221a2)/2:\n\nLet me compute a and b.\n\nFirst, compute \u03bb=(-1+\u221a2)/2.\n\nCompute a=(-2\u03bb +1)/(1 -4\u03bb\u00b2)\n\nSimilarly for b=(2\u03bb -1)/(1 -4\u03bb\u00b2)\n\nThis might get complicated. Let's compute denominator 1 -4\u03bb\u00b2 first.\n\n\u03bb=(-1+\u221a2)/2. Compute \u03bb\u00b2:\n\n[(-1+\u221a2)/2]^2=(1 -2\u221a2 +2)/4=(3 -2\u221a2)/4.\n\nSo 1 -4\u03bb\u00b2=1 -4*(3 -2\u221a2)/4=1 - (3 -2\u221a2)= -2 +2\u221a2=2(\u221a2 -1).\n\nSimilarly, numerator for a: -2\u03bb +1= -2*(-1+\u221a2)/2 +1= (1 -\u221a2) +1=2 -\u221a2.\n\nSo a=(2 -\u221a2)/[2(\u221a2 -1)].\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by (\u221a2 +1) to rationalize denominator:\n\n(2 -\u221a2)(\u221a2 +1)/[2( (\u221a2 -1)(\u221a2 +1))] = (2\u221a2 +2 -\u221a2*\u221a2 -\u221a2)/[2(2 -1)] = (2\u221a2 +2 -2 -\u221a2)/2*1= (\u221a2)/2.\n\nSimilarly, compute b=(2\u03bb -1)/(1 -4\u03bb\u00b2).\n\n2\u03bb -1=2*(-1+\u221a2)/2 -1= (-1+\u221a2) -1= -2 +\u221a2.\n\nSo b=(-2 +\u221a2)/[2(\u221a2 -1)].\n\nAgain, rationalize:\n\n(-2 +\u221a2)(\u221a2 +1)/[2( (\u221a2 -1)(\u221a2 +1))] = (-2\u221a2 -2 +\u221a2*\u221a2 +\u221a2)/[2*1] = (-2\u221a2 -2 +2 +\u221a2)/2= (-\u221a2)/2.\n\nSo a=\u221a2/2, b=-\u221a2/2.\n\nCheck a\u00b2 +b\u00b2=( (\u221a2/2)^2 + (\u221a2/2)^2 )= (2/4 +2/4)=1. Correct.\n\nNow compute f(a,b)=ab +a -b.\n\nab=(\u221a2/2)(-\u221a2/2)= - (2)/4= -1/2.\n\na -b= (\u221a2/2) - (-\u221a2/2)=\u221a2/2 +\u221a2/2=\u221a2.\n\nSo ab +a -b= -1/2 +\u221a2 \u2248-0.5 +1.414\u22480.914 <1. Wait, but we need to check if this is the maximum. Wait, but earlier substitution suggested the maximum is 1. Hmm. Maybe there's a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, let's check the other root \u03bb=(-1 -\u221a2)/2. But that would give a negative value, perhaps",

So, we have a function f defined on positive rational numbers, and it has two key properties: first, it's additive over multiplication, meaning f(a\u00b7b) = f(a) + f(b) for any positive rationals a and b. Second, for every prime number p, f(p) = p. We need to determine for which of the given options x, the value f(x) is less than 0. The answer is supposed to be option E, which is 25/11, but we need to show why.\n\nFirst, let's recall that positive rational numbers can be expressed as products of primes raised to integer exponents. For example, any rational number can be written as a fraction a/b where a and b are integers, and then both a and b can be factored into primes. Since the function f is defined on positive rationals, we can consider x in its prime factorization form. But since x is a positive rational, it can be written as a product of primes raised to positive or negative integers (since denominators are primes with negative exponents).\n\nGiven the property f(a\u00b7b) = f(a) + f(b), this is reminiscent of logarithms, where log(ab) = log a + log b. However, in this case, the function f isn't a logarithm because when applied to primes, it returns the prime itself, not its logarithm. So, we need to model f based on these properties.\n\nLet's consider how f acts on a general rational number. Suppose x is a positive rational number. Then x can be written as a product of primes raised to integer exponents. Let's write x as:\n\nx = p\u2081^{k\u2081} \u00b7 p\u2082^{k\u2082} \u00b7 ... \u00b7 p\u2099^{k\u2099}\n\nwhere each p_i is a prime and each k_i is an integer (positive or negative). Then, applying the function f to x, using the additive property over multiplication, we get:\n\nf(x) = f(p\u2081^{k\u2081}) + f(p\u2082^{k\u2082}) + ... + f(p\u2099^{k\u2099})\n\nBut since f(a\u00b7b) = f(a) + f(b), then for exponents, we can generalize that f(p^k) = k\u00b7f(p). Because, for example, f(p^2) = f(p\u00b7p) = f(p) + f(p) = 2f(p), and similarly for any integer k, positive or negative. Wait, but the problem states that for primes p, f(p) = p. So, if we have a prime p raised to the power k, then f(p^k) = k\u00b7f(p) = k\u00b7p.\n\nTherefore, for any x expressed as a product of primes with exponents, f(x) would be the sum over each prime's exponent multiplied by the prime itself. So, if x = product_{p} p^{k_p}, then f(x) = sum_{p} k_p \u00b7 p.\n\nSo, the function f is additive over multiplication, and for primes, it's linear in their exponents. Therefore, to compute f(x) for any x, we need to factor x into primes, take the exponents, multiply each exponent by the corresponding prime, and sum them all up. Then, if that sum is negative, f(x) < 0.\n\nNow, let's apply this to each of the options given. We need to factor each fraction into primes, note the exponents, compute the sum of (exponent \u00d7 prime) for each prime, and check which one is negative.\n\nLet's go through each option:\n\nA) 17/32\n\nFirst, factor numerator and denominator:\n\n17 is prime, so numerator is 17^1.\n\nDenominator 32 is 2^5.\n\nSo, 17/32 = 17^1 \u00d7 2^{-5}.\n\nTherefore, exponents:\n\nFor prime 17: exponent +1, so term is 1\u00d717 = 17.\n\nFor prime 2: exponent -5, so term is (-5)\u00d72 = -10.\n\nTotal f(17/32) = 17 + (-10) = 7. Which is positive. So A is not the answer.\n\nB) 11/16\n\nNumerator 11 is prime, exponent +1.\n\nDenominator 16 is 2^4, exponent -4.\n\nSo f(11/16) = 1\u00d711 + (-4)\u00d72 = 11 - 8 = 3. Positive. Not B.\n\nC) 7/9\n\nNumerator 7 is prime, exponent +1.\n\nDenominator 9 is 3^2, exponent -2.\n\nSo f(7/9) = 1\u00d77 + (-2)\u00d73 = 7 - 6 = 1. Positive. Not C.\n\nD) 7/6\n\nNumerator 7 is prime, exponent +1.\n\nDenominator 6 is 2\u00d73, so exponents -1 for both 2 and 3.\n\nThus, f(7/6) = 1\u00d77 + (-1)\u00d72 + (-1)\u00d73 = 7 - 2 -3 = 2. Positive. Not D.\n\nE) 25/11\n\nNumerator 25 is 5^2, exponent +2.\n\nDenominator 11 is prime, exponent -1.\n\nSo f(25/11) = 2\u00d75 + (-1)\u00d711 = 10 -11 = -1. Negative. Therefore, E is the answer.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each calculation to be sure.\n\nFor A: 17/32. Prime factors: 17^1 and 2^-5. So f(x) = 1*17 + (-5)*2 = 17 -10 =7. Correct.\n\nB:11/16. 11^1 and 2^-4. So 11*1 + (-4)*2=11-8=3. Correct.\n\nC:7/9. 7^1 and 3^-2. So 7*1 + (-2)*3=7-6=1. Correct.\n\nD:7/6. 7^1, 2^-1, 3^-1. So 7*1 + (-1)*2 + (-1)*3=7-2-3=2. Correct.\n\nE:25/11. 5^2 and 11^-1. So 2*5 + (-1)*11=10-11=-1. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the only x where f(x) is negative is E, 25/11.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo determine which number \\( x \\) results in \\( f(x) < 0 \\), we analyze the function \\( f \\) using its given properties.

For example, \\( \\frac{a}{b} = \\prod p_i^{k_i} \\), where \\( k_i \\) are integers. By the additive property, \\( f(x) \\) becomes the sum of \\( k_i \\cdot p_i \\) for each prime \\( p_i \\).

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking where the lines 3y = x and 2x + 5y = 11 intersect, specifically at point A, and then to show that the sum of the coordinates (x + y) of point A is 4. \n\nFirst, I need to find the point of intersection of the two lines. To do that, I can solve the system of equations given by the two lines. The first equation is 3y = x, which I can rewrite as x = 3y. That seems straightforward. The second equation is 2x + 5y = 11. Since I already have x expressed in terms of y from the first equation, maybe substitution would be the best method here.\n\nSo substituting x = 3y into the second equation. Let's do that. Replace x in the second equation with 3y. That gives 2*(3y) + 5y = 11. Let's compute that: 6y + 5y = 11. Combining like terms gives 11y = 11. Then dividing both sides by 11, we get y = 1. \n\nOnce we have y = 1, plug that back into the first equation to find x. Since x = 3y, substituting y = 1 gives x = 3*1 = 3. So the coordinates of point A should be (3, 1). \n\nNow, the sum of the coordinates would be x + y = 3 + 1 = 4. That matches what the problem is asking to show. \n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure there's no mistake. Let's verify the solution in both original equations. \n\nFirst equation: 3y = x. Plugging in x=3 and y=1: 3*1 = 3, which is correct. \n\nSecond equation: 2x + 5y = 11. Plugging in x=3 and y=1: 2*3 + 5*1 = 6 + 5 = 11, which also checks out. \n\nSo both equations are satisfied by (3,1), so that's definitely the intersection point. Therefore, the sum of the coordinates is indeed 4. \n\nHmm, but wait, the context provided earlier was about an inconsistent system leading to a contradiction. But in this problem, the system seems consistent. Maybe the context was a different example. Anyway, in this case, substitution worked smoothly without any inconsistencies. So the answer is 4.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo find the intersection point \\( A \\) of the lines \\( 3y = x \\) and \\( 2x + 5y = 11 \\), we solve the system of equations. \n\nFirst, observe that \\( 3y = x \\) allows us to express \\( x \\) in terms of \\( y \\):  \n\\[ x = 3y. \\]  \nSubstitute \\( x = 3y \\) into the second equation \\( 2x + 5y = 11 \\):  \n\\[ 2(3y) + 5y = 11. \\]  \nSimplifying:  \n\\[ 6y + 5y = 11 \\implies 11y = 11 \\implies y = 1. \\]  \n\nNow substitute \\( y = 1 \\) back into \\( x = 3y \\):  \n\\[ x = 3(1) = 3. \\]  \n\nThus, the coordinates of \\( A \\) are \\( (3, 1) \\).

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to show that if p is a prime number and a is a positive integer, then p divides a^p - a. Hmm, this reminds me of something I've heard before, maybe Fermat's Little Theorem? Let me think.\n\nFermat's Little Theorem states that if p is a prime and a is an integer not divisible by p, then a^(p-1) \u2261 1 mod p. So multiplying both sides by a gives a^p \u2261 a mod p, which means p divides a^p - a. But wait, what if a is divisible by p? If p divides a, then a \u2261 0 mod p, so a^p would also be 0 mod p, and a^p - a would be 0 - 0 = 0 mod p. So in both cases, whether a is divisible by p or not, p divides a^p - a. That seems to cover all possibilities. \n\nBut maybe I should break it down more carefully. Let's consider two cases: when p divides a and when it doesn't. \n\nCase 1: p divides a. Then a = kp for some integer k. Then a^p = (kp)^p = k^p p^p. So a^p - a = k^p p^p - kp = kp(p^{p-1}k^{p-1} - 1). Since p is a factor here, clearly p divides this expression. \n\nCase 2: p does not divide a. Then by Fermat's Little Theorem, a^{p-1} \u2261 1 mod p. Multiply both sides by a to get a^p \u2261 a mod p, which implies a^p - a is divisible by p. \n\nSo combining both cases, whether p divides a or not, p divides a^p - a. That should do it. Wait, but maybe I need to reference the theorem from the context given. The context had something about p dividing a^n implying p^n divides a^n. But here, the problem is different. However, maybe there's a connection. Let me check the context again.\n\nThe context's theorem was that p divides a^n if and only if p^n divides a^n. The proof used Euclid's Lemma for the necessary condition. But how does that relate to the current problem? Maybe not directly, but perhaps the idea of using Euclid's Lemma or properties of primes in divisibility is relevant here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe induction could work. Let's see. For a fixed prime p, can we prove this for all a by induction? Base case: a=1. Then 1^p -1 = 0, which is divisible by p. Assume it's true for a=k, so p divides k^p -k. Now consider a=k+1. Expand (k+1)^p using the binomial theorem. The expansion is k^p + C(p,1)k^{p-1} + ... + C(p,p-1)k + 1. Then (k+1)^p - (k+1) = k^p -k + [C(p,1)k^{p-1} + ... + C(p,p-1)k]. Each term C(p,i) for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 p-1 is divisible by p because p is prime and those binomial coefficients are multiples of p. So the entire expression is divisible by p by the induction hypothesis and the fact that each middle term is divisible by p. Hence, by induction, it holds for all positive integers a. \n\nBut maybe that's more complicated than needed. The initial approach using Fermat's Little Theorem seems straightforward. However, I should verify if Fermat's Little Theorem is applicable here. The problem states a is a positive integer, and p is prime. If a and p are coprime, then FLT applies. If not, then p divides a, so a \u2261 0 mod p, and a^p \u2261 0 \u2261 a mod p. So in both cases, a^p \u2261 a mod p, hence p divides a^p -a. \n\nTherefore, the proof can be structured by splitting into two cases based on whether p divides a or not, applying FLT when they are coprime, and directly showing divisibility when p divides a. That should cover all possibilities and complete the proof.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo show that a prime number \\( p \\) divides \\( a^p - a \\) for any positive integer \\( a \\), we analyze two cases based on whether \\( p \\) divides \\( a \\) or not.\n\n**Case 1: \\( p \\) divides \\( a \\).**  \nIf \\( p \\) divides \\( a \\), then \\( a \\equiv 0 \\mod p \\). Raising both sides to the power \\( p \\), we get \\( a^p \\equiv 0^p \\equiv 0 \\mod p \\). Subtracting \\( a \\) from both sides gives \\( a^p - a \\equiv 0 - 0 \\equiv 0 \\mod p \\). Thus, \\( p \\) divides \\( a^p - a \\).\n\n**Case 2: \\( p \\) does not divide \\( a \\).**  \nHere, \\( a \\) and \\( p \\) are coprime. By **Fermat's Little Theorem**, since \\( p \\) is prime and \\( a \\) is not divisible by \\( p \\), we know:\n\\[\na^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\mod p.\n\\]\nMultiplying both sides by \\( a \\), we obtain:\n\\[\na^p \\equiv a \\mod p.\n\\]\nRearranging this gives \\( a^p - a \\equiv 0 \\mod p \\), meaning \\( p \\) divides \\( a^p - a \\).\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nIn both cases, whether \\( p \\) divides \\( a \\) or not, \\( p \\) divides \\( a^p - a \\).

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is to find which of the given options is equivalent to the product (2+3)(2\u00b2+3\u00b2)(2\u2074+3\u2074)... up to (2\u2076\u2074+3\u2076\u2074). The options involve expressions with exponents like 3\u00b9\u00b2\u2078 - 2\u00b9\u00b2\u2078. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you have products of terms like (a + b), especially when each subsequent term is a power of the previous, there might be a telescoping product or a formula that simplifies this. Maybe something related to the difference of squares? Because usually, (a + b)(a - b) = a\u00b2 - b\u00b2. But here, all the factors are sums, not differences. Wait, but maybe there's a pattern where each multiplication builds up to a higher power difference.\n\nLet me think. Let's start with a simpler case. Suppose we have just two terms: (2 + 3)(2\u00b2 + 3\u00b2). Let's compute that. (2+3)=5. Then (5)(2\u00b2 + 3\u00b2) = 5*(4 + 9) = 5*13 = 65. Now, 3\u2074 - 2\u2074 is 81 - 16 = 65. Oh! So (2+3)(2\u00b2+3\u00b2) = 3\u2074 - 2\u2074. Interesting. That seems like a pattern. So maybe each time we multiply by the next term, we're building up the exponent in a difference of powers.\n\nLet me check with another term. Let's take the next one: (2+3)(2\u00b2+3\u00b2)(2\u2074+3\u2074). From the previous step, we had 3\u2074 - 2\u2074. Then multiply that by (2\u2074 + 3\u2074). So (3\u2074 - 2\u2074)(3\u2074 + 2\u2074) = (3\u2074)\u00b2 - (2\u2074)\u00b2 = 3\u2078 - 2\u2078. So that's the next step. So each multiplication by (2^{2^k} + 3^{2^k}) takes the previous difference (3^{2^{k}} - 2^{2^{k}}) and multiplies it by (2^{2^k} + 3^{2^k}), resulting in 3^{2^{k+1}}} - 2^{2^{k+1}}}.\n\nSo if we follow this pattern, each step doubles the exponent in the difference. Let's see:\n\nStart with (2 + 3) = 5. Then:\n\nFirst product: (2 + 3)(2\u00b2 + 3\u00b2) = 3\u2074 - 2\u2074.\n\nSecond product: (3\u2074 - 2\u2074)(2\u2074 + 3\u2074) = 3\u2078 - 2\u2078.\n\nThird product: (3\u2078 - 2\u2078)(2\u2078 + 3\u2078) = 3\u00b9\u2076 - 2\u00b9\u2076.\n\nContinuing this way, each multiplication by (2^{2^k} + 3^{2^k}) gives us the next difference. The original product has factors up to (2\u2076\u2074 + 3\u2076\u2074). Let's count how many terms there are. The exponents are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64. That's 7 terms. Starting from exponent 1 (2^1 + 3^1) up to 2^6 (since 2^6=64). So each step doubles the exponent in the difference. Let's track the exponents:\n\nAfter first term (2+3): exponent 2^1, so 3^2 - 2^2? Wait, no. Wait, when we did (2+3)(2\u00b2+3\u00b2), we got 3^4 - 2^4. Wait, maybe the exponent after k terms is 2^{k+1}? Let me check:\n\nFirst term: (2+3) = 5. If we consider that as the first step, then the next step after multiplying by (2\u00b2+3\u00b2) gives 3^4 - 2^4. Then multiplying by (2^4 +3^4) gives 3^8 -2^8. So each time, the exponent doubles. So starting with exponent 1 (since 2+3 is 2^1 +3^1), then each multiplication doubles the exponent in the difference. So after 7 terms, the exponent would be 2^7 = 128. Therefore, the entire product would be 3^128 - 2^128. That matches option C.\n\nBut let me verify this step-by-step to be sure. Let's take the first few terms:\n\nTerm 1: (2 + 3) = 5. If we think of this as (3 + 2), then if we consider the formula (a - b)(a + b) = a\u00b2 - b\u00b2. But here, we have (a + b) only. Wait, but how does the first step lead to 3^4 - 2^4?\n\nWait, maybe the first multiplication is (2 + 3)(2\u00b2 + 3\u00b2). Let's compute that:\n\n(2 + 3) = 5.\n\n(2\u00b2 + 3\u00b2) = 4 + 9 = 13.\n\nMultiply them: 5 * 13 = 65.\n\nNow, 3^4 = 81, 2^4 = 16. 81 - 16 = 65. So indeed, (2+3)(2\u00b2+3\u00b2) = 3^4 - 2^4.\n\nThen, multiplying by (2^4 +3^4):\n\n(3^4 - 2^4)(3^4 + 2^4) = (3^4)^2 - (2^4)^2 = 3^8 - 2^8.\n\nThen multiply by (2^8 +3^8):\n\n(3^8 -2^8)(3^8 +2^8) = 3^16 -2^16.\n\nContinuing this pattern, each multiplication by (2^{2^k} +3^{2^k}) gives the next difference. So after multiplying all seven terms, the result is 3^{128} -2^{128}, since 2^7 = 128. Therefore, the answer is option C.\n\nI need to make sure there are exactly seven terms. Let's list them:\n\n(2^1 +3^1), (2^2 +3^2), (2^4 +3^4), (2^8 +3^8), (2^16 +3^16), (2^32 +3^32), (2^64 +3^64). Yes, that's seven terms. Each term's exponent is double the previous. Starting at 1, then 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64. Each time, the exponent is 2^k where k starts at 0: 2^0=1, 2^1=2, up to 2^6=64. So seven terms. Therefore, after seven multiplications, the exponent becomes 2^(7+1) = 2^8? Wait, no. Wait, the exponents in the difference after each step:\n\nAfter first multiplication (two terms): 3^4 -2^4 (which is 2^2 exponent). Wait, maybe the exponent after n terms is 2^{n+1}? Let's see:\n\nFirst term (n=1): (2+3) = 5. But according to the first step, after multiplying two terms (n=2?), the exponent is 4. Wait, maybe the number of terms is 7, so exponents go up as 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128? Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, each multiplication step corresponds to doubling the exponent in the difference. Starting with (2+3) = 5. Then multiplying by (2\u00b2+3\u00b2) gives 3^4 -2^4. Then multiplying by (2^4 +3^4) gives 3^8 -2^8. Each time, the exponent doubles. So after k multiplications, the exponent is 2^{k+1}. Wait, but the first multiplication (after the first term) would be k=1, exponent 4=2^2. Then k=2, exponent 8=2^3. So after k multiplications, exponent is 2^{k+1}. Since there are 7 terms, that would be 6 multiplications after the first term? Wait, no. Wait, the product is (2+3)(2\u00b2+3\u00b2)...(2^64+3^64). That's 7 terms. Each term after the first is a multiplication that doubles the exponent. Wait, maybe the number of terms is 7, so the exponent is 2^{7}? Wait, 2^7=128. Yes. Because each term adds a factor that doubles the exponent in the difference. So starting with (2+3) which is part of the formula, then each subsequent term doubles the exponent. So after 7 terms, the exponent is 2^7=128. Therefore, the product is 3^{128} -2^{128}, which is option C.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nLet's analyze the given product step by step. The expression is a product of terms of the form \\( (2^{2^k} + 3^{2^k}) \\) for \\( k = 0, 1, 2, \\dots, 6 \\), resulting in seven factors:  \n\\[\n(2+3)(2^2+3^2)(2^4+3^4)(2^8+3^8)(2^{16}+3^{16})(2^{32}+3^{32})(2^{64}+3^{64}).\n\\]\n\n**Key Observation**:  \nEach term \\( (2^{2^k} + 3^{2^k}) \\) resembles the structure of a sum that, when multiplied by a difference, creates a telescoping pattern. Specifically, the product of a difference and a sum can simplify via the identity:  \n\\[\n(a - b)(a + b) = a^2 - b^2.\n\\]\nHere, however, all factors are sums, not differences. To resolve this, notice that the product can be reinterpreted recursively as a difference of powers.\n\n**Step-by-Step Simplification**:  \n1. **First two terms**:  \n   \\[\n   (2 + 3)(2^2 + 3^2) = 5 \\cdot 13 = 65.\n   \\]\n   Observe that \\( 3^4 - 2^4 = 81 - 16 = 65 \\). Thus,  \n   \\[\n   (2 + 3)(2^2 + 3^2) = 3^4 - 2^4.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Multiply by \\( (2^4 + 3^4) \\)**:  \n   \\[\n   (3^4 - 2^4)(2^4 + 3^4) = (3^4)^2 - (2^4)^2 = 3^8 - 2^8.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply by \\( (2^8 + 3^8) \\)**:  \n   \\[\n   (3^8 - 2^8)(2^8 + 3^8) = 3^{16} - 2^{16}.\n   \\]\n\nContinuing this pattern, each multiplication by \\( (2^{2^k} + 3^{2^k}) \\) doubles the exponent in the resulting difference. After repeating this process for all seven terms, the final exponent becomes \\( 2^7 = 128 \\). Thus, the entire product simplifies to:  \n\\[\n3^{128} - 2^{128}.\n\\]\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nThe telescoping nature of the product reduces it to the difference \\( 3^{128} - 2^{128} \\), which matches option **(C)**. This pattern holds because each multiplication step leverages the difference-of-squares identity recursively, doubling the exponent at each stage.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unsolved goals\nk : \u2115\n\u22a2 170141183460469231731687303715884105728 + 3 ^ 2 ^ k = 11790184577738583171520532579045597727214748217668409340885505\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the sum of the even-numbered terms in an arithmetic progression where the common difference is 1, and the total sum of the first 98 terms is 137. The answer is supposed to be 093, but I need to show how that works.\n\nFirst, let's recall what an arithmetic progression (AP) is. In an AP, each term after the first is obtained by adding a constant difference. Here, the common difference is 1, so the sequence goes a\u2081, a\u2081 + 1, a\u2081 + 2, and so on. So, the nth term a\u2099 is a\u2081 + (n-1)*1 = a\u2081 + n - 1.\n\nThe problem asks for the sum of the even-numbered terms up to the 98th term. That would be a\u2082 + a\u2084 + a\u2086 + ... + a\u2089\u2088. Since 98 is even, there are 49 terms in this sum (because 98 divided by 2 is 49).\n\nNow, the total sum of the first 98 terms is given as 137. Let's denote that sum as S = a\u2081 + a\u2082 + ... + a\u2089\u2088 = 137. We need to find the sum of the even terms, let's call that S_even, and show that it's 093 (which I assume is 93, maybe a typo with leading zero).\n\nLet me think about how to relate S and S_even. Since the sequence is arithmetic with difference 1, the even terms form their own arithmetic sequence. Let's see:\n\nThe first even term is a\u2082 = a\u2081 + 1 (since a\u2081 is the first term, a\u2082 = a\u2081 + 1*1). The next even term is a\u2084 = a\u2081 + 3, then a\u2086 = a\u2081 + 5, and so on, up to a\u2089\u2088 = a\u2081 + 97. So the even terms are a\u2081 + 1, a\u2081 + 3, ..., a\u2081 + 97. This is also an arithmetic sequence with first term a\u2081 + 1 and common difference 2 (since each even term increases by 2 in the original sequence).\n\nThe number of terms in S_even is 49, as mentioned. The sum of an arithmetic sequence is (number of terms)/2 * (first term + last term). So S_even = 49/2 * [(a\u2081 + 1) + (a\u2081 + 97)] = 49/2 * (2a\u2081 + 98) = 49*(a\u2081 + 49).\n\nNow, the total sum S = 137 is the sum of the first 98 terms of the original AP. The sum of the first n terms of an AP is n/2 * [2a\u2081 + (n-1)d]. Here, n=98, d=1. So S = 98/2 * [2a\u2081 + 97*1] = 49*(2a\u2081 + 97) = 137.\n\nSo 49*(2a\u2081 + 97) = 137. Let's solve for a\u2081. Divide both sides by 49: 2a\u2081 + 97 = 137/49. Wait, 137 divided by 49 is approximately 2.7959... That seems odd because 2a\u2081 + 97 should be an integer if a\u2081 is an integer. But maybe a\u2081 isn't an integer. Hmm, but the problem states that the common difference is 1, which is an integer. So perhaps a\u2081 is a non-integer. Let's proceed.\n\nSo 2a\u2081 + 97 = 137/49. Then 2a\u2081 = 137/49 - 97. Let's compute 137/49 - 97. 137 divided by 49 is approximately 2.7959. 2.7959 - 97 = -94.2041. So 2a\u2081 \u2248 -94.2041, so a\u2081 \u2248 -47.10205. That seems messy. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, the problem says to show that the sum of the even terms is 093. If that's 93, then maybe there's a different approach. Let's check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a relationship between the sum of all terms and the sum of even terms. Let's think about the original sum S = sum_{k=1}^{98} a_k = 137. The sum of the even terms S_even = sum_{k=1}^{49} a_{2k} = sum_{k=1}^{49} (a\u2081 + (2k -1)) = sum_{k=1}^{49} (a\u2081 + 2k -1) = 49a\u2081 + 2 sum_{k=1}^{49} k - sum_{k=1}^{49} 1 = 49a\u2081 + 2*(49*50)/2 - 49 = 49a\u2081 + 49*50 -49 = 49a\u2081 + 49*(50-1) = 49a\u2081 + 49*49 = 49(a\u2081 + 49).\n\nSimilarly, the sum of the odd terms S_odd = sum_{k=1}^{49} a_{2k-1} = sum_{k=1}^{49} (a\u2081 + (2k-2)) = sum_{k=1}^{49} (a\u2081 + 2k -2) = 49a\u2081 + 2 sum_{k=1}^{49} k - 2*49 = 49a\u2081 + 2*(49*50)/2 - 98 = 49a\u2081 + 49*50 -98 = 49a\u2081 + 2450 -98 = 49a\u2081 + 2352.\n\nBut S = S_odd + S_even = (49a\u2081 + 2352) + (49a\u2081 + 49*49) = 98a\u2081 + 2352 + 2401 = 98a\u2081 + 4753. But we know S = 137, so 98a\u2081 + 4753 = 137. Then 98a\u2081 = 137 - 4753 = -4616. So a\u2081 = -4616/98 = -2308/49 \u2248 -47.102. This matches the previous result. But then S_even = 49(a\u2081 +49) = 49*(-2308/49 +49) = 49*(-2308 + 49*49)/49 = (-2308 + 2401) = 93. Ah! So S_even = 93, which matches the desired 093 (assuming leading zero is a typo). So even though a\u2081 is a fraction, the sum S_even ends up being an integer, 93.\n\nSo the key steps are:\n\n1. Express S_even in terms of a\u2081.\n2. Express S (total sum) in terms of a\u2081.\n3. Solve for a\u2081 from S = 137.\n4. Substitute a\u2081 back into S_even to get 93.\n\nAlternatively, there might be a smarter way to relate S and S_even without solving for a\u2081 explicitly. Let's see.\n\nWe have S = sum_{k=1}^{98} a_k = 137.\n\nS_even = sum_{k=1}^{49} a_{2k} = sum_{k=1}^{49} (a\u2081 + (2k -1)).\n\nSimilarly, S_odd = sum_{k=1}^{49} a_{2k-1} = sum_{k=1}^{49} (a\u2081 + (2k -2)).\n\nThen S = S_odd + S_even = sum_{k=1}^{49} [a\u2081 + (2k -2)] + sum_{k=1}^{49} [a\u2081 + (2k -1)] = sum_{k=1}^{49} [2a\u2081 + 4k -3].\n\nBut maybe that's complicating things. The previous approach worked, even though a\u2081 is not an integer. The final sum S_even ends up being 93, which is the answer.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo find the sum of the even-numbered terms \\( a_2 + a_4 + a_6 + \\ldots + a_{98} \\) in an arithmetic progression (AP) with common difference 1 and total sum \\( S = a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_{98} = 137 \\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the AP Structure**:\n   - The nth term of the AP is \\( a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \\cdot 1 = a_1 + n - 1 \\).\n   - The even terms form their own AP: \\( a_2 = a_1 + 1 \\), \\( a_4 = a_1 + 3 \\), ..., \\( a_{98} = a_1 + 97 \\).\n\n2. **Express the Sum of Even Terms**:\n   - There are 49 even terms (since \\( 98/2 = 49 \\)).\n   - The sum \\( S_{\\text{even}} = \\sum_{k=1}^{49} (a_1 + (2k - 1)) \\).\n   - Simplify: \\( S_{\\text{even}} = 49a_1 + \\sum_{k=1}^{49} (2k - 1) \\).\n   - Compute the summation: \\( \\sum_{k=1}^{49} (2k - 1) = 2 \\sum_{k=1}^{49} k - \\sum_{k=1}^{49} 1 = 2 \\cdot \\frac{49 \\cdot 50}{2} - 49 = 49 \\cdot 50 - 49 = 49 \\cdot 49 = 2401 \\).\n   - Thus, \\( S_{\\text{even}} = 49a_1 + 2401 \\).\n\n3. **Express the Total Sum**:\n   - The total sum \\( S = \\sum_{k=1}^{98} a_k = \\frac{98}{2} [2a_1 + 97 \\cdot 1] = 49(2a_1 + 97) \\).\n   - Given \\( S = 137 \\), solve for \\( a_1 \\):\n     \\[\n     49(2a_1 + 97) = 137 \\implies 2a_1 + 97 = \\frac{137}{49} \\implies 2a_1 = \\frac{137}{49} - 97 \\implies a_1 = \\frac{137 - 97 \\cdot 49}{98} = \\frac{137 - 4753}{98} = \\frac{-4616}{98} = -\\frac{2308}{49}.\n     \\]\n\n4. **Substitute \\( a_1 \\) Back into \\( S_{\\text{even}} \\)**:\n   - \\( S_{\\text{even}} = 49 \\left( -\\frac{2308}{49} + 49 \\right) = 49 \\left( -\\frac{2308}{49} + \\frac{2401}{49} \\right) = 49 \\cdot \\frac{93}{49} = 93 \\).\n\n**Conclusion**: The sum of the even-numbered terms \\( a_2 + a_4 + \\ldots + a_{98} \\) is **93**.\nPrevious attempt failed with: invalid field 'succ', the environment does not contain 'Rat.succ'\n  k\nhas type\n  \u211a\ninvalid alternative name 'zero'\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: invalid field notation, type is not of the form (C ...) where C is a constant\n  k\nhas type\n  ?m.314\ninvalid field notation, type is not of the form (C ...) where C is a constant\n  k\nhas type\n  ?m.314\nunsolved goals\nu : \u2115 \u2192 \u211a\nh\u2080 : \u2200 (n : \u2115), u (n + 1) = u n + 1\nh\u2081 : \u2211 k \u2208 Finset.range 98, u k.succ = 137\n\u22a2 \u2211 k \u2208 Finset.range 49, u (2 * k.succ) = 93\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unexpected identifier; expected command\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The roots of the polynomial P(x) = x\u00b3 + a x\u00b2 + b x + c are given as cos(2\u03c0/7), cos(4\u03c0/7), and cos(6\u03c0/7). We need to find the product abc and show it's 1/32. Hmm, the answer choices suggest it's a fraction, so maybe we need to use trigonometric identities or properties of cubic equations with cosine roots.\n\nFirst, since the roots are cosines of angles that are multiples of 2\u03c0/7, maybe there's a connection to Chebyshev polynomials or some specific trigonometric identities. Alternatively, since the polynomial is cubic with these roots, we can use Vieta's formulas to relate the coefficients a, b, c to the sums and products of the roots.\n\nVieta's formulas for a cubic x\u00b3 + a x\u00b2 + b x + c = 0 tell us that:\n- The sum of the roots is -a.\n- The sum of products of roots two at a time is b.\n- The product of the roots is -c.\n\nSo, let's compute these sums and products using the given roots.\n\nFirst, let's compute a = -(sum of roots). The roots are cos(2\u03c0/7), cos(4\u03c0/7), cos(6\u03c0/7). So sum = cos(2\u03c0/7) + cos(4\u03c0/7) + cos(6\u03c0/7). I remember that there's a formula for the sum of cosines of angles in arithmetic progression. Alternatively, maybe there's a known identity for these specific angles related to 7th roots of unity.\n\nWait, 2\u03c0/7, 4\u03c0/7, 6\u03c0/7 are angles that are double those of the 7th roots of unity. Let me recall that the sum of cos(2\u03c0k/7) for k=1 to 6 is equal to -1/2, since the real parts of the 7th roots of unity sum to zero. But here, we have cos(2\u03c0/7), cos(4\u03c0/7), cos(6\u03c0/7), and also cos(8\u03c0/7), cos(10\u03c0/7), cos(12\u03c0/7) if we go beyond \u03c0. But since cos(\u03b8) = cos(2\u03c0 - \u03b8), cos(8\u03c0/7) = cos(6\u03c0/7), but wait, 8\u03c0/7 is more than \u03c0, so cos(8\u03c0/7) = cos(8\u03c0/7 - 2\u03c0) = cos(-6\u03c0/7) = cos(6\u03c0/7). Wait, maybe I'm complicating this.\n\nAlternatively, the sum of cos(2\u03c0k/7) for k=1 to 3 (i.e., 2\u03c0/7, 4\u03c0/7, 6\u03c0/7) is known. Let me check. There's a formula that the sum of cos(2\u03c0k/n) for k=1 to (n-1)/2 is -1/2 when n is odd. For n=7, which is odd, the sum would be -1/2. Wait, but n=7, so (n-1)/2 = 3. So sum_{k=1}^3 cos(2\u03c0k/7) = -1/2. Therefore, the sum of the roots is -1/2, so a = -(-1/2) = 1/2? Wait, no. Vieta's formula says sum of roots = -a. So if sum of roots is -1/2, then -a = -1/2, so a = 1/2. Wait, but the answer options don't have 1/2. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let's verify this sum. Let me compute the sum S = cos(2\u03c0/7) + cos(4\u03c0/7) + cos(6\u03c0/7). Let me recall that 6\u03c0/7 = \u03c0 - \u03c0/7, so cos(6\u03c0/7) = -cos(\u03c0/7). Similarly, 4\u03c0/7 = \u03c0 - 3\u03c0/7, so cos(4\u03c0/7) = -cos(3\u03c0/7). And 2\u03c0/7 is just 2\u03c0/7. So S = cos(2\u03c0/7) - cos(3\u03c0/7) - cos(\u03c0/7). Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe using complex exponentials.\n\nAlternatively, consider the 7th roots of unity. Let \u03c9 = e^(2\u03c0i/7). The sum of the real parts of \u03c9^k for k=1 to 6 is the sum of cos(2\u03c0k/7) for k=1 to 6. But the sum of all 7th roots of unity is zero, so sum_{k=0}^6 \u03c9^k = 0. Therefore, sum_{k=1}^6 \u03c9^k = -1. Taking real parts, sum_{k=1}^6 cos(2\u03c0k/7) = -1. But cos(2\u03c0k/7) for k=1 to 6 is symmetric. Note that cos(2\u03c0(7 - k)/7) = cos(2\u03c0 - 2\u03c0k/7) = cos(2\u03c0k/7). Wait, no: cos(2\u03c0(7 - k)/7) = cos(2\u03c0 - 2\u03c0k/7) = cos(2\u03c0k/7). So actually, the sum from k=1 to 6 is twice the sum from k=1 to 3. Because cos(2\u03c0k/7) for k=4,5,6 is the same as cos(2\u03c0(7 - k)/7) for k=3,2,1. So sum_{k=1}^6 cos(2\u03c0k/7) = 2[cos(2\u03c0/7) + cos(4\u03c0/7) + cos(6\u03c0/7)] = -1. Therefore, the sum S = [sum from k=1 to 3] cos(2\u03c0k/7) = -1/2. So indeed, the sum of the roots is -1/2, so a = -(-1/2) = 1/2. Wait, but the answer options don't have 1/2. Wait, the answer is supposed to be abc, so maybe a is 1/2, then b and c would be other fractions. Let's proceed.\n\nNext, Vieta's formula for the sum of products two at a time is b. So we need to compute cos(2\u03c0/7)cos(4\u03c0/7) + cos(4\u03c0/7)cos(6\u03c0/7) + cos(6\u03c0/7)cos(2\u03c0/7). This seems more complicated. Maybe using product-to-sum formulas. For example, cos A cos B = [cos(A+B) + cos(A-B)]/2.\n\nLet's compute each term:\n\nFirst term: cos(2\u03c0/7)cos(4\u03c0/7) = [cos(6\u03c0/7) + cos(-2\u03c0/7)]/2 = [cos(6\u03c0/7) + cos(2\u03c0/7)]/2.\n\nSecond term: cos(4\u03c0/7)cos(6\u03c0/7) = [cos(10\u03c0/7) + cos(-2\u03c0/7)]/2. But cos(10\u03c0/7) = cos(10\u03c0/7 - 2\u03c0) = cos(-4\u03c0/7) = cos(4\u03c0/7). And cos(-2\u03c0/7) = cos(2\u03c0/7). So this becomes [cos(4\u03c0/7) + cos(2\u03c0/7)]/2.\n\nThird term: cos(6\u03c0/7)cos(2\u03c0/7) = [cos(8\u03c0/7) + cos(4\u03c0/7)]/2. But cos(8\u03c0/7) = cos(8\u03c0/7 - 2\u03c0) = cos(-6\u03c0/7) = cos(6\u03c0/7). So this term becomes [cos(6\u03c0/7) + cos(4\u03c0/7)]/2.\n\nAdding all three terms:\n\nFirst term: [cos6\u03c0/7 + cos2\u03c0/7]/2\n\nSecond term: [cos4\u03c0/7 + cos2\u03c0/7]/2\n\nThird term: [cos6\u03c0/7 + cos4\u03c0/7]/2\n\nSum all three:\n\nTotal = [cos6\u03c0/7 + cos2\u03c0/7 + cos4\u03c0/7 + cos2\u03c0/7 + cos6\u03c0/7 + cos4\u03c0/7]/2\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n= [2cos2\u03c0/7 + 2cos4\u03c0/7 + 2cos6\u03c0/7]/2\n\n= [2*(cos2\u03c0/7 + cos4\u03c0/7 + cos6\u03c0/7)]/2\n\n= cos2\u03c0/7 + cos4\u03c0/7 + cos6\u03c0/7\n\nBut we already know this sum is -1/2. Therefore, the sum of products two at a time is b = -1/2. Wait, no. Wait, Vieta's formula says sum of products two at a time is b. Wait, but according to this calculation, the sum of products two at a time equals the sum of the roots, which is -1/2. But that can't be right. Wait, no, wait. Wait, when we applied the product-to-sum formula, each product term became a sum of cosines, and when we added all three products, the total became the sum of the roots. But the sum of the roots is -1/2, so then b = -1/2? Wait, but according to Vieta, the sum of products two at a time is b. Wait, but according to our calculation, the sum of products two at a time is equal to the sum of the roots, which is -1/2. Therefore, b = -1/2. But that seems conflicting. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, no. Let's re-express. The sum of products two at a time is:\n\ncos(2\u03c0/7)cos(4\u03c0/7) + cos(4\u03c0/7)cos(6\u03c0/7) + cos(6\u03c0/7)cos(2\u03c0/7)\n\nAfter applying product-to-sum, each term becomes [cos(A+B) + cos(A-B)]/2. Then when we sum all three terms, we end up with the sum of the roots (each appearing twice) divided by 2. Wait, let's redo this step.\n\nWait, when we expand each product:\n\nFirst term: [cos(6\u03c0/7) + cos(2\u03c0/7)]/2\n\nSecond term: [cos(10\u03c0/7) + cos(2\u03c0/7)]/2\n\nThird term: [cos(8\u03c0/7) + cos(4\u03c0/7)]/2\n\nBut 10\u03c0/7 is equivalent to 10\u03c0/7 - 2\u03c0 = -4\u03c0/7, so cos(10\u03c0/7) = cos(-4\u03c0/7) = cos(4\u03c0/7). Similarly, 8\u03c0/7 is equivalent to 8\u03c0/7 - 2\u03c0 = -6\u03c0/7, so cos(8\u03c0/7) = cos(-6\u03c0/7) = cos(6\u03c0/7). Therefore, the second term becomes [cos(4\u03c0/7) + cos(2\u03c0/7)]/2, and the third term becomes [cos(6\u03c0/7) + cos(4\u03c0/7)]/2.\n\nNow, adding all three terms:\n\nFirst term: [cos6\u03c0/7 + cos2\u03c0/7]/2\n\nSecond term: [cos4\u03c0/7 + cos2\u03c0/7]/2\n\nThird term: [cos6\u03c0/7 + cos4\u03c0/7]/2\n\nTotal sum:\n\n= [cos6\u03c0/7 + cos2\u03c0/7 + cos4\u03c0/7 + cos2\u03c0/7 + cos6\u03c0/7 + cos4\u03c0/7]/2\n\n= [2cos2\u03c0/7 + 2cos4\u03c0/7 + 2cos6\u03c0/7]/2\n\n= (2*(sum of roots))/2\n\n= sum of roots\n\nBut sum of roots is -1/2, so the sum of products two at a time is -1/2. Therefore, according to Vieta, this sum is equal to b. So b = -1/2.\n\nWait, but that would mean a = 1/2, b = -1/2. Then c is the negative of the product of the roots. The product of the roots is cos(2\u03c0/7)cos(4\u03c0/7)cos(6\u03c0/7). So c = -product.\n\nSo we need to compute the product of the three cosines. Let's compute that.\n\nHmm, how to compute cos(2\u03c0/7)cos(4\u03c0/7)cos(6\u03c0/7). There might be a trigonometric identity for this. Alternatively, using complex numbers.\n\nAlternatively, recall that for angles summing to \u03c0, there's a formula, but here the angles are 2\u03c0/7, 4\u03c0/7, 6\u03c0/7. Their sum is 12\u03c0/7, which is more than \u03c0. Not sure. Alternatively, use multiple-angle identities.\n\nAlternatively, consider that 2\u03c0/7, 4\u03c0/7, 6\u03c0/7 are related to the roots of certain equations. Let me think about the Chebyshev polynomials. Since the roots are cosines of angles that are multiples of 2\u03c0/7, perhaps there's a connection to the minimal polynomial of cos(2\u03c0/7).\n\nAlternatively, recall that cos(7\u03b8) = ... using multiple-angle formulas, and set \u03b8 = 2\u03c0/7, but 7\u03b8 = 2\u03c0, so cos(7\u03b8) = cos(2\u03c0) = 1. Maybe expand cos(7\u03b8) in terms of cos\u03b8 and set it equal to 1.\n\nLet me try that. The identity for cos(7\u03b8) can be written as a polynomial in cos\u03b8. Let's recall that cos(7\u03b8) = 64 cos^7\u03b8 - 112 cos^5\u03b8 + 56 cos^3\u03b8 - 7 cos\u03b8. But when \u03b8 = 2\u03c0/7, cos(7\u03b8) = cos(2\u03c0) = 1. So:\n\n1 = 64 cos^7\u03b8 - 112 cos^5\u03b8 + 56 cos^3\u03b8 - 7 cos\u03b8.\n\nLet x = cos\u03b8, where \u03b8 = 2\u03c0/7. Then:\n\n64x^7 - 112x^5 + 56x^3 - 7x - 1 = 0.\n\nBut this is a 7th-degree equation. However, we know that x = cos(2\u03c0/7) is a root, as well as cos(4\u03c0/7) and cos(6\u03c0/7), but maybe other roots as well. However, since the polynomial is of 7th degree, but we need a cubic polynomial. Perhaps this 7th-degree polynomial can be factored into lower-degree polynomials, one of which is cubic with roots cos(2\u03c0/7), cos(4\u03c0/7), cos(6\u03c0/7).\n\nAlternatively, note that cos(7\u03b8) = 1, so 64x^7 - 112x^5 + 56x^3 - 7x - 1 = 0. Let's factor this equation. Let's set x = 1, which gives 64 - 112 + 56 -7 -1 = 0. So x=1 is a root. Therefore, we can factor (x - 1) out. Let's perform polynomial division.\n\nDivide 64x^7 - 112x^5 + 56x^3 -7x -1 by (x - 1). Alternatively, use synthetic division. But this might be time-consuming. Alternatively, note that the equation can be written as (x - 1)(64x^6 + 64x^5 - 48x^4 - 48x^3 + 8x^2 + 8x +1) = 0. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, since we are interested in the roots cos(2\u03c0/7), cos(4\u03c0/7), cos(6\u03c0/7), which are distinct and real, and the other roots would be cos(8\u03c0/7), cos(10\u03c0/7), cos(12\u03c0/7), and x=1. But cos(8\u03c0/7) = cos(6\u03c0/7), cos(10\u03c0/7) = cos(4\u03c0/7), cos(12\u03c0/7) = cos(2\u03c0/7), so actually, the roots are x=1 and the three cosines each appearing twice. Wait, no. Wait, cos(8\u03c0/7) = cos(8\u03c0/7 - 2\u03c0) = cos(-6\u03c0/7) = cos(6\u03c0/7). Similarly, cos(10\u03c0/7) = cos(10\u03c0/7 - 2\u03c0) = cos(-4\u03c0/7) = cos(4\u03c0/7). Cos(12\u03c0/7) = cos(12\u03c0/7 - 2\u03c0) = cos(-2\u03c0/7) = cos(2\u03c0/7). So the roots are x=1, and the three cosines each appearing twice. Therefore, the polynomial can be factored as (x - 1)(x - cos2\u03c0/7)^2(x - cos4\u03c0/7)^2(x - cos6\u03c0/7)^2. But this would be a 7th-degree polynomial. However, our original equation is 64x^7 - ... -1 =0. Alternatively, perhaps the minimal polynomial for cos(2\u03c0/7) is cubic. Let me check.\n\nYes, actually, the minimal polynomial for cos(2\u03c0/7) is a cubic equation. Let me recall that. Let me look it up mentally. The minimal polynomial for cos(2\u03c0/7) is 8x\u00b3 +4x\u00b2 -4x -1=0. Wait, let me verify.\n\nSuppose that the minimal polynomial is 8x\u00b3 +4x\u00b2 -4x -1=0. Then the roots would be cos(2\u03c0/7), cos(4\u03c0/7), cos(6\u03c0/7). Let's check if this is the case.\n\nIf we let x = cos(2\u03c0/7), then substituting into 8x\u00b3 +4x\u00b2 -4x -1, does it equal zero?\n\nAlternatively, using the identity for cos(7\u03b8) = 1. Let me see. Let\u2019s use the equation we derived earlier: 64x^7 - 112x^5 +56x^3 -7x -1=0. If we factor out (x -1), we get",

I remember something about modular arithmetic from my math classes. Maybe I can use that here.\n\nFirst, when dealing with exponents in modular arithmetic, patterns often repeat because there are only a finite number of possible remainders. For example, if I take powers of 5 modulo 7, the remainders might cycle after a certain point. Let me check that.\n\nLet's start by calculating the first few powers of 5 modulo 7 and see if there's a pattern.\n\n5^1 mod 7 is 5, because 5 divided by 7 is 0 with remainder 5.\n\n5^2 is 25. Dividing 25 by 7 gives 3*7=21, remainder 4. So 5^2 \u2261 4 mod 7.\n\n5^3 would be 5^2 * 5, which is 4*5=20. 20 divided by 7 is 2*7=14, remainder 6. So 5^3 \u2261 6 mod 7.\n\n5^4 is 5^3 *5 =6*5=30. 30 divided by 7 is 4*7=28, remainder 2. So 5^4 \u22612 mod7.\n\n5^5 is 2*5=10. 10 divided by 7 is 1*7=7, remainder 3.

So every 6th power, it cycles back to 1. That suggests that the powers of 5 modulo 7 repeat every 6 exponents. So the cycle length here is 6.\n\nIf that's the case, then 5^(6k) \u22611 mod7 for any integer k. So 5^6 \u22611, 5^12 \u22611, 5^18 \u22611, etc. So 5^30 is 5^(6*5), which would be (5^6)^5. Since 5^6 \u22611 mod7, then (1)^5 \u22611 mod7. Therefore, 5^30 \u22611 mod7. So the remainder is 1.\n\nBut let me verify this pattern again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's list out the exponents and their remainders:\n\n5^1 \u22615 mod7\n\n5^2 \u22614 mod7\n\n5^3 \u22616 mod7\n\n5^4 \u22612 mod7\n\n5^5 \u22613 mod7\n\n5^6 \u22611 mod7\n\n5^7 would be 5^6 *5 \u22611*5=5 mod7, which brings us back to 5, so the cycle repeats every 6 exponents. That's correct.\n\nTherefore, since 30 divided by 6 is 5 with no remainder, 5^30 is the 5th term in the cycle (since 6*5=30), which is the same as 5^6, 5^12, etc., all of which are \u22611 mod7. Hence, the remainder is indeed 1.\n\nAlternatively, using Fermat's little theorem, which states that if p is a prime number and a is not divisible by p, then a^(p-1) \u22611 mod p. Here, 7 is prime, and 5 is not divisible by 7, so 5^(7-1)=5^6 \u22611 mod7. Then 5^30 = (5^6)^5 \u22611^5=1 mod7. That's another way to see it, using Fermat's theorem directly. But since the problem might not assume knowledge of Fermat's theorem, the pattern observation method is more elementary and still valid.\n\nEither way, the conclusion is the same: the remainder is 1.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo find the remainder when \\(5^{30}\\) is divided by 7, we observe patterns in the powers of 5 modulo 7. Calculating the first few powers:\n\n- \\(5^1 \\equiv 5 \\mod 7\\)\n- \\(5^2 = 25 \\equiv 4 \\mod 7\\)\n- \\(5^3 = 5 \\cdot 4 = 20 \\equiv 6 \\mod 7\\)\n- \\(5^4 = 5 \\cdot 6 = 30 \\equiv 2 \\mod 7\\)\n- \\(5^5 = 5 \\cdot 2 = 10 \\equiv 3 \\mod 7\\)\n- \\(5^6 = 5 \\cdot 3 = 15 \\equiv 1 \\mod 7\\)\n\nHere, \\(5^6 \\equiv 1 \\mod 7\\), revealing a repeating cycle of length 6. Since \\(30 = 6 \\times 5\\), we write \\(5^{30} = (5^6)^5\\). Substituting \\(5^6 \\equiv 1\\) into this expression gives \\((1)^5 \\equiv 1 \\mod 7\\). Thus, the remainder when \\(5^{30}\\) is divided by 7 is **1**. This aligns with Fermat\u2019s Little Theorem (for prime modulus 7 and base 5), which guarantees \\(5^{6} \\equiv 1 \\mod 7\\), extending to \\(5^{6k} \\equiv 1 \\mod 7\\) for any integer \\(k\\).",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the number n such that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of n and 40 is 10, and the least common multiple (lcm) of n and 40 is 280. And then show that n is 70. Hmm, how do I approach this?\n\nFirst, I remember that there's a relationship between gcd and lcm of two numbers. Oh right! The product of the gcd and lcm of two numbers equals the product of the numbers themselves. So, gcd(a, b) * lcm(a, b) = a * b. Let me check if that applies here.\n\nGiven that gcd(n, 40) = 10 and lcm(n, 40) = 280, then according to the formula, 10 * 280 should equal n * 40. Let me calculate that. 10 times 280 is 2800, and n times 40 is 2800. So, n would be 2800 divided by 40. Let me do that division: 2800 \u00f7 40. Well, 40 times 70 is 2800, so n must be 70. That seems straightforward, but wait, maybe I should verify if 70 actually satisfies both the gcd and lcm conditions.\n\nLet's check the gcd first. The gcd of 70 and 40. Let's list the divisors of 70: 1, 2, 5, 7, 10, 14, 35, 70. Divisors of 40: 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 40. The common divisors are 1, 2, 5, 10. The greatest one is 10. Okay, that matches the given gcd.\n\nNow the lcm. The lcm of 70 and 40. One way to find lcm is to divide the product by the gcd. So, (70 * 40)/10 = 2800/10 = 280. That's exactly the given lcm. So yes, 70 works.\n\nBut wait, is there any other number that could satisfy these conditions? Let me think. Suppose there's another number n that also has gcd 10 with 40 and lcm 280. According to the formula, n would have to be 70 because the product is fixed. So, n must be 70. Therefore, 70 is the unique solution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this by prime factorization. Let's factorize 40 and 70. 40 is 2^3 * 5^1. 70 is 2^1 * 5^1 * 7^1. The gcd is the product of the minimum exponents of shared primes. So, min(2^3, 2^1) is 2^1, min(5^1,5^1) is 5^1, and 7 is not in 40. So gcd is 2*5=10. That's correct.\n\nThe lcm is the product of the maximum exponents. For 2, max(3,1)=3; for 5, max(1,1)=1; and include 7^1. So lcm is 2^3 *5^1 *7^1 = 8*5*7=280. That matches too. So prime factorization confirms it.\n\nTherefore, n=70 is the only number that satisfies both conditions.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo find the integer \\( n \\) such that \\( \\gcd(n, 40) = 10 \\) and \\( \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[n, 40] = 280 \\), we use the fundamental relationship between the greatest common divisor (gcd) and least common multiple (lcm) of two numbers.

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about AC circuits using complex numbers. The equation given is V = IZ, where V is voltage, I is current, and Z is impedance. We need to find I when V is 1+i and Z is 2-i. The answer should be (1/5) + (3/5)i.\n\nFirst, I remember from the context example that when solving for z in a complex equation, they isolated z by dividing both sides by the coefficient. In the example, they had (2+i)z + i = 3, and they subtracted i, then divided by (2+i). Then they multiplied numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator to simplify. The conjugate was 2-i in that case, which is similar to the Z here being 2-i. \n\nSo here, the equation is V = IZ. To solve for I, we need to isolate it. That would mean dividing both sides by Z. So I = V/Z. Given V is 1+i and Z is 2-i, so substituting those in, I = (1+i)/(2-i). \n\nNow, to simplify this complex fraction, we multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. The conjugate of 2-i is 2+i. Wait, wait, the denominator here is 2 - i, so its conjugate should be 2 + i. Because the conjugate of a complex number a + bi is a - bi. So in the example, they multiplied by 2 - i when the denominator was 2 + i. So here, denominator is 2 - i, so conjugate is 2 + i. \n\nSo multiply numerator and denominator by 2 + i. Let's compute that. \n\nNumerator: (1 + i)(2 + i). Let's expand that. 1*2 = 2, 1*i = i, i*2 = 2i, i*i = i\u00b2. So total is 2 + i + 2i + i\u00b2. Combine like terms: 2 + 3i + (-1) because i\u00b2 is -1. So 2 -1 is 1, so numerator becomes 1 + 3i.\n\nDenominator: (2 - i)(2 + i). That's a difference of squares. (2)^2 - (i)^2 = 4 - (-1) = 5. So denominator is 5.\n\nTherefore, I = (1 + 3i)/5 = (1/5) + (3/5)i. Which matches the expected result. \n\nWait, let me check the multiplication again. For the numerator: (1+i)(2+i). Let's do it step by step. 1*2 = 2, 1*i = i, i*2 = 2i, i*i = i\u00b2. So adding those up: 2 + i + 2i + i\u00b2. Combine the i terms: 3i. Then 2 + 3i + (-1) = 1 + 3i. Yes, that's correct. \n\nDenominator: (2 - i)(2 + i) = 2^2 - (i)^2 = 4 - (-1) = 5. Correct. So dividing numerator by denominator gives (1 + 3i)/5, which is 1/5 + 3/5 i. \n\nSo the steps are: start with V=IZ, solve for I by dividing both sides by Z. Substitute the given V and Z. Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator to rationalize it. Then expand and simplify. The key step is using the conjugate to eliminate the imaginary part in the denominator, which is a standard technique when dealing with complex numbers. The example provided in the context did a similar thing, multiplying by the conjugate to simplify the expression. This problem follows the same pattern, just with different numbers. So the answer comes out as expected.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo find the current \\( I \\) in the AC circuit equation \\( V = IZ \\), we start by rearranging the formula to solve for \\( I \\). Dividing both sides by \\( Z \\), we get \\( I = \\frac{V}{Z} \\). Substituting the given values \\( V = 1 + i \\) and \\( Z = 2 - i \\), this becomes:\n\n\\[\nI = \\frac{1 + i}{2 - i}.\n\\]\n\nTo simplify this complex fraction, we multiply the numerator and denominator by the **conjugate** of the denominator. The conjugate of \\( 2 - i \\) is \\( 2 + i \\). This step eliminates the imaginary unit \\( i \\) in the denominator. Applying this:\n\n\\[\nI = \\frac{(1 + i)(2 + i)}{(2 - i)(2 + i)}.\n\\]\n\nFirst, expand the numerator:\n\\[\n(1 + i)(2 + i) = 1 \\cdot 2 + 1 \\cdot i + i \\cdot 2 + i \\cdot i = 2 + i + 2i + i^2.\n\\]\nSince \\( i^2 = -1 \\), this simplifies to:\n\\[\n2 + 3i - 1 = 1 + 3i.\n\\]\n\nNext, compute the denominator using the difference of squares:\n\\[\n(2 - i)(2 + i) = 2^2 - i^2 = 4 - (-1) = 5.\n\\]\n\nPutting it all together:\n\\[\nI = \\frac{1 + 3i}{5} = \\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{3}{5}i.\n\\]\n\nThis matches the expected result. The key idea is using the conjugate to simplify the denominator, a common technique when dividing complex numbers. The process mirrors the example in the context, where multiplying by the conjugate resolved the imaginary component in the denominator.\nPrevious attempt failed with: type mismatch\n  h\u2081\nhas type\n  i * (2 - Complex.I) = 1 + Complex.I : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  2 - Complex.I \u2260 0 : Prop\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: type mismatch\n  h\u2081\nhas type\n  i.re * 2 + i.im = 1 \u2227 -i.re + i.im * 2 = 1 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  i.re * 5 = 1 \u2227 i.im * 5 = 3 : Prop\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: type mismatch\n  h\u2081\nhas type\n  i.re * 2 + i.im = 1 \u2227 -i.re + i.im * 2 = 1 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  i.re * 5 = 1 \u2227 i.im * 5 = 3 : Prop\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is about finding which statement is not true given that the sum 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/7 + 1/n is an integer. The options are about divisibility by 2, 3, 6, 7, and whether n is greater than 84. We need to show that option E (n > 84) is not necessarily true.\n\nFirst, let's understand the given equation. The sum of these reciprocals equals an integer. Let's denote that integer as k. So:\n\n1/2 + 1/3 + 1/7 + 1/n = k, where k is an integer.\n\nOur goal is to find possible values of n that satisfy this equation and then check the divisibility conditions and the statement about n being greater than 84.\n\nLet's compute the sum of the known fractions first. Let's find 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/7. To add these, we need a common denominator. The denominators are 2, 3, and 7. The least common multiple (LCM) of 2, 3, and 7 is 42. So converting each fraction:\n\n1/2 = 21/42,\n1/3 = 14/42,\n1/7 = 6/42.\n\nAdding these together: 21 + 14 + 6 = 41, so the sum is 41/42.\n\nTherefore, the equation becomes:\n\n41/42 + 1/n = k.\n\nSubtracting 41/42 from both sides gives:\n\n1/n = k - 41/42.\n\nLet's express the right-hand side as a single fraction. Since k is an integer, k can be written as (42k)/42. So:\n\n1/n = (42k - 41)/42.\n\nTaking reciprocals of both sides:\n\nn = 42 / (42k - 41).\n\nSince n must be a positive integer, the denominator (42k - 41) must be a positive divisor of 42. Let's note that 42k - 41 must divide 42 and also be positive. Let's denote d = 42k - 41. Then d must be a positive divisor of 42, and d divides 42. The positive divisors of 42 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, 42.\n\nSo, d \u2208 {1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, 42}.\n\nBut d = 42k - 41. Let's solve for k in each case.\n\nFor each divisor d, we can write:\n\n42k - 41 = d \u21d2 k = (d + 41)/42.\n\nSince k must be an integer, (d + 41) must be divisible by 42. Let's check each d:\n\n1. d = 1: d + 41 = 42 \u21d2 42/42 = 1 \u21d2 k = 1. Valid.\n2. d = 2: 2 + 41 = 43 \u21d2 43/42 is not an integer. Invalid.\n3. d = 3: 3 + 41 = 44 \u21d2 44/42 = 22/21. Not integer. Invalid.\n4. d = 6: 6 + 41 = 47 \u21d2 47/42. Not integer. Invalid.\n5. d = 7: 7 + 41 = 48 \u21d2 48/42 = 16/14 = 8/7. Not integer. Wait, 48 divided by 42 is 1.142..., which is 8/7. Not integer. So invalid.\n6. d = 14: 14 + 41 = 55 \u21d2 55/42 \u2248 1.3095. Not integer.\n7. d = 21: 21 + 41 = 62 \u21d2 62/42 = 31/21. Not integer.\n8. d = 42: 42 + 41 = 83 \u21d2 83/42 \u2248 1.976. Not integer.\n\nSo the only valid case is d = 1. Therefore, k = 1, and then:\n\nn = 42 / (42*1 - 41) = 42 / (42 - 41) = 42 / 1 = 42.\n\nWait, that's the only solution? So n = 42. Let's check this.\n\nPlugging back into the original equation:\n\n1/2 + 1/3 + 1/7 + 1/42 = ?\n\nCompute each term:\n\n1/2 = 21/42,\n\n1/3 = 14/42,\n\n1/7 = 6/42,\n\n1/42 = 1/42.\n\nAdding them up: 21 + 14 + 6 + 1 = 42/42 = 1. Correct. So the sum is 1, which is an integer. So n = 42 is the only solution.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the following statements is not true\". Let's check the options.\n\nOptions:\n\nA) 2 divides n. Since n=42, 42 is divisible by 2. True.\n\nB) 3 divides n. 42 \u00f73=14. True.\n\nC) 6 divides n. 42 \u00f76=7. True.\n\nD) 7 divides n. 42 \u00f77=6. True.\n\nE) n >84. 42 is not greater than 84. So E is false.\n\nTherefore, the statement that is not true is E. Hence, the answer is E.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"Which of the following statements is not true\". So all options A-D are true for n=42, and E is false. Therefore, E is the statement that is not true.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"Show that it is (E) n >84.\" So our conclusion is correct.\n\nBut let's make sure there are no other possible n. The above analysis shows that the only possible n is 42. Because when we considered all divisors of 42, only d=1 gives an integer k. Therefore, n=42 is the only solution. Hence, E is not true because 42 is not greater than 84.\n\nBut wait, could there be other values of n? Let's double-check.\n\nSuppose we consider negative divisors? But n must be a positive integer, so the denominator (42k -41) must be positive. Therefore, 42k -41 >0 \u21d2 k > 41/42 \u22480.976. Since k is an integer, k \u22651. So k starts at 1. For k=1, we get n=42. For k=2, let's see:\n\nIf k=2, then 1/n = 2 - 41/42 = (84 -41)/42 = 43/42. Then n=42/43, which is not an integer. So invalid.\n\nSimilarly, for k=3: 1/n =3 -41/42= (126 -41)/42=85/42 \u21d2n=42/85, not integer.\n\nFor k=0: 1/n =0 -41/42= -41/42 \u21d2n negative, invalid.\n\nThus, the only possible n is 42. Therefore, the answer is E, which claims n>84 is not true because 42 is not greater than 84.\n\nTherefore, the statement that is not true is E.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nLet's start by analyzing the given equation: \\(\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{7} + \\frac{1}{n}\\) must be an integer.

Substituting back, \\(n = \\frac{42}{1} = 42\\).\n- All other divisors (e.g., \\(2, 3, 6, ...\\)) lead to non-integer values for \\(k\\), which are invalid.\n\nThus, the **only solution** is \\(n = 42\\).

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The question is asking: For how many positive integers m does there exist at least one positive integer n such that m\u00b7n \u2264 m + n? And the options are given, but we need to show that the answer is (E) infinitely many.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the inequality m\u00b7n \u2264 m + n means. Let me rearrange it to see if that helps. If I subtract m and n from both sides, I get m\u00b7n - m - n \u2264 0. Hmm, maybe factor it? Let's see: m\u00b7n - m - n = m(n - 1) - n. Not sure if that's helpful. Alternatively, add 1 to both sides: m\u00b7n - m - n + 1 \u2264 1. Then, factor the left side as (m - 1)(n - 1) \u2264 1. Oh, that's a clever move! Let me check that:\n\n(m - 1)(n - 1) = m\u00b7n - m - n + 1. So yes, adding 1 to both sides of the original inequality gives (m - 1)(n - 1) \u2264 1. So the original inequality m\u00b7n \u2264 m + n is equivalent to (m - 1)(n - 1) \u2264 1.\n\nNow, since m and n are positive integers, both m - 1 and n - 1 are non-negative integers (since m and n are at least 1). So the product of two non-negative integers is \u2264 1. Let's think about possible cases for (m - 1)(n - 1) \u2264 1.\n\nThe product of two non-negative integers being \u22641 can only happen in a few cases. The possible non-negative integer solutions (a, b) to a\u00b7b \u2264 1 are:\n\n- a = 0 and b can be any non-negative integer (since 0\u00b7b = 0 \u22641)\n- b = 0 and a can be any non-negative integer\n- a = 1 and b = 1 (since 1\u00b71=1 \u22641)\n- a =1 and b=0, but that's covered in the first case\n- Similarly, b=1 and a=0 is covered.\n\nWait, but since a and b are m-1 and n-1, which are non-negative integers, let's translate back to m and n.\n\nCase 1: m - 1 = 0 \u21d2 m = 1. Then, regardless of n, since (0)(n -1) =0 \u22641. So for m=1, any n\u22651 satisfies the inequality. So m=1 definitely works.\n\nCase 2: n -1 =0 \u21d2 n=1. Then, (m -1)(0)=0 \u22641. So for any m\u22651, if we choose n=1, the inequality holds. Wait, but the problem states \"there exists at least one positive integer n such that...\". So for any m, if we can choose n=1, then m\u00b71 \u2264 m +1. Let's check that: m \u2264 m +1, which is always true. So for every m\u22651, choosing n=1 makes the inequality hold. Therefore, every positive integer m has at least one n (specifically n=1) that satisfies the inequality. Therefore, there are infinitely many such m.\n\nWait, but that contradicts the answer choices given, because option E is \"infinitely many\", which would be correct. But let me double-check this reasoning.\n\nWait, the problem says \"For how many positive integers m does there exist at least one positive integer n such that m\u00b7n \u2264 m + n?\" If for every m, n=1 works, then every m is valid, hence infinitely many. So the answer should be E. But let me check with m=2. If m=2, n=1: 2\u00b71=2 \u22642+1=3, which is true. For m=3, n=1: 3 \u22644, true. Similarly, m=1000, n=1: 1000 \u22641001, true. So indeed, for every m, n=1 works. Therefore, all positive integers m satisfy the condition, so there are infinitely many such m. Hence, the answer is E.\n\nBut wait, the problem is presented as a multiple-choice question with options up to 12, and E is \"infinitely many\". So according to this reasoning, the answer is E. But maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the original inequality is m\u00b7n \u2264 m +n. Let's rearrange it as m\u00b7n - m -n \u22640. Then, adding 1 to both sides gives (m-1)(n-1) \u22641. So yes, that's correct. So (m-1)(n-1) \u22641. Now, since m and n are positive integers, m-1 and n-1 are non-negative integers. The product of two non-negative integers being \u22641. So possible cases:\n\nEither one of them is 0, or both are 1.\n\nSo:\n\nEither m-1=0 \u21d2 m=1, and n can be any positive integer.\n\nOr n-1=0 \u21d2 n=1, and m can be any positive integer.\n\nOr both m-1=1 and n-1=1 \u21d2 m=2 and n=2.\n\nBut wait, if m=2 and n=2, then 2\u00b72=4 \u22642+2=4, which is true (since 4\u22644). So that's another case where m=2 and n=2 works. But even if we didn't consider that, the main point is that for any m\u22651, choosing n=1 will satisfy the inequality. Therefore, every m has at least one n (n=1) that works. Therefore, there are infinitely many such m. Hence, the answer is E.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a mistake here. Let me test m=1. For m=1, n can be any positive integer. So m=1 works. For m=2, n=1 works. For m=3, n=1 works. So indeed, every m works. Therefore, the answer is E, infinitely many. So the correct answer is E.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo determine how many positive integers \\( m \\) satisfy the condition that there exists at least one positive integer \\( n \\) such that \\( m \\cdot n \\le m + n \\), we start by analyzing the inequality. Rearranging terms, we have:\n\n\\[\nm \\cdot n - m - n \\le 0.\n\\]\n\nAdding \\( 1 \\) to both sides allows us to factor the left-hand side:\n\n\\[\n(m - 1)(n - 1) \\le 1.\n\\]\n\nHere, \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are positive integers, so \\( m - 1 \\) and \\( n - 1 \\) are non-negative integers. The product of two non-negative integers being at most \\( 1 \\) restricts the possible cases:\n\n1. **Case 1:** \\( m - 1 = 0 \\) (i.e., \\( m = 1 \\)).  \n   For \\( m = 1 \\), the inequality simplifies to \\( 0 \\cdot (n - 1) \\le 1 \\), which is always true for any \\( n \\ge 1 \\). Thus, \\( m = 1 \\) works.\n\n2. **Case 2:** \\( n - 1 = 0 \\) (i.e., \\( n = 1 \\)).  \n   For \\( n = 1 \\), the inequality becomes \\( (m - 1) \\cdot 0 \\le 1 \\), which holds for **any** \\( m \\ge 1 \\). This means that for **every** positive integer \\( m \\), choosing \\( n = 1 \\) satisfies the original inequality \\( m \\cdot 1 \\le m + 1 \\), which simplifies to \\( m \\le m + 1 \\), a universally true statement.\n\n3. **Case 3:** \\( (m - 1)(n - 1) = 1 \\).  \n   This occurs only when \\( m - 1 = 1 \\) and \\( n - 1 = 1 \\), i.e., \\( m = 2 \\) and \\( n = 2 \\). While this is a valid solution, it is already subsumed by the generality of Case 2, where \\( n = 1 \\) works for all \\( m \\).\n\nThe critical observation is that **Case 2 applies to every positive integer \\( m \\)**. By choosing \\( n = 1 \\), the inequality \\( m \\cdot n \\le m + n \\) is trivially satisfied for any \\( m \\). Therefore, there are infinitely many positive integers \\( m \\) that meet the condition, as every \\( m \\ge 1 \\) has at least one corresponding \\( n = 1 \\).\n\n**Conclusion:** The answer is \\(\\boxed{E}\\), infinitely many.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how many perfect squares divide the product of all factorials from 1! up to 9!. The answer choices are given, and I need to show that the correct answer is B) 672. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the product in question is 1! \u00d7 2! \u00d7 3! \u00d7 ... \u00d7 9!. To find the number of perfect square divisors of this product, I remember that a perfect square has even exponents in its prime factorization. So, the strategy should be to find the prime factorization of the entire product, determine the exponents of each prime, then for each prime, calculate how many ways we can choose an even exponent (including zero) up to the maximum exponent in the product. Then multiply all those possibilities together to get the total number of square divisors.\n\nBut first, let's break down how to compute the exponents of each prime in the product. Each factorial from 1! to 9! contributes to the exponents of primes in the overall product. For example, 2! contributes a 2, 3! contributes a 2 and a 3, and so on. However, since each factorial builds on the previous ones, the exponents of primes in the product will accumulate as we go from 1! to 9!.\n\nWait, actually, the product is 1! \u00d7 2! \u00d7 3! \u00d7 ... \u00d7 9!. So each term k! (for k from 1 to 9) is multiplied together. So, for each prime number p, I need to calculate the total exponent of p in the entire product. Then, once I have that exponent, say e_p, the number of choices for the exponent in a square divisor is floor(e_p / 2) + 1. Then multiply all these together.\n\nSo the key steps are:\n\n1. List all primes up to 9, since 9! is the largest factorial here. The primes are 2, 3, 5, 7.\n\n2. For each prime p (2, 3, 5, 7), compute the exponent of p in the product 1!\u00d72!\u00d7...\u00d79!.\n\n3. For each exponent e_p, compute the number of even exponents possible, which is (floor(e_p / 2) + 1).\n\n4. Multiply all these numbers together to get the total number of square divisors.\n\nSo let's tackle each prime one by one.\n\nStarting with prime 2:\n\nWe need to find the total exponent of 2 in each factorial from 1! to 9! and sum them all.\n\nFor a single factorial k!, the exponent of 2 is given by the sum floor(k/2) + floor(k/4) + floor(k/8) + ... until the division yields zero.\n\nBut since we are multiplying multiple factorials together (1!\u00d72!\u00d7...\u00d79!), the exponent of 2 in the entire product is the sum over each k! (from k=1 to 9) of the exponents of 2 in k!.\n\nSo for each k from 1 to 9, compute the exponent of 2 in k! and sum all those exponents.\n\nSimilarly for primes 3, 5, 7.\n\nLet me compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, for prime 2:\n\nCompute the exponent of 2 in each k! (k=1 to 9):\n\nFor k=1: floor(1/2) + floor(1/4) + ... = 0\n\nk=2: floor(2/2) + floor(2/4) + ... = 1 + 0 = 1\n\nk=3: floor(3/2)=1 + floor(3/4)=0 \u2192 1\n\nk=4: floor(4/2)=2 + floor(4/4)=1 + floor(4/8)=0 \u2192 3\n\nk=5: floor(5/2)=2 + floor(5/4)=1 + floor(5/8)=0 \u2192 3\n\nk=6: floor(6/2)=3 + floor(6/4)=1 + floor(6/8)=0 \u2192 4\n\nk=7: floor(7/2)=3 + floor(7/4)=1 + floor(7/8)=0 \u2192 4\n\nk=8: floor(8/2)=4 + floor(8/4)=2 + floor(8/8)=1 + floor(8/16)=0 \u2192 7\n\nk=9: floor(9/2)=4 + floor(9/4)=2 + floor(9/8)=1 + floor(9/16)=0 \u2192 7\n\nSo the exponents of 2 in each k! are:\n\nk=1: 0\n\nk=2:1\n\nk=3:1\n\nk=4:3\n\nk=5:3\n\nk=6:4\n\nk=7:4\n\nk=8:7\n\nk=9:7\n\nNow sum all these exponents for the total exponent of 2 in the product:\n\n0 +1 +1 +3 +3 +4 +4 +7 +7 = Let's compute:\n\n0 +1=1\n\n1+1=2\n\n2+3=5\n\n5+3=8\n\n8+4=12\n\n12+4=16\n\n16+7=23\n\n23+7=30\n\nSo total exponent of 2 is 30.\n\nNext, prime 3:\n\nSimilarly, compute the exponent of 3 in each k! from k=1 to 9.\n\nFor each k!:\n\nExponent of 3 is floor(k/3) + floor(k/9) + floor(k/27) + ... \n\nCompute for each k:\n\nk=1: 0\n\nk=2:0\n\nk=3: floor(3/3)=1 + floor(3/9)=0 \u21921\n\nk=4: floor(4/3)=1 +0=1\n\nk=5: floor(5/3)=1 +0=1\n\nk=6: floor(6/3)=2 + floor(6/9)=0 \u21922\n\nk=7: floor(7/3)=2 +0=2\n\nk=8: floor(8/3)=2 +0=2\n\nk=9: floor(9/3)=3 + floor(9/9)=1 +0=4\n\nSo exponents of 3 in each k!:\n\nk=1:0\n\nk=2:0\n\nk=3:1\n\nk=4:1\n\nk=5:1\n\nk=6:2\n\nk=7:2\n\nk=8:2\n\nk=9:4\n\nSum these:\n\n0+0=0\n\n0+1=1\n\n1+1=2\n\n2+1=3\n\n3+2=5\n\n5+2=7\n\n7+2=9\n\n9+4=13\n\nTotal exponent of 3 is 13.\n\nPrime 5:\n\nExponent of 5 in each k!

So the answer is 672.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the exponents. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the exponents for each prime in the product.\n\nLet me verify the exponents again, especially for primes 2 and 3.\n\nStarting with prime 2:\n\nFor each k from 1 to 9, the exponent of 2 in k! is:\n\nk=1: 0\n\nk=2: floor(2/2)=1, floor(2/4)=0 \u21921\n\nk=3: floor(3/2)=1, floor(3/4)=0 \u21921\n\nk=4: floor(4/2)=2, floor(4/4)=1, floor(4/8)=0 \u21923\n\nk=5: floor(5/2)=2, floor(5/4)=1, floor(5/8)=0 \u21923\n\nk=6: floor(6/2)=3, floor(6/4)=1, floor(6/8)=0 \u21924\n\nk=7: floor(7/2)=3, floor(7/4)=1, floor(7/8)=0 \u21924\n\nk=8: floor(8/2)=4, floor(8/4)=2, floor(8/8)=1, floor(8/16)=0 \u21927\n\nk=9: floor(9/2)=4, floor(9/4)=2, floor(9/8)=1, floor(9/16)=0 \u21927\n\nSumming these:\n\n0 (k=1) +\n\n1 (k=2) total=1 +\n\n1 (k=3) total=2 +\n\n3 (k=4) total=5 +\n\n3 (k=5) total=8 +\n\n4 (k=6) total=12 +\n\n4 (k=7) total=16 +\n\n7 (k=8) total=23 +\n\n7 (k=9) total=30.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify primes up to 9**: These are \\(2, 3, 5, 7\\).\n2. **Compute exponents for each prime in the product**:\n   - **Prime 2**: For each factorial \\(k!\\) (from \\(1!\\) to \\(9!\\)), calculate the exponent of 2 using Legendre\u2019s formula \\(\\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty} \\left\\lfloor \\frac{k}{2^i} \\right\\rfloor\\). Summing these across all \\(k!\\) gives a total exponent of **30**.\n   - **Prime 3**: Similarly, compute exponents for 3 in each \\(k!\\). Total exponent: **13**.\n   - **Prime 5**: Only appears in \\(5!\\) to \\(9!\\). Total exponent: **5**.\n   - **Prime 7**: Only appears in \\(7!\\) to \\(9!\\). Total exponent: **3**.\n\n3. **Determine valid even exponents for each prime**:\n   - For \\(2^{30}\\): Even exponents range from \\(0\\) to \\(30\\) (step 2). There are \\(30/2 + 1 = 16\\) choices.\n   - For \\(3^{13}\\): Even exponents range from \\(0\\) to \\(12\\). Choices: \\(13//2 + 1 = 7\\).\n   - For \\(5^{5}\\): Even exponents \\(0, 2, 4\\). Choices: \\(5//2 + 1 = 3\\).\n   - For \\(7^{3}\\): Even exponents \\(0, 2\\). Choices: \\(3//2 + 1 = 2\\).\n\n4. **Multiply the choices**: \\(16 \\times 7 \\times 3 \\times 2 = 672\\).\n\nThus, the number of perfect square divisors of \\(1! \\cdot 2! \\cdots 9!\\) is **672**.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve the equation (8\u207b\u00b9)/(4\u207b\u00b9) - a\u207b\u00b9 = 1 for a and show that the solution is -2. Hmm, first, I should recall how negative exponents work. From the context given, there's a theorem that says a\u207b\u02e3 = 1/(a\u02e3). So, applying that here might simplify things.\n\nStarting with the first term: 8\u207b\u00b9. Using the theorem, that's 1/8. Similarly, 4\u207b\u00b9 is 1/4. So the equation becomes (1/8) divided by (1/4) minus 1/a equals 1. Wait, dividing fractions. Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. So (1/8) divided by (1/4) is (1/8) * (4/1) = 4/8 = 1/2. So now the equation simplifies to 1/2 - 1/a = 1.\n\nNext, I need to solve for a. Let's rearrange the equation. Subtract 1/2 from both sides: -1/a = 1 - 1/2. That simplifies to -1/a = 1/2. Then, multiplying both sides by -1 gives 1/a = -1/2. Taking reciprocals of both sides, a = -2. That makes sense. Let me check each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, when I took reciprocals, since 1/a = -1/2, flipping both sides gives a = -2. Yes, that's correct. Let me verify by plugging a = -2 back into the original equation. Compute each term: 8\u207b\u00b9 is 1/8, 4\u207b\u00b9 is 1/4. Then (1/8)/(1/4) = (1/8)*(4/1) = 1/2. Then a\u207b\u00b9 is (-2)\u207b\u00b9 which is -1/2. So the equation becomes 1/2 - (-1/2) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1, which matches the right-hand side. So it checks out. Therefore, a = -2 is indeed the correct solution.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nLet's solve the equation \\(\\dfrac{8^{-1}}{4^{-1}} - a^{-1} = 1\\) step by step.\n\n1. **Simplify the fraction with negative exponents**:\n   - By the theorem \\(a^{-x} = \\dfrac{1}{a^x}\\), we rewrite:\n     \\[\n     \\dfrac{8^{-1}}{4^{-1}} = \\dfrac{\\frac{1}{8}}{\\frac{1}{4}}.\n     \\]\n   - Dividing by \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) is equivalent to multiplying by \\(4\\):\n     \\[\n     \\dfrac{\\frac{1}{8}}{\\frac{1}{4}} = \\frac{1}{8} \\times 4 = \\frac{4}{8} = \\frac{1}{2}.\n     \\]\n\n2. **Substitute back into the equation**:\n   - The original equation now becomes:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{a} = 1.\n     \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\(\\frac{1}{a}\\)**:\n   - Subtract \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) from both sides:\n     \\[\n     -\\frac{1}{a} = 1 - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}.\n     \\]\n   - Multiply both sides by \\(-1\\):\n     \\[\n     \\frac{1}{a} = -\\frac{1}{2}.\n     \\]\n\n4. **Find \\(a\\) by taking reciprocals**:\n   - If \\(\\frac{1}{a} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\), then:\n     \\[\n     a = -2.\n     \\]\n\n5. **Verify the solution**:\n   - Substitute \\(a = -2\\) back into the original equation:\n     \\[\n     \\dfrac{8^{-1}}{4^{-1}} - (-2)^{-1} = \\frac{1}{2} - \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 1.\n     \\]\n   - The left-hand side equals the right-hand side, confirming \\(a = -2\\) is correct.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  Inv \u2115\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  Inv \u2115\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  DivInvMonoid \u2115\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  DivInvMonoid \u2115\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nsimp made no progress\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  8\u207b\u00b9 / 4\u207b\u00b9\ncase refine_3\na : \u211d\nh\u2080 : a \u2260 0\nh\u2081 : 8\u207b\u00b9 / 4\u207b\u00b9 - a\u207b\u00b9 = 1\nh\u2082 : 8\u207b\u00b9 / 4\u207b\u00b9 = 1 / 2\n\u22a2 a = -2\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  Inv \u2115\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  Inv \u2115\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  DivInvMonoid \u2115\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  DivInvMonoid \u2115\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nsimp made no progress\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  8\u207b\u00b9 / 4\u207b\u00b9\ncase refine_3\na : \u211d\nh\u2080 : a \u2260 0\nh\u2081 : 8\u207b\u00b9 / 4\u207b\u00b9 - a\u207b\u00b9 = 1\nh\u2082 : 8\u207b\u00b9 / 4\u207b\u00b9 = 1 / 2\n\u22a2 a = -2\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  Inv \u2115\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  Inv \u2115\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  DivInvMonoid \u2115\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  DivInvMonoid \u2115\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nsimp made no progress\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  8\u207b\u00b9 / 4\u207b\u00b9\ncase refine_3\na : \u211d\nh\u2080 : a \u2260 0\nh\u2081 : 8\u207b\u00b9 / 4\u207b\u00b9 - a\u207b\u00b9 = 1\nh\u2082 : 8\u207b\u00b9 / 4\u207b\u00b9 = 1 / 2\n\u22a2 a = -2\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, we have a complex number z that satisfies the equation 12|z|\u00b2 = 2|z + 2|\u00b2 + |z\u00b2 + 1|\u00b2 + 31. We need to find the value of z + 6/z, and the answer is supposed to be -2. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that for complex numbers, the modulus squared can be expressed using conjugates. Specifically, |a|\u00b2 = a * conjugate(a). Maybe expanding the terms on the right-hand side using this property will help simplify the equation.\n\nLet me write down the given equation again:\n\n12|z|\u00b2 = 2|z + 2|\u00b2 + |z\u00b2 + 1|\u00b2 + 31.\n\nLet's start by expanding each modulus squared term. Starting with |z + 2|\u00b2. Using the formula |a + b|\u00b2 = (a + b)(\\overline{a} + \\overline{b}) = |a|\u00b2 + a\\overline{b} + \\overline{a}b + |b|\u00b2. Here, a is z and b is 2. Since 2 is real, its conjugate is itself. So:\n\n|z + 2|\u00b2 = |z|\u00b2 + z*2 + \\overline{z}*2 + 4.\n\nSimplifying that, it's |z|\u00b2 + 2(z + \\overline{z}) + 4. But z + \\overline{z} is 2 Re(z), which is twice the real part of z. But maybe we can keep it as z + \\overline{z} for now.\n\nSo, 2|z + 2|\u00b2 becomes 2(|z|\u00b2 + 2(z + \\overline{z}) + 4) = 2|z|\u00b2 + 4(z + \\overline{z}) + 8.\n\nNext, the term |z\u00b2 + 1|\u00b2. Similarly, this is (z\u00b2 + 1)(\\overline{z\u00b2} + 1). Let's expand that:\n\nz\u00b2 * \\overline{z\u00b2} + z\u00b2 * 1 + 1 * \\overline{z\u00b2} + 1*1.\n\nBut z\u00b2 * \\overline{z\u00b2} is |z\u00b2|\u00b2 = |z|\u2074. Then, z\u00b2 + \\overline{z\u00b2} is 2 Re(z\u00b2), but again, maybe we can leave it as z\u00b2 + \\overline{z\u00b2} for now. So:\n\n|z\u00b2 + 1|\u00b2 = |z|\u2074 + z\u00b2 + \\overline{z\u00b2} + 1.\n\nPutting this back into the original equation:\n\n12|z|\u00b2 = 2|z|\u00b2 + 4(z + \\overline{z}) + 8 + |z|\u2074 + z\u00b2 + \\overline{z\u00b2} + 1 + 31.\n\nSimplify the constants: 8 + 1 + 31 = 40. So:\n\n12|z|\u00b2 = 2|z|\u00b2 + 4(z + \\overline{z}) + |z|\u2074 + z\u00b2 + \\overline{z\u00b2} + 40.\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n12|z|\u00b2 - 2|z|\u00b2 - |z|\u2074 - z\u00b2 - \\overline{z\u00b2} - 4(z + \\overline{z}) - 40 = 0.\n\nSimplify 12|z|\u00b2 - 2|z|\u00b2 = 10|z|\u00b2. So:\n\n10|z|\u00b2 - |z|\u2074 - z\u00b2 - \\overline{z\u00b2} - 4(z + \\overline{z}) - 40 = 0.\n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Maybe there's a substitution we can make. Let's let |z|\u00b2 = x. Since |z|\u00b2 is a real number, x is real and non-negative. Also, note that z \\overline{z} = |z|\u00b2 = x. So, maybe express other terms in terms of x.\n\nBut we also have terms like z + \\overline{z} and z\u00b2 + \\overline{z\u00b2}. Let's denote Re(z) = a and Im(z) = b, so z = a + bi. Then, |z|\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = x. Then, z + \\overline{z} = 2a, and z\u00b2 + \\overline{z\u00b2} = (a + bi)\u00b2 + (a - bi)\u00b2 = (a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 + 2abi) + (a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 - 2abi) = 2a\u00b2 - 2b\u00b2. So, z\u00b2 + \\overline{z\u00b2} = 2(a\u00b2 - b\u00b2). But since x = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2, then a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = x - 2b\u00b2. Hmm, not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe express z + 6/z. Let's denote w = z + 6/z. The problem asks for the value of w. Maybe if we can express the given equation in terms of w, we can find its value.\n\nLet me try that. Let's compute z + 6/z. Let's denote w = z + 6/z. Then, multiplying both sides by z, we get wz = z\u00b2 + 6. So, z\u00b2 = wz - 6. Maybe substituting z\u00b2 into the original equation.\n\nBut the original equation has |z\u00b2 + 1|\u00b2. Let's see. If z\u00b2 = wz - 6, then z\u00b2 + 1 = wz - 5. So |z\u00b2 + 1|\u00b2 = |wz - 5|\u00b2. Hmm, but this might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe express |z\u00b2 + 1|\u00b2 in terms of |z|\u00b2 and other terms.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that |z\u00b2 + 1|\u00b2 = |z\u00b2 + 1|\u00b2 = (z\u00b2 + 1)(\\overline{z\u00b2} + 1) = |z\u00b2|\u00b2 + z\u00b2 + \\overline{z\u00b2} + 1. Which is |z|\u2074 + z\u00b2 + \\overline{z\u00b2} + 1. Which we already used earlier.\n\nSo, going back to the equation:\n\n10|z|\u00b2 - |z|\u2074 - z\u00b2 - \\overline{z\u00b2} - 4(z + \\overline{z}) - 40 = 0.\n\nLet me substitute x = |z|\u00b2. Then, the equation becomes:\n\n10x - x\u00b2 - (z\u00b2 + \\overline{z\u00b2}) - 4(z + \\overline{z}) - 40 = 0.\n\nBut z + \\overline{z} = 2a (if z = a + bi), and z\u00b2 + \\overline{z\u00b2} = 2(a\u00b2 - b\u00b2). Also, since x = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2, then a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = x - 2b\u00b2. But maybe this is getting too involved. Alternatively, perhaps assume that z is a real number. If z is real, then the equation might simplify. Let's check if that's possible.\n\nIf z is real, then \\overline{z} = z, so all the terms become real. Let's suppose z is real. Then, the equation becomes:\n\n12z\u00b2 = 2(z + 2)\u00b2 + (z\u00b2 + 1)\u00b2 + 31.\n\nLet's compute each term:\n\n2(z + 2)\u00b2 = 2(z\u00b2 + 4z + 4) = 2z\u00b2 + 8z + 8.\n\n(z\u00b2 + 1)\u00b2 = z\u2074 + 2z\u00b2 + 1.\n\nSo, substituting into the equation:\n\n12z\u00b2 = 2z\u00b2 + 8z + 8 + z\u2074 + 2z\u00b2 + 1 + 31.\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n2z\u00b2 + 8z + 8 + z\u2074 + 2z\u00b2 + 1 + 31 = z\u2074 + 4z\u00b2 + 8z + 40.\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\n12z\u00b2 = z\u2074 + 4z\u00b2 + 8z + 40.\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n0 = z\u2074 + 4z\u00b2 + 8z + 40 - 12z\u00b2\n\nSimplify:\n\nz\u2074 - 8z\u00b2 + 8z + 40 = 0.\n\nHmm, quartic equation. Let's see if this factors or has real roots. Let's try plugging in possible integer roots. Possible rational roots are factors of 40 over 1: \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b14, \u00b15, \u00b18, \u00b110, \u00b120, \u00b140.\n\nTest z = -2:\n\n(-2)^4 -8*(-2)^2 +8*(-2) +40 = 16 - 32 -16 +40 = 8. Not zero.\n\nz = -1:\n\n1 -8 + (-8) +40 = 25. Not zero.\n\nz = 2:\n\n16 -32 +16 +40 = 40. Not zero.\n\nz = 4:\n\n256 - 128 +32 +40 = 200. Not zero.\n\nHmm, maybe no real roots. So perhaps z is not real. Then, assuming z is real might not work. So maybe z is complex but not real. But this complicates things. Alternatively, maybe there's a substitution we can make.\n\nWait, the problem asks for z + 6/z. Let's denote w = z + 6/z. Then, perhaps we can express the given equation in terms of w.\n\nFirst, let's compute |z + 2|\u00b2. If z is complex, then |z + 2|\u00b2 = (z + 2)(\\overline{z} + 2) = |z|\u00b2 + 2z + 2\\overline{z} +4.\n\nSimilarly, |z\u00b2 +1|\u00b2 = (z\u00b2 +1)(\\overline{z}^2 +1) = |z|^4 + z\u00b2 + \\overline{z}^2 +1.\n\nSo, substituting back into the original equation:\n\n12|z|\u00b2 = 2(|z|\u00b2 + 2z + 2\\overline{z} +4) + |z|^4 + z\u00b2 + \\overline{z}^2 +1 +31.\n\nSimplify:\n\n12|z|\u00b2 = 2|z|\u00b2 +4z +4\\overline{z} +8 + |z|^4 + z\u00b2 + \\overline{z}^2 +1 +31.\n\nCombine constants: 8 +1 +31 =40.\n\nSo:\n\n12|z|\u00b2 = 2|z|\u00b2 +4(z + \\overline{z}) + |z|^4 + z\u00b2 + \\overline{z}^2 +40.\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n12|z|\u00b2 -2|z|\u00b2 - |z|^4 - z\u00b2 - \\overline{z}^2 -4(z + \\overline{z}) -40 =0.\n\nSimplify:\n\n10|z|\u00b2 - |z|^4 - z\u00b2 - \\overline{z}^2 -4(z + \\overline{z}) -40 =0.\n\nLet me denote x = |z|\u00b2. Also, let me note that z + \\overline{z} = 2 Re(z) = 2a (if z = a + bi). Similarly, z\u00b2 + \\overline{z}^2 = (a + bi)^2 + (a - bi)^2 = 2a\u00b2 - 2b\u00b2. But since x = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2, then z\u00b2 + \\overline{z}^2 = 2(a\u00b2 - b\u00b2) = 2(2a\u00b2 - x). Wait, because x = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2, so a\u00b2 = x - b\u00b2. Hmm, maybe not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, note that z\u00b2 + \\overline{z}^2 = (z + \\overline{z})\u00b2 - 2|z|\u00b2. Because (z + \\overline{z})\u00b2 = z\u00b2 + 2z\\overline{z} + \\overline{z}^2 = z\u00b2 + 2|z|\u00b2 + \\overline{z}^2. Therefore, z\u00b2 + \\overline{z}^2 = (z + \\overline{z})\u00b2 - 2|z|\u00b2.\n\nLet me use that. Let\u2019s set S = z + \\overline{z} = 2 Re(z). Then, z\u00b2 + \\overline{z}^2 = S\u00b2 - 2x.\n\nSubstituting into the equation:\n\n10x - x\u00b2 - (S\u00b2 - 2x) -4S -40 =0.\n\nSimplify:\n\n10x -x\u00b2 -S\u00b2 +2x -4S -40 =0.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(10x +2x) -x\u00b2 -S\u00b2 -4S -40 =0 \u2192 12x -x\u00b2 -S\u00b2 -4S -40=0.\n\nRearranged:\n\n-x\u00b2 +12x -S\u00b2 -4S -40=0.\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\nx\u00b2 -12x + S\u00b2 +4S +40=0.\n\nHmm, not sure if this helps. Let's see. We need to relate S and x. Remember that S = z + \\overline{z} = 2 Re(z), and x = |z|\u00b2 = (Re(z))\u00b2 + (Im(z))\u00b2. Let\u2019s denote a = Re(z), b = Im(z). Then, S = 2a, x = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2. So, S\u00b2 =4a\u00b2. Then, S\u00b2 =4a\u00b2 =4(x - b\u00b2). But unless we know b, this might not help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe express everything in terms of S and x. Let's try:\n\nFrom x = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 and S = 2a, so a = S/2. Then, x = (S/2)^2 + b\u00b2 \u2192 b\u00b2 = x - S\u00b2/4.\n\nBut then, substituting back into the equation:\n\nx\u00b2 -12x + S\u00b2 +4S +40=0.\n\nBut we also have b\u00b2 = x - S\u00b2/4. Since b\u00b2 must be non-negative, x - S\u00b2/4 \u22650 \u2192 S\u00b2 \u22644x.\n\nBut I'm not sure if this helps. Let's think differently. The problem asks for z +6/z. Let's denote w = z +6/z. Let's express w in terms of S and x.\n\nFirst, z +6/z. Let's compute this:\n\nw = z +6/z = z +6/z.\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by \\overline{z} to express 6/z:\n\n6/z =6 \\overline{z}/|z|\u00b2 =6 \\overline{z}/x.\n\nSo, w = z +6 \\overline{z}/x.\n\nBut z +6 \\overline{z}/x. Let's write this as:\n\nw = z + (6/x)\\overline{z}.\n\nBut z + \\overline{z} = S =2a, and z - \\overline{z} =2bi. So, maybe express w in terms of S and x.\n\nAlternatively, take the real and imaginary parts. Let's suppose that w is real. Because the answer is one of the options, which are all real numbers. So, maybe w is real. If w is real, then the imaginary part must be zero.\n\nLet\u2019s compute w = z +6/z. Let\u2019s write z = a + bi. Then, 1/z = (a - bi)/(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) = (a - bi)/x. So, 6/z =6(a - bi)/x. Therefore, w = (a + bi) +6(a - bi)/x = [a +6a/x] + [b -6b/x]i.\n\nFor w to be real, the imaginary part must be zero:\n\nb -6b/x =0 \u2192 b(1 -6/x)=0.\n\nSo either b=0 or x=6.\n\nIf b=0, then z is real. Earlier, when we assumed z is real, we ended up with a quartic equation that didn't have real roots. So maybe z is not real, hence b\u22600, so 1 -6/x=0 \u2192 x=6.\n\nSo, if w is real, then x=6. Let's check this possibility.\n\nIf x=6, then |z|\u00b2=6. Let's substitute x=6 into the equation we had earlier:\n\nx\u00b2 -12x + S\u00b2 +4S +40=0 \u2192 36 -72 + S\u00b2 +4S +40=0 \u2192 (36-72+40) + S\u00b2 +4S=0 \u2192 4 + S\u00b2 +4S=0 \u2192 S\u00b2 +4S +4=0 \u2192 (S+2)^2=0 \u2192 S= -2.\n\nSo, S= -2. Since S=2a, this implies a= -1. So, Re(z)= -1.\n\nSo, if x=6 and a= -1, then b\u00b2 =x -a\u00b2=6 -1=5. So, b=\u00b1\u221a5. Therefore, z= -1 \u00b1\u221a5 i.\n\nNow, compute w= z +6/z. Let's compute 6/z. Since z= -1 +\u221a5 i, then 1/z= \\overline{z}/|z|\u00b2= (-1 -\u221a5 i)/6. So, 6/z= (-1 -\u221a5 i). Therefore, w= z +6/z= (-1 +\u221a5 i) + (-1 -\u221a5 i)= -2. Similarly, if z= -1 -\u221a5 i, then 6/z= (-1 +\u221a5 i), so w= (-1 -\u221a5 i) + (-1 +\u221a5 i)= -2. So, in either case, w= -2. Which matches option A.\n\nBut we need to verify that x=6 and S=-2 satisfy the original equation. Let's check.\n\nFrom earlier steps, when we substituted x=6 and S=-2 into the equation x\u00b2 -12x + S\u00b2 +4S +40=0, we got 36 -72 +4 + (-8) +40=0 \u2192 36-72= -36; -36+4= -32; -32-8= -40; -40+40=0. So, yes, it satisfies.\n\nTherefore, the value of z +6/z is -2.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nLet's start by analyzing the given equation: \\(12|z|^2 = 2|z+2|^2 + |z^2+1|^2 + 31\\). Our goal is to find \\(z + \\frac{6}{z}\\). \n\n**Step 1: Expand modulus terms**  \nFirst, expand the modulus terms using properties of complex conjugates.

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to evaluate log base 3 of 27 and show that it's equal to 3. Let me think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst, I remember that a logarithm log_b(a) asks the question: \"To what power should we raise the base b to get a?\" So in this case, log_3(27) is asking, \"3 raised to what power gives 27?\" If I can find that exponent, that's the value of the logarithm.\n\nHmm, 3 multiplied by itself a few times. Let's see: 3^1 is 3, 3^2 is 9, 3^3 is 27. Oh, right! 3 cubed is 27. So that means 3^3 = 27. Therefore, the exponent needed is 3. So log_3(27) must be 3. \n\nWait, but maybe I should check if there's another way to approach this, just to be thorough. Like, using the definition of logarithms. The logarithm log_b(a) = c means that b^c = a. Applying that here, if log_3(27) = c, then 3^c = 27. Since 3^3 = 27, c is 3. That confirms it again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe express 27 as a power of 3. Since 27 is 3^3, substituting that into the logarithm gives log_3(3^3). Then, using the logarithm power rule, log_b(b^k) = k. So that simplifies directly to 3. \n\nI think that covers it. There's not much more to it because 27 is an exact power of 3. So all methods point to the answer being 3. No need for complicated steps here. Just understanding the definition of logarithms and recognizing the exponent.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo evaluate \\(\\log_3 27\\), we need to determine the exponent that we must raise 3 to in order to get 27. By definition, \\(\\log_b a = c\\) means \\(b^c = a\\). Here, \\(b = 3\\) and \\(a = 27\\), so we seek \\(c\\) such that \\(3^c = 27\\).\n\nObserve that \\(3^1 = 3\\), \\(3^2 = 9\\), and \\(3^3 = 27\\). This progression shows that \\(3^3 = 27\\), meaning the exponent \\(c\\) that satisfies the equation is \\(3\\). Therefore, \\(\\log_3 27 = 3\\).\n\nTo confirm, we can rewrite \\(27\\) as \\(3^3\\) and apply the logarithmic identity \\(\\log_b (b^k) = k\\). Substituting, \\(\\log_3 (3^3) = 3\\), which directly gives the result. This aligns with both the definition of logarithms and basic exponent rules, verifying that the value of \\(\\log_3 27\\) is indeed \\(3\\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown tactic\nunknown constant 'Real.log'\nunknown constant 'Real.log'\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown tactic\nunknown constant 'Real.log'\nunknown constant 'Real.log'\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown tactic\nunknown constant 'Real.log'\nunknown constant 'Real.log'\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the remainder when 1529 is divided by 6, and show that it's 5. Let me start by recalling what the modulo operation means. From the context given, the modulo operation, written as x mod y, is defined as x minus y multiplied by the floor of x divided by y. The floor function here means taking the greatest integer less than or equal to the division result.\n\nSo, applying that definition to 1529 mod 6. Let's break it down step by step. First, I need to divide 1529 by 6. Let me do that division. Hmm, 6 times 250 is 1500, right? Because 6*200=1200, 6*50=300, so 1200+300=1500. Then 1529 minus 1500 is 29. So 6*254 would be 6*(250+4)=1500+24=1524. Wait, 6*254=1524. Then 1529-1524=5. So the remainder is 5. But let me make sure I follow the formula properly.\n\nAccording to the formula, x mod y = x - y*floor(x/y). So x is 1529, y is 6. First, compute x/y: 1529 divided by 6. Let me calculate that. 6*250=1500, as before. 1529-1500=29. Now, 29 divided by 6 is 4 with a remainder of 5, because 6*4=24, 29-24=5. So 1529/6 is 254 with a remainder of 5. Wait, but how does that translate into the floor function?\n\nWait, 1529 divided by 6 is 254.8333... So the floor of that would be 254. Then, according to the formula, 1529 mod 6 = 1529 - 6*254. Let me compute 6*254. 6*250=1500, 6*4=24, so 1500+24=1524. Then 1529 - 1524 = 5. So that gives the remainder as 5. That matches the earlier calculation. So the remainder is indeed 5.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a quicker way by breaking down 1529 into parts that are easier to handle modulo 6. For example, since 1529 is 1500 + 29. 1500 divided by 6 is 250, so 1500 mod 6 is 0. Then 29 mod 6. Let's compute 29 divided by 6. 6*4=24, remainder 5. So 29 mod 6 is 5. Then adding the two remainders: 0 + 5 = 5. So 1529 mod 6 is 5. That's another way to check it.\n\nAlternatively, using the divisibility rules for 6. A number is divisible by 6 if it's divisible by both 2 and 3. But since we're looking for the remainder, maybe that's not directly helpful here. But breaking down the number into digits: 1+5+2+9 = 17. Wait, but that's the sum of digits for divisibility by 3. 17 mod 3 is 2, so 1529 mod 3 would be 2. But since we're dealing with mod 6, maybe combining mod 2 and mod 3. But perhaps that's complicating things. The direct division method seems straightforward.\n\nAnother approach: 1529 divided by 6. Let's see, 6*200=1200, subtract that from 1529: 1529-1200=329. Then 6*50=300, subtract that: 329-300=29. Then 6*4=24, subtract that: 29-24=5. So total multiples are 200+50+4=254, remainder 5. So again, remainder 5.\n\nSo all methods point to the remainder being 5. Therefore, 1529 mod 6 is indeed 5.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo determine the remainder of 1529 when divided by 6 (i.e., \\(1529 \\bmod 6\\)), we use the definition of the modulo operation:  \n\\[\nx \\bmod y = x - y \\left\\lfloor \\frac{x}{y} \\right\\rfloor,\n\\]  \nwhere \\(\\lfloor \\cdot \\rfloor\\) denotes the floor function (the greatest integer less than or equal to the input).  \n\n**Step 1: Compute \\(\\frac{1529}{6}\\).**  \nDivide 1529 by 6:  \n- \\(6 \\times 250 = 1500\\), leaving \\(1529 - 1500 = 29\\).  \n- \\(6 \\times 4 = 24\\), leaving \\(29 - 24 = 5\\).  \n\nThus, \\(1529 = 6 \\times 254 + 5\\), where \\(254\\) is the integer quotient.  \n\n**Step 2: Apply the floor function.**  \nThe division result is \\(1529/6 = 254.833\\ldots\\), so \\(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{1529}{6} \\right\\rfloor = 254\\).  \n\n**Step 3: Calculate \\(1529 \\bmod 6\\).**  \nSubstitute into the formula:  \n\\[\n1529 \\bmod 6 = 1529 - 6 \\times 254 = 1529 - 1524 = 5.\n\\]  \n\n**Verification:**  \nBreaking \\(1529\\) into \\(1500 + 29\\):  \n- \\(1500 \\div 6 = 250\\) (no remainder).  \n- \\(29 \\div 6 = 4\\) with remainder \\(5\\).  \n\nAdding the remainders: \\(0 + 5 = 5\\).  \n\nThus, the remainder when \\(1529\\) is divided by \\(6\\) is indeed \\(5\\).",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to compute 91 squared in my head and show that it's 8281. Hmm, let's see. I remember that squaring numbers close to 100 can sometimes be done with a trick, but I'm not sure exactly how. Let me think about the example given in the context with 12 and 21. They expanded (10 + 2)^2 and (20 + 1)^2 using the formula (a + b)^2 = a\u00b2 + 2ab + b\u00b2. Maybe I can use a similar approach here.\n\nWait, 91 is close to 100. Maybe I can express 91 as 100 minus 9. Let's try that. So, 91 = 100 - 9. Then, squaring that would be (100 - 9)^2. Using the formula (a - b)^2 = a\u00b2 - 2ab + b\u00b2. Let's apply that.\n\nSo, (100 - 9)^2 = 100\u00b2 - 2*100*9 + 9\u00b2. Calculating each term: 100 squared is 10,000. Then 2 times 100 times 9 is 2*900 = 1800. And 9 squared is 81. So putting it all together: 10,000 - 1,800 + 81. \n\nWait, 10,000 minus 1,800 is 8,200. Then adding 81 gives 8,200 + 81 = 8,281. That matches the answer we need, 8281. So that works!\n\nBut maybe there's another way to check. Let me try expanding 91 as (90 + 1). Then (90 + 1)^2 = 90\u00b2 + 2*90*1 + 1\u00b2. 90 squared is 8,100. 2*90*1 is 180. 1 squared is 1. Adding those: 8,100 + 180 = 8,280, plus 1 is 8,281. Same result. So both methods give the same answer. That's reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the difference of squares formula? Not sure. But the two methods I tried both lead to 8281. So I think that's correct. Let me just verify with another approach. Maybe multiplying 91 by 91 directly. Let's see:\n\n91 times 91. Break it down as 90*90 + 90*1 + 1*90 + 1*1. Wait, that's (90+1)(90+1) which is the same as the expansion before. So 90*90 is 8100, 90*1 is 90, 1*90 is another 90, and 1*1 is 1. Adding those: 8100 + 90 + 90 + 1 = 8100 + 180 +1 = 8281. Yep, same answer. Okay, so all methods confirm that 91 squared is 8281. I think that's solid.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo compute \\(91^2\\) mentally, we can use the algebraic identity for squaring a binomial. Let's express 91 as \\(90 + 1\\).

We need to find the parities (even or odd) of D2021, D2022, and D2023. The answer is supposed to be (E, O, E), which is option C. Let me see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, since we're dealing with parities, maybe looking at the sequence modulo 2 would help. That way, even numbers become 0 and odd numbers become 1. This simplifies the recurrence relation because addition modulo 2 is just XOR (if the sum is even, it's 0; if odd, 1).\n\nSo let's start by writing out the initial terms of the sequence modulo 2. Let's compute D0 to, say, D10 or so to see if there's a repeating pattern.

Let's see:\n\nLooking at the parities up to n=29, let's list them:\n\n0: E\n1: E\n2: O\n3: O\n4: O\n5: E\n6: O\n7: E\n8: E\n9: O\n10: O\n11: O\n12: E\n13: O\n14: E\n15: E\n16: O\n17: O\n18: O\n19: E\n20: O\n21: E\n22: E\n23: O\n24: O\n25: O\n26: E\n27: O\n28: E\n29: E\n\nLooking for when the initial sequence E, E, O, O, O, E, O, E, E, O, ... repeats. Let's check if after some point, the parities repeat from the start.\n\nLooking at n=0-2: E, E, O\n\nCompare with n=8-10: E, E, O (D8=E, D9=O, D10=O? Wait D8 is E, D9 is O, D10 is O. So (E, O, O). Not the same as initial.\n\nWait, maybe check n=12-14: E, O, E. Not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the cycle starts at n=6. Let's check n=6-8: O, E, E. Not the same as initial.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cycle length is 8. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the parities from n=0 to n=7:\n\nE, E, O, O, O, E, O, E\n\nThen n=8 to n=15: E, O, O, O, E, O, E, E\n\nHmm, not obvious. Maybe the cycle is longer. Let's check from n=16 onwards:\n\nn=16: O\n\nn=17: O\n\nn=18: O\n\nn=19: E\n\nn=20: O\n\nn=21: E\n\nn=22: E\n\nn=23: O\n\nn=24: O\n\nn=25: O\n\nn=26: E\n\nn=27: O\n\nn=28: E\n\nn=29: E\n\nCompare this with the earlier terms. Let's see if from n=16 onwards, the parities repeat the same as from n=0:\n\nn=0: E, E, O, O, O, E, O, E, E, O, O, O, E, O, E, E\n\nn=16: O, O, O, E, O, E, E, O, O, O, E, O, E, E,...\n\nNot the same. So maybe the cycle isn't 16. Alternatively, perhaps the cycle is 14? Let's check:\n\nFrom n=0 to n=13: E, E, O, O, O, E, O, E, E, O, O, O, E, O\n\nn=14: E\n\nn=15: E\n\nn=16: O\n\nn=17: O\n\nn=18: O\n\nn=19: E\n\nn=20: O\n\nn=21: E\n\nn=22: E\n\nn=23: O\n\nn=24: O\n\nn=25: O\n\nn=26: E\n\nn=27: O\n\nn=28: E\n\nn=29: E\n\nHmm, not obvious. Alternatively, maybe the cycle is 7. Let's check:\n\nLooking at n=0-6: E, E, O, O, O, E, O\n\nn=7-13: E, E, O, O, O, E, O\n\nWait, n=7: E, n=8: E, n=9: O, n=10: O, n=11: O, n=12: E, n=13: O. So from n=7 to n=13: E, E, O, O, O, E, O. Which is similar to the initial sequence starting at n=0: E, E, O, O, O, E, O. So if we shift by 7, maybe the cycle is 7? Let's check further.\n\nn=14: E (n=14), n=15: E, n=16: O, n=17: O, n=18: O, n=19: E, n=20: O. So from n=14 to n=20: E, E, O, O, O, E, O. Which is the same as n=0-6. So this suggests that starting from n=7, the sequence repeats every 7 terms. Wait, but n=7 is E, n=14 is E, n=21 is E, etc. So maybe the cycle is 7. Let's check:\n\nIf the cycle is 7, then the parities repeat every 7 terms. Let's see:\n\nFrom n=0-6: E, E, O, O, O, E, O\n\nn=7-13: E, E, O, O, O, E, O (matches n=0-6)\n\nn=14-20: E, E, O, O, O, E, O (same pattern)\n\nn=21-27: E, E, O, O, O, E, O? Wait, n=21 is E, n=22 is E, n=23 is O, n=24 is O, n=25 is O, n=26 is E, n=27 is O. Yes, that's the same.\n\nSimilarly, n=28-34: E, E, O, O, O, E, O. Wait, n=28 is E, n=29 is E, n=30 would be O (if following the cycle). But wait, let's check the actual computed terms:\n\nWait, up to n=29, we have:\n\nn=28: E\n\nn=29: E\n\nBut according to the cycle, after n=27 (O), n=28 should be E (which it is), n=29 should be E (which it is), then n=30 would be O, etc. But let's check if this holds. Let's compute D30:\n\nD30 = D29 + D27. D29 is 0 (E), D27 is 1 (O). So D30 = 0 + 1 = 1 mod 2 \u2192 O. Which matches the cycle. Then D31 = D30 + D28 = 1 + 0 = 1 mod 2 \u2192 O. D32 = D31 + D29 = 1 + 0 = 1 mod 2 \u2192 O. D33 = D32 + D30 = 1 + 1 = 0 mod 2 \u2192 E. D34 = D33 + D31 = 0 + 1 = 1 mod 2 \u2192 O. So the sequence from n=28 to n=34 would be E, E, O, O, O, E, O. Which is the same as the cycle. So yes, the cycle seems to repeat every 7 terms starting from n=0.\n\nWait, but wait, the initial terms from n=0-6 are E, E, O, O, O, E, O. Then n=7-13: E, E, O, O, O, E, O. So the cycle is indeed 7 terms long. Therefore, the parity sequence has a period of 7.\n\nTherefore, the parities repeat every 7 terms. So to find D2021, D2022, D2023, we can compute 2021 mod 7, 2022 mod 7, and 2023 mod 7 to find their positions in the cycle.\n\nFirst, let's compute 2021 divided by 7. Let's find 7*288=2016. So 2021=7*288 + 5. Therefore, 2021 mod 7 is 5. Similarly, 2022=2021+1=5+1=6 mod 7. 2023=6+1=0 mod 7.\n\nWait, 2023 mod 7: 2023 - 7*288=2023-2016=7, so 7 mod7=0. So 2023 mod7=0.\n\nNow, the cycle is 7 terms starting at n=0:\n\nn mod7 | Parity\n0 | E\n1 | E\n2 | O\n3 | O\n4 | O\n5 | E\n6 | O\n\nSo:\n\nD_{2021} corresponds to n=2021 mod7=5 \u2192 parity E (since n=5 is E)\nD_{2022} mod7=6 \u2192 parity O (n=6 is O)\nD_{2023} mod7=0 \u2192 parity E (n=0 is E)\n\nTherefore, the triple is (E, O, E), which is option C.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check the cycle. The cycle from n=0 to n=6 is:\n\nn | Dn | Parity\n0 | 0 | E\n1 | 0 | E\n2 | 1 | O\n3 | 1 | O\n4 | 1 | O\n5 | 0 | E\n6 | 1 | O\n\nSo yes, n=5 is E, n=6 is O, n=0 is E. Therefore, D2021 (mod7=5) is E, D2022 (mod7=6) is O, D2023 (mod7=0) is E. So (E, O, E), which is option C. That matches the answer given.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo determine the parities of \\(D_{2021}\\), \\(D_{2022}\\), and \\(D_{2023}\\), we analyze the sequence modulo 2 (where even numbers are 0 and odd numbers are 1).

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to show that for any positive natural number n, the nth root of n is less than or equal to 2 minus 1/n. So, n^(1/n) \u2264 2 - 1/n. Hmm. Let's start by understanding what this inequality is saying. For each n, take the nth root of n and compare it to 2 minus the reciprocal of n. \n\nFirst, maybe check some small values of n to see if it holds. Let's try n=1: 1^(1/1)=1, and 2 - 1/1=1. So equality holds here. For n=2: 2^(1/2)=\u221a2 \u22481.414, and 2 -1/2=1.5. So 1.414 \u22641.5, which is true. For n=3: 3^(1/3)\u22481.442, and 2 -1/3\u22481.666. Still holds. n=4: 4^(1/4)=\u221a2\u22481.414, 2 -1/4=1.75. Okay, seems to work. So the inequality holds for these small n. But we need to prove it for all positive natural numbers.\n\nLooking at the context provided, there's a proof that the limit of n^(1/n) as n approaches infinity is 1. The approach there was to set n^(1/n) =1 +a_n and then bound a_n. Maybe a similar strategy can be used here. Let's see. If I set n^(1/n) =1 +a_n, then the goal is to show that 1 +a_n \u22642 -1/n, which simplifies to a_n \u22641 -1/n. But wait, for n=1, a_n would be 0, which fits. For n=2, a_n=\u221a2 -1\u22480.414, and 1 -1/2=0.5, so 0.414 \u22640.5. That works. So maybe if I can show that a_n \u22641 -1/n, that would do it. But how?\n\nIn the context's proof, they expanded (1 +a_n)^n using the binomial theorem and then derived an inequality involving a_n^2. Let me recall that. They had n = (1 +a_n)^n \u2265 1 +n a_n + [n(n-1)/2]a_n^2. Then they subtracted 1 to get n-1 \u2265n a_n + [n(n-1)/2]a_n^2. But in their step (2), they wrote n-1 \u2265 [n(n-1)/2]a_n^2, which seems like they dropped the n a_n term. That's probably because a_n is positive, so dropping the n a_n term makes the inequality still hold. Then from that, they deduced that a_n^2 \u22642/n. So maybe similar steps can be applied here.\n\nBut our goal is different. We need to show that 1 +a_n \u22642 -1/n. Let's rearrange this inequality. Subtract 1 from both sides: a_n \u22641 -1/n. So we need to show that a_n \u22641 -1/n. Alternatively, since a_n is positive (as n^(1/n) >1 for n>1), maybe we can find an upper bound for a_n.\n\nAlternatively, maybe instead of using the binomial expansion directly, we can manipulate the inequality n^(1/n) \u22642 -1/n. Let's raise both sides to the nth power. Then n \u2264 (2 -1/n)^n. Wait, but raising both sides to the nth power might complicate things because the right-hand side would be a more complicated expression. However, perhaps for n\u22651, (2 -1/n)^n is greater than or equal to n. Let's check for n=1: (2 -1/1)^1=1, which equals n=1. For n=2: (2 -1/2)^2=(1.5)^2=2.25 \u22652. For n=3: (5/3)^3\u2248125/27\u22484.63\u22653. For n=4: (7/4)^4\u2248(1.75)^4\u22489.378\u22654. So it seems to hold. So if we can show that (2 -1/n)^n \u2265n for all n\u22651, then taking the nth root would give the original inequality. But proving that (2 -1/n)^n \u2265n might be tricky. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use induction. Let's try mathematical induction. For n=1: 1^(1/1)=1 \u22642 -1/1=1. So base case holds. Assume it holds for some k\u22651, i.e., k^(1/k) \u22642 -1/k. Then need to show that (k+1)^(1/(k+1)) \u22642 -1/(k+1). But induction might be complicated here because the function n^(1/n) is decreasing for n\u22653, but the right-hand side 2 -1/n is increasing. So maybe the maximum of the left-hand side is achieved at some point, but since the inequality holds for all n, perhaps induction can work. Let's try.\n\nAssume for n=k, k^(1/k) \u22642 -1/k. Then for n=k+1, we need to show (k+1)^(1/(k+1)) \u22642 -1/(k+1). But how to relate this to the induction hypothesis? It's not straightforward. Maybe induction isn't the best approach here.\n\nGoing back to the original idea of using the binomial theorem. Let's set n^(1/n) =1 +a_n. Then n=(1 +a_n)^n. Expand the right-hand side using the binomial theorem. The expansion is 1 +n a_n + (n(n-1)/2)a_n^2 + ... +a_n^n. Since all terms are positive, we can say that n \u22651 +n a_n + (n(n-1)/2)a_n^2. Subtracting 1 gives n-1 \u2265n a_n + (n(n-1)/2)a_n^2. Since all terms are positive, we can drop the n a_n term and get n-1 \u2265 (n(n-1)/2)a_n^2. Then solving for a_n^2 gives a_n^2 \u22642/n. So a_n \u2264sqrt(2/n). But we need to show that a_n \u22641 -1/n. Wait, sqrt(2/n) \u22641 -1/n? Let's check for n=2: sqrt(2/2)=1, and 1 -1/2=0.5. But 1 \u22640.5 is false. So this approach gives a bound that's too loose. Therefore, the bound from the context's proof isn't sufficient for our current problem. So we need a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider the function f(n)=n^(1/n) and g(n)=2 -1/n. We can compare their growth rates. For n\u22651, f(n) decreases towards 1, and g(n) increases towards 2. So after some n, g(n) is larger. But we need to show that for all n\u22651, f(n) \u2264g(n). Let's check for n=1: equal. For n=2: \u221a2\u22481.414 \u22641.5. For n=3: cube root of 3\u22481.442 \u22641.666. For n=4: sqrt(2)\u22481.414 \u22641.75. For n=5: 5^(1/5)\u22481.38 \u22641.8. So it seems to hold. But how to prove it generally.\n\nAnother idea: take logarithms. Let's take natural logs of both sides. The inequality becomes (1/n) ln n \u2264 ln(2 -1/n). Let's denote h(n) = (1/n) ln n - ln(2 -1/n). We need to show that h(n) \u22640 for all n\u22651. Compute h(1)= ln1 - ln(1)=0. For n=2: (1/2)ln2 - ln(1.5)\u22480.3466 -0.4055\u2248-0.0589<0. For n=3: (1/3)ln3 - ln(5/3)\u22480.3662 -0.5108\u2248-0.1446<0. So h(n) is negative for n\u22652. Maybe we can show that h(n) is decreasing and negative. But this might require calculus, which might not be the intended approach here.\n\nAlternatively, consider the inequality n^(1/n) \u22642 -1/n. Let's rearrange it as n \u2264 (2 -1/n)^n. So we need to show that (2 -1/n)^n \u2265n for all n\u22651. Let's check for n=1: (2-1)^1=1\u22651. For n=2: (1.5)^2=2.25\u22652. For n=3: (5/3)^3\u22484.63\u22653. For n=4: (7/4)^4\u22489.378\u22654. So it holds. Now, how to prove that (2 -1/n)^n \u2265n.\n\nLet's take logarithms again: n ln(2 -1/n) \u2265 ln n. So we need to show that ln(2 -1/n) \u2265 (ln n)/n. Let's denote k(n) = ln(2 -1/n) - (ln n)/n. We need to show k(n) \u22650 for all n\u22651. For n=1: ln(1) -0=0. For n=2: ln(1.5) - (ln2)/2\u22480.4055 -0.3466\u22480.0589>0. For n=3: ln(5/3) - (ln3)/3\u22480.5108 -0.3662\u22480.1446>0. So it seems to hold. Maybe we can show that k(n) is increasing or always positive. But again, this might involve calculus.\n\nAlternatively, use induction. Let's try induction again. Assume that (2 -1/k)^k \u2265k. Then for k+1, need to show (2 -1/(k+1))^{k+1} \u2265k+1. But expanding this would require relating (2 -1/(k+1))^{k+1} to (2 -1/k)^k, which might not be straightforward. Maybe use the fact that (2 -1/(k+1))^{k+1} = (2 -1/(k+1)) * (2 -1/(k+1))^k. But I'm not sure how to proceed here.\n\nAnother approach: expand (2 -1/n)^n using the binomial theorem. Let's write 2 -1/n =1 + (1 -1/n). So (1 + (1 -1/n))^n. Then expand this as sum_{k=0}^n C(n,k) (1 -1/n)^k. But this seems complicated. Alternatively, note that 2 -1/n =1 +1 -1/n =1 + (n-1)/n. So (1 + (n-1)/n)^n. Hmm. Wait, (1 + x)^n where x=(n-1)/n. Then x approaches 1 as n increases. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, compare (2 -1/n)^n and n. For n=1, it's 1=1. For n=2, 2.25>2. For n=3, ~4.63>3. For n=4, ~9.378>4. It seems that (2 -1/n)^n grows exponentially, while n grows linearly. So for n\u22651, (2 -1/n)^n \u2265n. But how to formalize this?\n\nAlternatively, use Bernoulli's inequality. Bernoulli's inequality states that (1 +x)^r \u22651 +rx for x\u2265-1 and r\u22651. But here, we have (2 -1/n)^n = (1 +1 -1/n)^n. Let me set x=1 -1/n. Then (1 +x)^n \u22651 +n x. But x=1 -1/n, so (1 +x)=2 -1/n. Wait, no, x=1 -1/n, so (1 +x)=2 -1/n. Wait, no, if we set x=1 -1/n, then (1 +x)=2 -1/n. But Bernoulli's inequality would say that (1 +x)^n \u22651 +n x. But x=1 -1/n, so 1 +n x=1 +n(1 -1/n)=1 +n -1=n. So (2 -1/n)^n \u2265n. Exactly what we need! Therefore, by Bernoulli's inequality, (2 -1/n)^n \u22651 +n*(1 -1/n)=1 +n -1=n. Hence, (2 -1/n)^n \u2265n. Taking the nth root of both sides gives n^(1/n) \u22642 -1/n. Therefore, the inequality holds for all n\u22651.\n\nWait, that seems perfect. Let me verify this step. Bernoulli's inequality applies when x\u2265-1 and r is a non-negative integer. Here, x=1 -1/n, which is certainly \u2265-1 for n\u22651. And r=n, which is a positive integer. So applying Bernoulli's inequality gives (1 +x)^n \u22651 +n x. Here, 1 +x=2 -1/n, so (2 -1/n)^n \u22651 +n*(1 -1/n)=1 +n -1=n. Therefore, (2 -1/n)^n \u2265n. Taking the nth root of both sides (since both sides are positive) preserves the inequality, so n^(1/n) \u22642 -1/n. That's exactly what we needed to prove. So this seems like the right approach using Bernoulli's inequality. I think this works.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo show that \\( n^{1/n} \\leq 2 - \\frac{1}{n} \\) for all positive natural numbers \\( n \\), we can use **Bernoulli's Inequality**, which states that for any real number \\( x \\geq -1 \\) and integer \\( r \\geq 1 \\),  \n\\[\n(1 + x)^r \\geq 1 + rx.\n\\]\n\nHere\u2019s how we apply it:\n\n1. **Rewrite the inequality**:  \n   Start by raising both sides of \\( n^{1/n} \\leq 2 - \\frac{1}{n} \\) to the \\( n \\)-th power.

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. We have three equations involving a, b, c: a(b+c) = 152, b(c+a) = 162, and c(a+b) = 170. We need to find the value of abc. The answer choices suggest it's a multiple-choice question, and the correct answer is 720. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's note that all variables are positive real numbers. The equations given are symmetric in a way. Each equation is a product of one variable and the sum of the other two. Maybe if I add them up or manipulate them somehow, I can find expressions that lead me to abc.\n\nLet me write down the equations again:\n\n1. a(b + c) = 152\n2. b(c + a) = 162\n3. c(a + b) = 170\n\nHmm. If I denote S = a + b + c, then maybe I can express each of these equations in terms of S. Let's see:\n\nFrom equation 1: a(S - a) = 152, because b + c = S - a.\n\nSimilarly, equation 2: b(S - b) = 162, and equation 3: c(S - c) = 170.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's helpful yet. Alternatively, maybe I can multiply all three equations together. Let's try that.\n\nMultiplying left sides: a(b + c) * b(c + a) * c(a + b) = (abc)(b + c)(c + a)(a + b)\n\nRight sides: 152 * 162 * 170. Let me compute that. But wait, the left side is (abc) times (a + b)(b + c)(c + a). If I can find (a + b)(b + c)(c + a), then maybe I can solve for abc.\n\nBut how do I find (a + b)(b + c)(c + a)? Let's expand that expression. Let's compute (a + b)(b + c)(c + a). Expanding step by step:\n\nFirst, multiply (a + b)(b + c) = ab + a c + b\u00b2 + b c.\n\nThen multiply by (c + a):\n\n= (ab + ac + b\u00b2 + bc)(c + a)\n= ab*c + ab*a + ac*c + ac*a + b\u00b2*c + b\u00b2*a + bc*c + bc*a\n= abc + a\u00b2b + a c\u00b2 + a\u00b2 c + b\u00b2 c + a b\u00b2 + b c\u00b2 + a b c\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n= a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + ab\u00b2 + a c\u00b2 + b\u00b2c + b c\u00b2 + 2abc\n\nAlternatively, there's a formula for (a + b)(b + c)(c + a) which is equal to (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - abc. Let me verify that:\n\n(a + b)(b + c)(c + a) = (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - abc.\n\nYes, that's a known identity. So if I can find a + b + c and ab + bc + ca, then I can compute (a + b)(b + c)(c + a).\n\nSo let's denote S = a + b + c, P = ab + bc + ca, and Q = abc. Then (a + b)(b + c)(c + a) = S * P - Q.\n\nOur goal is to find Q = abc. So if we can find S and P, then we can compute S*P - Q, and set that equal to (152 * 162 * 170)/Q, since the product of the three original equations is (abc)(a + b)(b + c)(c + a) = Q * (S*P - Q) = 152*162*170.\n\nBut this seems a bit complicated. Let's see if there's another way.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider adding the three equations. Let's compute a(b + c) + b(c + a) + c(a + b) = 152 + 162 + 170.\n\nLeft side: a(b + c) + b(c + a) + c(a + b) = ab + ac + bc + ba + ca + cb = 2(ab + bc + ca) = 2P.\n\nRight side: 152 + 162 = 314, 314 + 170 = 484. So 2P = 484 \u2192 P = 242.\n\nSo now we know that ab + bc + ca = 242.\n\nNow, let's see if we can find S = a + b + c. If we can find S, then we can use the earlier approach.\n\nBut how? Let's think. Each of the original equations can be written as:\n\na(S - a) = 152 \u2192 aS - a\u00b2 = 152\n\nSimilarly, bS - b\u00b2 = 162\n\ncS - c\u00b2 = 170\n\nSo we have three equations:\n\n1. aS - a\u00b2 = 152\n\n2. bS - b\u00b2 = 162\n\n3. cS - c\u00b2 = 170\n\nIf we add these three equations together:\n\nS(a + b + c) - (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) = 152 + 162 + 170 = 484\n\nBut a + b + c = S, so S\u00b2 - (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) = 484.\n\nBut we also know that (a + b + c)\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2(ab + bc + ca) \u2192 S\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2P.\n\nFrom this, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = S\u00b2 - 2P = S\u00b2 - 484 (since P = 242).\n\nSubstituting back into the previous equation:\n\nS\u00b2 - (S\u00b2 - 484) = 484 \u2192 S\u00b2 - S\u00b2 + 484 = 484 \u2192 484 = 484. Hmm, that's a tautology. So this approach doesn't help us find S. We need another way.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the three equations:\n\nFrom equation 1: a = 152 / (b + c)\n\nFrom equation 2: b = 162 / (c + a)\n\nFrom equation 3: c = 170 / (a + b)\n\nBut substituting these into each other might get messy. Let's see if we can express each variable in terms of the others and substitute.\n\nAlternatively, let's denote x = a + b + c, y = ab + bc + ca = 242, z = abc.\n\nWe need to find z. We know that (a + b)(b + c)(c + a) = (x)(y) - z.\n\nBut from the product of the original equations:\n\na(b + c) * b(c + a) * c(a + b) = 152 * 162 * 170 = (abc) * (a + b)(b + c)(c + a) = z * (x y - z)\n\nSo:\n\nz (x y - z) = 152 * 162 * 170\n\nBut we need to compute 152 * 162 * 170. Let's compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, 152 * 162:\n\n152 * 160 = 24,320\n\n152 * 2 = 304\n\nTotal: 24,320 + 304 = 24,624\n\nThen 24,624 * 170:\n\n24,624 * 100 = 2,462,400\n\n24,624 * 70 = 1,723,680\n\nTotal: 2,462,400 + 1,723,680 = 4,186,080\n\nSo z (x y - z) = 4,186,080\n\nBut we need to find z. However, we don't know x yet. So we need another equation involving x and z.\n\nWait, perhaps we can find x using the individual equations. Let's see.\n\nFrom equation 1: a = 152 / (b + c) = 152 / (x - a)\n\nSimilarly, equation 2: b = 162 / (x - b)\n\nEquation 3: c = 170 / (x - c)\n\nThis gives us three equations:\n\na(x - a) = 152 \u2192 a x - a\u00b2 = 152\n\nSimilarly:\n\nb x - b\u00b2 = 162\n\nc x - c\u00b2 = 170\n\nIf we add these three equations:\n\nx(a + b + c) - (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) = 152 + 162 + 170 = 484\n\nBut a + b + c = x, so x\u00b2 - (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) = 484\n\nBut as before, (a + b + c)\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2(ab + bc + ca) \u2192 x\u00b2 = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) + 2*242 = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) + 484\n\nTherefore, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = x\u00b2 - 484\n\nSubstituting back into x\u00b2 - (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) = 484:\n\nx\u00b2 - (x\u00b2 - 484) = 484 \u2192 484 = 484. Again, no new information.\n\nSo this approach isn't helping. Maybe we need to find x another way.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that we have three equations:\n\na(x - a) = 152\n\nb(x - b) = 162\n\nc(x - c) = 170\n\nLet me rearrange each equation:\n\nFor a: a x - a\u00b2 = 152 \u2192 a\u00b2 = a x - 152\n\nSimilarly for b and c:\n\nb\u00b2 = b x - 162\n\nc\u00b2 = c x - 170\n\nNow, let's consider that the sum of a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 can be expressed as x\u00b2 - 484 (from earlier). So:\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = x\u00b2 - 484\n\nBut substituting the expressions from above:\n\n(a x - 152) + (b x - 162) + (c x - 170) = x\u00b2 - 484\n\nFactor x:\n\nx(a + b + c) - (152 + 162 + 170) = x\u00b2 - 484\n\nBut a + b + c = x, so:\n\nx\u00b2 - 484 = x\u00b2 - 484\n\nAgain, tautology. So no help.\n\nHmm. Maybe we need to find individual values of a, b, c. But that might be complicated. Alternatively, perhaps we can use substitution.\n\nLet me try to express a, b, c in terms of x.\n\nFrom equation 1: a = 152 / (x - a)\n\nBut this is a quadratic equation in a: a(x - a) = 152 \u2192 -a\u00b2 + x a - 152 = 0 \u2192 a\u00b2 - x a + 152 = 0\n\nSimilarly for b and c:\n\nb\u00b2 - x b + 162 = 0\n\nc\u00b2 - x c + 170 = 0\n\nSo each variable a, b, c is a root of the quadratic equation t\u00b2 - x t + k = 0, where k is 152, 162, 170 respectively.\n\nBut since a, b, c are positive real numbers, each quadratic must have real roots. The discriminant must be non-negative:\n\nFor a: x\u00b2 - 4*152 \u2265 0 \u2192 x\u00b2 \u2265 608\n\nSimilarly for b: x\u00b2 \u2265 4*162 = 648\n\nFor c: x\u00b2 \u2265 4*170 = 680\n\nSo x\u00b2 must be at least 680, so x \u2265 sqrt(680) \u2248 26.07\n\nBut this is just a constraint, not directly helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider that a, b, c are the roots of the cubic equation (t - a)(t - b)(t - c) = 0, which expands to t\u00b3 - x t\u00b2 + y t - z = 0, where y = ab + bc + ca = 242, z = abc.\n\nBut how does this help? Maybe using Vieta's formulas. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that if we can find x, then we can compute z from the equation z(x y - z) = 4,186,080, where y = 242.\n\nSo we have z(242 x - z) = 4,186,080\n\nBut we need another equation involving x and z. Wait, perhaps we can find x in terms of z? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can find x by considering the sum of the equations for a, b, c.\n\nWait, from the quadratic equations:\n\na\u00b2 = x a - 152\n\nSimilarly:\n\nb\u00b2 = x b - 162\n\nc\u00b2 = x c - 170\n\nAdding these:\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = x(a + b + c) - (152 + 162 + 170) = x\u00b2 - 484 (since a + b + c = x)\n\nBut we already knew that. So again, no progress.\n\nHmm. Maybe there's a different approach. Let's think about the original equations again.\n\nWe have:\n\na(b + c) = 152 \u2192 ab + ac = 152\n\nb(c + a) = 162 \u2192 bc + ba = 162\n\nc(a + b) = 170 \u2192 ca + cb = 170\n\nLet me write these as:\n\nab + ac = 152 ...(1)\n\nba + bc = 162 ...(2)\n\nca + cb = 170 ...(3)\n\nNote that ab + ac = a(b + c) = 152, and similarly for others.\n\nIf we add all three equations, we get 2(ab + bc + ca) = 152 + 162 + 170 = 484 \u2192 ab + bc + ca = 242, which we already found.\n\nBut how to proceed from here. Let's denote ab = m, bc = n, ca = p. Then:\n\nFrom equation 1: m + p = 152\n\nFrom equation 2: m + n = 162\n\nFrom equation 3: n + p = 170\n\nNow we have three equations with three variables m, n, p.\n\nLet's solve this system.\n\nSubtract equation 1 from equation 2: (m + n) - (m + p) = 162 - 152 \u2192 n - p = 10 ...(4)\n\nFrom equation 3: n + p = 170 ...(3)\n\nNow add equations (4) and (3):\n\n(n - p) + (n + p) = 10 + 170 \u2192 2n = 180 \u2192 n = 90\n\nThen from equation (3): 90 + p = 170 \u2192 p = 80\n\nFrom equation (1): m + 80 = 152 \u2192 m = 72\n\nSo ab = 72, bc = 90, ca = 80\n\nNow, to find abc, note that (ab)(bc)(ca) = (abc)^2 \u2192 (72)(90)(80) = (abc)^2\n\nCompute 72*90 = 6480, then 6480*80 = 518,400\n\nSo (abc)^2 = 518,400 \u2192 abc = sqrt(518,400) = 720\n\nSince a, b, c are positive, abc is positive, so abc = 720. That's option D.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo find the value of \\( abc \\) given the equations \\( a(b+c) = 152 \\), \\( b(c+a) = 162 \\), and \\( c(a+b) = 170 \\), we start by analyzing the system systematically. Here's the key reasoning:\n\n1. **Introduce Variables for Products**:  \n   Let \\( ab = m \\), \\( bc = n \\), and \\( ca = p \\). The given equations then become:\n   - \\( m + p = 152 \\) (from \\( a(b+c) = 152 \\)),\n   - \\( m + n = 162 \\) (from \\( b(c+a) = 162 \\)),\n   - \\( n + p = 170 \\) (from \\( c(a+b) = 170 \\))).\n\n2. **Solve the Linear System**:  \n   Subtract the first equation from the second:  \n   \\( (m + n) - (m + p) = 162 - 152 \\implies n - p = 10 \\).  \n   Add this result to the third equation:  \n   \\( (n - p) + (n + p) = 10 + 170 \\implies 2n = 180 \\implies n = 90 \\).  \n   Substitute \\( n = 90 \\) into the third equation:  \n   \\( 90 + p = 170 \\implies p = 80 \\).  \n   Substitute \\( p = 80 \\) into the first equation:  \n   \\( m + 80 = 152 \\implies m = 72 \\).  \n   Thus, \\( ab = 72 \\), \\( bc = 90 \\), and \\( ca = 80 \\).\n\n3. **Compute \\( abc \\)**:  \n   Multiply all three products:  \n   \\[\n   (ab)(bc)(ca) = (abc)^2 \\implies (72)(90)(80) = (abc)^2.\n   \\]  \n   Calculate \\( 72 \\times 90 = 6480 \\), then \\( 6480 \\times 80 = 518{,}400 \\).  \n   Take the square root:  \n   \\[\n   abc = \\sqrt{518{,}400} = 720.\n   \\]  \n\nSince \\( a, b, c \\) are positive real numbers, \\( abc = 720 \\). The answer is **720 (Option D)**.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the sum of the final three digits of 5^100 and show that it's 13. Hmm, let's start by understanding what the problem is asking. The final three digits of a number are its value modulo 1000. So, essentially, I need to compute 5^100 mod 1000 and then add up those three digits.\n\nWait, 5^100 is a huge number, but maybe there's a pattern in the last three digits when you take powers of 5. Let me think. Let's start by calculating some lower powers of 5 to see if there's a pattern in the last three digits.\n\n5^1 = 5 \u2192 last three digits: 005 \u2192 sum 0+0+5=5\n5^2 = 25 \u2192 025 \u2192 sum 0+2+5=7\n5^3 = 125 \u2192 125 \u2192 sum 1+2+5=8\n5^4 = 625 \u2192 625 \u2192 sum 6+2+5=13\n5^5 = 3125 \u2192 last three digits 125 \u2192 same as 5^3. Wait, but 5^5 is 3125, so last three digits 125. Then 5^6 would be 5^5 *5 = 125*5=625 \u2192 625. Then 5^7 = 625*5=3125 \u2192 125 again. So it seems like after 5^3, the last three digits cycle between 125 and 625 every other power. Let's check:\n\n5^3: 125\n5^4: 625\n5^5: 125\n5^6: 625\n5^7: 125\n... and so on. So starting from exponent 3, the last three digits alternate between 125 and 625. But wait, 5^3 is 125, 5^4 is 625, 5^5 is 3125 (125), 5^6 is 15625 (625), etc. So the cycle is of length 2: 125, 625, 125, 625...\n\nBut wait, 5^1 is 5, 5^2 is 25, 5^3 is 125, then from there on, each multiplication by 5 adds a zero at the end? Wait, no. Wait, 5*5=25, 25*5=125, 125*5=625, 625*5=3125, which ends with 125. Wait, so after 5^3, multiplying by 5 gives 625, then multiplying by 5 again gives 3125 (ends with 125), and so on. So the last three digits cycle between 125 and 625 starting at exponent 3. So for even exponents starting from 3, maybe?\n\nWait, let's list them:\n\nExponent | 5^exp | last three digits\n1       | 5     | 005\n2       | 25    | 025\n3       | 125   | 125\n4       | 625   | 625\n5       | 3125  | 125\n6       | 15625 | 625\n7       | 78125 | 125\n8       | 390625| 625\n... and so on.\n\nSo starting from exponent 3, the last three digits alternate between 125 and 625. So for exponents 3,5,7,... it's 125, and for 4,6,8,... it's 625. So the cycle is every two exponents. Now, 100 is an even exponent. Let's see where 100 falls. Let's see:\n\nIf exponent is even:\n\nIf exponent is 4: 625\n\nExponent 6: 625\n\nWait, but exponent 4 is 625, exponent 6 is 625, exponent 8 is 625... Wait, no. Wait, exponent 4: 625, exponent 5: 125, exponent 6: 625, exponent 7: 125, exponent 8: 625. Wait, so for even exponents >=4, the last three digits are 625. For odd exponents >=3, the last three digits are 125. Let's check:\n\nExponent 4 (even): 625\n\nExponent 5 (odd): 125\n\nExponent 6 (even): 625\n\nExponent 7 (odd): 125\n\nYes, that's the pattern. So for even exponents starting at 4, the last three digits are 625. For odd exponents starting at 3, they are 125. So 5^100 is an even exponent (100 is even), and since 100 >=4, the last three digits should be 625. Then the sum of the digits would be 6 + 2 + 5 = 13. That's the answer we need to show.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm this pattern. Let's check exponent 10:\n\n5^10: Let's compute step by step. 5^4=625, 5^5=3125 (125), 5^6=15625 (625), 5^7=78125 (125), 5^8=390625 (625), 5^9=1953125 (125), 5^10=9765625 (625). Yes, exponent 10 (even) ends with 625. So the pattern holds. Therefore, 5^100, being even, ends with 625. Sum is 6+2+5=13.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a more mathematical way to confirm this. Let's think modulo 1000. We need to compute 5^100 mod 1000. Since 5 and 1000 are not coprime (gcd(5,1000)=5), Euler's theorem doesn't directly apply here. But perhaps we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem by splitting modulo 8 and modulo 125, since 1000=8*125 and 8 and 125 are coprime.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a simpler approach. Let's note that 5^3=125, 5^4=625. Then 5^4 \u2261 625 mod 1000. Then 5^5=5^4*5=625*5=3125 \u2261 125 mod 1000. Then 5^6=125*5=625 mod 1000. So indeed, starting from 5^3, the cycle is 125,625,125,625,... every exponent. So for exponents >=3, 5^k mod 1000 is 125 if k is odd, 625 if k is even.\n\nSince 100 is even, 5^100 mod 1000 = 625. Therefore, the last three digits are 625, sum is 6+2+5=13.\n\nAlternatively, we can use mathematical induction. Suppose that for some even n >=4, 5^n \u2261 625 mod 1000. Then 5^(n+2) = 5^n * 25. Since 5^n \u2261 625 mod 1000, multiplying by 25: 625*25=15625 \u2192 625 mod 1000. Wait, but 625*25=15625, which is 625 mod 1000. Wait, that's not right. Wait, 625*25=15,625. 15,625 mod 1000 is 625. So 5^(n+2) \u2261 625 mod 1000. Similarly, if n is even, then n+2 is even, and the result holds. Similarly, for odd exponents, starting at 3: 5^3=125, 5^5=125*25=3125 mod 1000=125. So 5^(k+2) \u2261 5^k * 25 mod 1000. If 5^k \u2261125 mod 1000, then 125*25=3125 \u2261125 mod 1000. So the cycle repeats every two exponents. Therefore, for even exponents >=4, 5^k \u2261625 mod 1000, and for odd exponents >=3, 5^k \u2261125 mod 1000.\n\nSince 100 is even and >=4, 5^100 \u2261625 mod 1000. Therefore, the last three digits are 625, sum is 6+2+5=13.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute 5^100 mod 1000 directly using exponentiation by squaring. Let's see:\n\nFirst, note that 5^1 = 5 mod 1000\n\n5^2 = 25 mod 1000\n\n5^4 = (5^2)^2 = 25^2 = 625 mod 1000\n\n5^8 = (5^4)^2 = 625^2. Let's compute 625*625:\n\n625*625 = (600+25)(600+25) = 600^2 + 2*600*25 +25^2 = 360,000 + 30,000 + 625 = 390,625. So 390,625 mod 1000 is 625.\n\nSimilarly, 5^16 = (5^8)^2 = 625^2 \u2261625 mod 1000.\n\nWait, so every time we square 625, we get 625 mod 1000. Therefore, 5^(2^k) \u2261625 mod 1000 for k >=2.\n\nSo 5^4 \u2261625, 5^8\u2261625, 5^16\u2261625, etc. So 5^100 can be written as 5^(4*25) = (5^4)^25 \u2261625^25 mod 1000.\n\nBut 625^1 \u2261625 mod 1000\n\n625^2 \u2261625*625=390625\u2261625 mod 1000\n\nSimilarly, any power of 625 mod 1000 is 625. Therefore, 625^25 \u2261625 mod 1000.\n\nTherefore, 5^100 \u2261625 mod 1000. Hence, the last three digits are 625, sum 6+2+5=13.\n\nSo all approaches confirm that the sum is 13.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo determine the sum of the final three digits of \\(5^{100}\\), we first observe that the last three digits of a number correspond to its value modulo \\(1000\\). Thus, we need to compute \\(5^{100} \\mod 1000\\) and then sum its digits.\n\n**Step 1: Identifying the pattern in powers of 5 modulo 1000**  \nCalculating lower powers of 5 modulo \\(1000\\) reveals a repeating cycle:  \n- \\(5^1 = 5\\) \u2192 last three digits: \\(005\\)  \n- \\(5^2 = 25\\) \u2192 last three digits: \\(025\\)  \n- \\(5^3 = 125\\) \u2192 last three digits: \\(125\\)  \n- \\(5^4 = 625\\) \u2192 last three digits: \\(625\\)  \n- \\(5^5 = 3125\\) \u2192 last three digits: \\(125\\)  \n- \\(5^6 = 15625\\) \u2192 last three digits: \\(625\\)  \n\nStarting at \\(5^3\\), the last three digits alternate between \\(125\\) (for odd exponents \\(\\geq 3\\)) and \\(625\\) (for even exponents \\(\\geq 4\\)). This pattern repeats every two exponents.  \n\n**Step 2: Applying the pattern to \\(5^{100}\\)**  \nSince \\(100\\) is an even exponent greater than \\(4\\), the last three digits of \\(5^{100}\\) follow the even-exponent pattern: \\(625\\).  \n\n**Step 3: Verifying the cycle mathematically**  \nFor even \\(k \\geq 4\\), \\(5^k \\equiv 625 \\mod 1000\\).

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to find two positive integers m and n such that their greatest common divisor (gcd) is 8 and their least common multiple (lcm) is 112. Then, I have to show that the smallest possible sum m + n is 72. Hmm, let's start by recalling some properties of gcd and lcm.\n\nI remember that for any two positive integers, the product of their gcd and lcm is equal to the product of the numbers themselves. So, m * n = gcd(m, n) * lcm(m, n). Here, that would mean m * n = 8 * 112 = 896. So, m and n are two numbers whose product is 896, and their gcd is 8. \n\nSince their gcd is 8, both m and n must be multiples of 8. Let me express them in terms of 8. Let\u2019s say m = 8a and n = 8b, where a and b are positive integers. The gcd of m and n is 8, so the gcd of a and b must be 1, because if a and b had a common divisor greater than 1, then the gcd of m and n would be 8 times that divisor, which would be more than 8. So, a and b are coprime (their gcd is 1).\n\nNow, substituting m and n into the product equation: (8a) * (8b) = 896. That simplifies to 64ab = 896. Dividing both sides by 64 gives ab = 14. So, a and b are coprime positive integers whose product is 14. \n\nNow, I need to find all pairs of (a, b) such that a and b are coprime and a * b = 14. The possible pairs are (1,14) and (2,7). Let me check if these are coprime. For (1,14), gcd(1,14) is 1. For (2,7), gcd(2,7) is also 1. So both pairs are valid.\n\nNow, converting back to m and n. For the first pair (a=1, b=14), m = 8*1 = 8 and n = 8*14 = 112. Their sum is 8 + 112 = 120. For the second pair (a=2, b=7), m = 8*2 = 16 and n = 8*7 = 56. Their sum is 16 + 56 = 72. There's also the pair (a=7, b=2) and (a=14, b=1), but those would just swap m and n, giving the same sums. \n\nSo the minimal sum is 72. Therefore, the least possible value of m + n is 72.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo solve the problem, we start by using the relationship between the greatest common divisor (gcd) and least common multiple (lcm) of two numbers. For any positive integers \\( m \\) and \\( n \\), it holds that:\n\\[\nm \\cdot n = \\gcd(m, n) \\cdot \\operatorname{lcm}(m, n).\n\\]\nGiven \\(\\gcd(m, n) = 8\\) and \\(\\operatorname{lcm}(m, n) = 112\\), we substitute these values:\n\\[\nm \\cdot n = 8 \\cdot 112 = 896.\n\\]\n\nSince \\( \\gcd(m, n) = 8 \\), both \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) must be multiples of \\( 8 \\). Let \\( m = 8a \\) and \\( n = 8b \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are coprime integers (i.e., \\(\\gcd(a, b) = 1\\)). Substituting these into the product equation:\n\\[\n(8a) \\cdot (8b) = 896 \\implies 64ab = 896 \\implies ab = 14.\n\\]\n\nWe now find all pairs \\( (a, b) \\) of coprime positive integers that multiply to \\( 14 \\). These pairs are:\n1. \\( (1, 14) \\)\n2. \\( (2, 7) \\)\n\nFor each pair, we compute \\( m \\) and \\( n \\):\n- For \\( (a = 1, b = 14) \\): \\( m = 8 \\cdot 1 = 8 \\), \\( n = 8 \\cdot 14 = 112 \\).

Sum: \\( 16 + 56 = 72 \\).\n\nThe smallest sum is \\( 72 \\), achieved when \\( m = 16 \\) and \\( n = 56 \\). Thus, the least possible value of \\( m + n \\) is **72**.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  ?m.gcd ?n * ?m.lcm

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the maximum value of the function f(t) = [(2^t - 3t)t] / 4^t for real t. The answer choices suggest it's one of the fractions given, and the correct answer is supposed to be 1/12. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, maybe I should simplify the expression. Let's write it out again: f(t) = [t(2^t - 3t)] / 4^t. Hmm, 4^t is the same as (2^2)^t = 2^(2t). So 4^t = 2^(2t). Therefore, f(t) can be rewritten as [t(2^t - 3t)] / 2^(2t). That might make it easier to handle exponents.\n\nAlternatively, maybe express everything in terms of (1/2)^t or something. Let's see. Let me try to rewrite f(t):\n\nf(t) = t(2^t - 3t) / 4^t = t * 2^t / 4^t - 3t^2 / 4^t = t*(2^t / 4^t) - 3t^2 / 4^t.\n\nBut 2^t / 4^t is (2/4)^t = (1/2)^t. Similarly, 4^t is 2^(2t), so 1/4^t is (1/2)^{2t}. So maybe:\n\nf(t) = t*(1/2)^t - 3t^2*(1/2)^{2t}.\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe taking derivatives would be the way to go here since we need to find a maximum. To find the maximum of a function, we can take its derivative, set it equal to zero, and solve for t. Then check if that's a maximum using the second derivative or sign changes.\n\nSo let's compute f'(t) and set it to zero. Let's first write f(t) as [t*2^t - 3t^2] / 4^t. Alternatively, maybe factor out terms. Let me see:\n\nf(t) = [t*2^t - 3t^2] / 4^t = t*2^t / 4^t - 3t^2 / 4^t = t*(2^t / 4^t) - 3t^2 / 4^t.\n\nBut 2^t / 4^t = (2/4)^t = (1/2)^t, and 4^t = (2^2)^t = 2^{2t}, so 1/4^t = 2^{-2t}. So:\n\nf(t) = t*(1/2)^t - 3t^2*(1/2)^{2t}.\n\nAlternatively, maybe substitute variables. Let me set u = (1/2)^t. Then, since u = e^{-t ln 2}, but maybe that complicates things. Alternatively, take natural logs? But since the function is not just a product, but a combination of terms, taking the derivative directly might be better.\n\nLet me proceed step by step. Let's denote the numerator as N(t) = t(2^t - 3t) and the denominator as D(t) = 4^t. So f(t) = N(t)/D(t). To find f'(t), we can use the quotient rule: f'(t) = [N'(t)D(t) - N(t)D'(t)] / [D(t)]^2.\n\nFirst, compute N(t) = t*2^t - 3t^2. Therefore, N'(t) is the derivative of t*2^t minus the derivative of 3t^2. The derivative of t*2^t is 2^t + t*2^t ln 2 (using product rule). The derivative of 3t^2 is 6t. So N'(t) = 2^t + t*2^t ln 2 - 6t.\n\nThen D(t) = 4^t, so D'(t) = 4^t ln 4.\n\nPutting this into the quotient rule:\n\nf'(t) = [ (2^t + t*2^t ln 2 - 6t) * 4^t - (t*2^t - 3t^2) * 4^t ln 4 ] / (4^t)^2.\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\nFactor out 4^t in the numerator:\n\n4^t [ (2^t + t*2^t ln 2 - 6t) - (t*2^t - 3t^2) ln 4 ] / 4^{2t} = [ (2^t + t*2^t ln 2 - 6t) - (t*2^t - 3t^2) ln 4 ] / 4^t.\n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way to simplify before differentiating. Let's try to express everything in terms of 2^t. Since 4^t = (2^t)^2. Let me write f(t) as [t*2^t - 3t^2] / (2^t)^2 = [t*2^t - 3t^2] / (2^{2t}) = t*2^{-t} - 3t^2*2^{-2t}.\n\nSo f(t) = t*(2^{-t}) - 3t^2*(2^{-2t}).\n\nNow, let's compute the derivative f'(t):\n\nFirst term: d/dt [t*2^{-t}]. Let's use product rule. Let u = t, v = 2^{-t}. Then u' = 1, v' = -2^{-t} ln 2. So derivative is 1*2^{-t} + t*(-2^{-t} ln 2) = 2^{-t}(1 - t ln 2).\n\nSecond term: d/dt [ -3t^2*2^{-2t} ]. Let's factor out -3. The derivative is -3*[d/dt(t^2*2^{-2t})]. Use product rule here as well. Let u = t^2, v = 2^{-2t}. Then u' = 2t, v' = -2*2^{-2t} ln 2. So derivative is -3*[2t*2^{-2t} + t^2*(-2*2^{-2t} ln 2)] = -3*2^{-2t}[2t - 2t^2 ln 2].\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nf'(t) = 2^{-t}(1 - t ln 2) - 3*2^{-2t}[2t - 2t^2 ln 2].\n\nFactor out 2^{-2t} from both terms. Note that 2^{-t} = 2^{-2t} * 2^{t}. So:\n\nf'(t) = 2^{-2t}[2^{t}(1 - t ln 2) - 3(2t - 2t^2 ln 2)].\n\nBut 2^{t} * 2^{-2t} = 2^{-t}, so maybe this isn't the most helpful. Alternatively, let's factor 2^{-2t}:\n\nf'(t) = 2^{-2t} [2^{t}(1 - t ln 2) - 3(2t - 2t^2 ln 2)].\n\nLet me compute the expression inside the brackets:\n\nFirst term: 2^{t}(1 - t ln 2)\n\nSecond term: -3*(2t - 2t^2 ln 2) = -6t + 6t^2 ln 2\n\nSo combining:\n\n2^{t}(1 - t ln 2) -6t +6t^2 ln 2.\n\nHmm, this still looks complicated. Maybe set f'(t) = 0. Since 2^{-2t} is always positive, the equation reduces to:\n\n2^{t}(1 - t ln 2) -6t +6t^2 ln 2 = 0.\n\nThis seems difficult to solve algebraically. Maybe we need to make a substitution. Let me let y = 2^t. Then ln y = t ln 2, so t = (ln y)/ln 2. But substituting might not help here. Alternatively, perhaps try to guess the value of t where the maximum occurs. The answer choices are fractions, so maybe t is a small integer or simple fraction.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the maximum occurs at some t where the derivative is zero. Let's try plugging in t=1:\n\nCompute f(1): [2^1 -3*1]*1 /4^1 = (2 -3)/4 = (-1)/4 = -0.25. Not positive. So maybe t=0? f(0) is 0. t=2: [2^2 -3*2]*2 /4^2 = (4 -6)*2 /16 = (-2)*2 /16 = -4/16 = -0.25. Still negative. Hmm, maybe t is a fractional value where the expression becomes positive.\n\nWait, let's check t=0.5: 2^0.5 is sqrt(2) \u22481.414. Then 2^0.5 -3*0.5 \u22481.414 -1.5 \u2248-0.086. Multiply by t=0.5: \u2248-0.043. Divide by 4^0.5=2: \u2248-0.0215. Still negative.\n\nt=0. Let's see, as t approaches 0 from the right, the numerator is t*(2^t -3t). 2^t \u22481 + t ln2, so 2^t -3t \u22481 + t ln2 -3t =1 + t(ln2 -3). So for small t>0, the numerator is approximately t*(1 + t(ln2 -3)) \u2248t, which is positive. But denominator is 4^t \u22481 + t ln4. So f(t) \u2248 t / (1 + t ln4) \u2248 t. So as t approaches 0 from the right, f(t) approaches 0. But maybe there's a maximum somewhere between t=0 and t where the expression becomes positive.\n\nWait, but when t is negative? Let's check t negative. Let's take t=-1: 2^{-1}=0.5, 3*(-1)= -3. So numerator: (-1)*(0.5 - (-3)) = (-1)*(3.5) = -3.5. Denominator:4^{-1}=0.25. So f(-1)= -3.5 /0.25= -14. Negative. So maybe the function is negative for t negative. So perhaps the maximum occurs at some positive t where the expression is positive.\n\nWait, but earlier at t=0.5, it's negative. Wait, maybe the function is positive for some t between 0 and where 2^t -3t is positive. Let's solve 2^t -3t >0. Let's see when 2^t >3t. For t=0: 1>0. For t=0.5: ~1.414>1.5? No, 1.414 <1.5. So at t=0.5, 2^t -3t is negative. At t=0.2: 2^0.2\u22481.1487, 3*0.2=0.6. 1.1487 -0.6\u22480.5487>0. So between t=0 and t\u22480.3, 2^t -3t is positive. Let's check t=0.2: f(t)=0.2*(2^0.2 -3*0.2)/4^0.2. Compute 2^0.2\u22481.1487, 3*0.2=0.6, so numerator\u22480.2*(1.1487 -0.6)=0.2*0.5487\u22480.1097. Denominator 4^0.2\u2248(2^2)^0.2=2^0.4\u22481.3195. So f(t)\u22480.1097 /1.3195\u22480.083. So positive. At t=0.3: 2^0.3\u22481.2311, 3*0.3=0.9. 1.2311 -0.9\u22480.3311. Multiply by t=0.3:\u22480.0993. Denominator 4^0.3\u22482^0.6\u22481.5157. So f(t)\u22480.0993 /1.5157\u22480.0655. So decreasing from t=0.2 to t=0.3. Wait, but at t=0.1: 2^0.1\u22481.071, 3*0.1=0.3. 1.071 -0.3\u22480.771. Multiply by 0.1:\u22480.0771. Denominator 4^0.1\u22481.1487. So f(t)=0.0771 /1.1487\u22480.067. So the maximum seems to be around t=0.2. But this is conflicting with the answer choices given, which are 1/16\u22480.0625, 1/15\u22480.0667, 1/12\u22480.0833, etc. Wait, at t=0.2, we get approximately 0.083, which is 1/12\u22480.0833. So maybe the maximum is around t=0.2, which would correspond to 1/12. But how to confirm this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a critical point where the derivative is zero. Let's try to set f'(t)=0. From earlier, we have:\n\n2^{t}(1 - t ln 2) -6t +6t^2 ln 2 =0.\n\nThis equation seems hard to solve analytically. Maybe we can make an intelligent guess. Let's suppose that the maximum occurs at t=1/5 (0.2), which is 1/5. Let's check t=1/5.\n\nCompute 2^{1/5}\u22481.1487, ln2\u22480.6931.\n\nLeft-hand side (LHS):\n\n2^{1/5}(1 - (1/5)(0.6931)) -6*(1/5) +6*(1/5)^2*0.6931\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: 1.1487*(1 - 0.1386) \u22481.1487*0.8614\u22480.991.\n\nSecond term: -6*(0.2)= -1.2.\n\nThird term:6*(0.04)*0.6931\u22480.24*0.6931\u22480.1663.\n\nSo total LHS\u22480.991 -1.2 +0.1663\u2248(0.991 +0.1663) -1.2\u22481.1573 -1.2\u2248-0.0427. Close to zero but not exactly. So f'(1/5)\u2248-0.0427, which is slightly negative. So the function is decreasing at t=0.2. Hmm, but we saw that f(t) at t=0.2 is approximately 0.083, which is close to 1/12\u22480.0833. Maybe the maximum is near there.\n\nWait, maybe try t=0.25. Let's compute f(t) at t=0.25:\n\nNumerator:0.25*(2^0.25 -3*0.25). 2^0.25\u22481.1892, 3*0.25=0.75. So 1.1892 -0.75\u22480.4392. Multiply by 0.25\u22480.1098. Denominator:4^0.25=sqrt(2)\u22481.4142. So f(t)=0.1098 /1.4142\u22480.0776. So less than at t=0.2.\n\nWait, but earlier at t=0.2, f(t)\u22480.083, which is higher. Let's try t=0.18:\n\nCompute 2^0.18\u2248e^{0.18 ln2}\u2248e^{0.1247}\u22481.1325. 3*0.18=0.54. So 2^0.18 -0.54\u22481.1325 -0.54\u22480.5925. Multiply by t=0.18:\u22480.1067. Denominator:4^0.18=2^{0.36}\u22481.274. So f(t)=0.1067 /1.274\u22480.0837. That's even higher. So maybe the maximum is around t\u22480.18.\n\nBut this is getting messy. Maybe there's a substitution. Let me set t= ln(2)/ (3 ln 2 - something). Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, let's consider that the maximum occurs when the derivative is zero. Let's denote:\n\nFrom f'(t)=0:\n\n2^{t}(1 - t ln2) -6t +6t^2 ln2 =0.\n\nLet me factor out terms involving 2^t and terms involving t:\n\n2^{t}(1 - t ln2) =6t -6t^2 ln2.\n\nDivide both sides by 2^{t}:\n\n1 - t ln2 =6t*(1 - t ln2)/2^{t}.\n\nWait, that might not help. Alternatively, rearrange:\n\n2^{t}(1 - t ln2) =6t(1 - t ln2).\n\nWait, but that would require 2^{t}=6t, but only if 1 -t ln2 \u22600. But if 1 -t ln2=0, then t=1/ln2\u22481.4427. Let's check if that's a solution. If t=1/ln2\u22481.4427, then 1 -t ln2=0. Then the left side is 2^{t}*0=0, and the right side is 6t(1 -t ln2)=0. So yes, t=1/ln2 is a solution. But at that t, what is f(t)? Let's compute f(1/ln2):\n\nt=1/ln2\u22481.4427.\n\nNumerator: t*(2^t -3t). 2^t=2^{1/ln2}=",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the value of x that gives the minimum value for the quadratic equation x\u00b2 -14x +3. The problem also mentions to show that it's 7. Let me start by recalling what I know about quadratic functions.\n\nFirst, I remember that a quadratic function in the form f(x) = ax\u00b2 + bx + c has a graph that's a parabola. If the coefficient a is positive, the parabola opens upwards, meaning the vertex is the minimum point. If a is negative, it opens downwards, and the vertex is the maximum. In this case, the equation is x\u00b2 -14x +3, so the coefficient of x\u00b2 is 1, which is positive. That means the parabola opens upwards, and the vertex will give the minimum value. So, the x-coordinate of the vertex is the value we're looking for.\n\nNow, how do I find the vertex of a quadratic function? There's a formula for the x-coordinate of the vertex, right? It's -b/(2a). Let me check that. For the general form ax\u00b2 + bx + c, the vertex is at x = -b/(2a). Here, a is 1 and b is -14. Plugging those into the formula: x = -(-14)/(2*1) = 14/2 = 7. So that gives x=7. That seems straightforward, but maybe I should verify this using another method to be sure, like completing the square, since the example in the context used that method.\n\nLet me try completing the square for the given quadratic. Starting with x\u00b2 -14x +3. To complete the square, I need to take the coefficient of x, which is -14, divide it by 2 to get -7, and then square it to get 49. So, the idea is to write the quadratic as (x -7)\u00b2 minus the square term plus the constant. Let's see:\n\nx\u00b2 -14x +3 = (x\u00b2 -14x) +3. To complete the square, add and subtract (14/2)\u00b2 = 49. So:\n\n= (x\u00b2 -14x +49) -49 +3\n= (x -7)\u00b2 -46\n\nSo the expression becomes (x -7)\u00b2 -46. Since a square term is always non-negative, the smallest value (x -7)\u00b2 can take is 0, which happens when x=7. Therefore, the minimum value of the entire expression is -46 when x=7. That confirms the result from the vertex formula.\n\nWait, the problem says to \"show that it is 7,\" so maybe they want the process of completing the square or using the vertex formula. Since the example in the context used completing the square, perhaps that's the preferred method here. Let me make sure I didn't skip any steps. Let's go through it again step by step.\n\nStarting with x\u00b2 -14x +3. The goal is to write it in the form (x - h)\u00b2 + k, where h is the x-coordinate of the vertex. The coefficient of x\u00b2 is 1, so that's easy. Take half of the coefficient of x, which is -14/2 = -7. Then square it: (-7)\u00b2 = 49. So, we add and subtract 49 inside the expression:\n\nx\u00b2 -14x +3 = (x\u00b2 -14x +49) -49 +3\n= (x -7)\u00b2 -46\n\nNow, since (x -7)\u00b2 is always \u22650, the minimum occurs when (x -7)\u00b2 =0, which is when x=7. Therefore, the minimum value of the quadratic is -46 at x=7. That's solid.\n\nAlternatively, using calculus, if I take the derivative of the function f(x) = x\u00b2 -14x +3, the derivative is f'(x) = 2x -14. Setting that equal to zero gives 2x -14 =0 \u2192 x=7. Then the second derivative is 2, which is positive, confirming it's a minimum. But since the context didn't mention calculus, maybe stick to algebraic methods.\n\nAnother way is to use symmetry. The quadratic's roots, if they exist, are symmetric around the vertex. But since we don't have roots here (the discriminant is (-14)^2 -4*1*3 = 196 -12 =184, which is positive, so there are two real roots), but finding them might not be necessary. The vertex formula is quicker.\n\nBut the problem specifically asks to show that the minimum occurs at x=7, so either method works. Since the example used completing the square, that's probably the expected approach here. So, the key steps are completing the square to rewrite the quadratic in vertex form, which directly shows the vertex at x=7.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo find the value of \\( x \\) that minimizes the quadratic expression \\( x^2 - 14x + 3 \\), we can use the method of **completing the square**. Here's how it works:\n\n1. **Start with the given expression**:\n   \\[\n   x^2 - 14x + 3\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Focus on the \\( x^2 \\) and \\( x \\) terms**:\n   \\[\n   x^2 - 14x\n   \\]\n   To complete the square, take half of the coefficient of \\( x \\), which is \\( -14 \\), divide by 2 to get \\( -7 \\), and then square it to get \\( (-7)^2 = 49 \\).\n\n3. **Add and subtract this square**:\n   \\[\n   x^2 - 14x + 49 - 49 + 3\n   \\]\n   This keeps the expression equivalent to the original but allows us to group the first three terms into a perfect square.\n\n4. **Rewrite as a squared term**:\n   \\[\n   (x - 7)^2 - 49 + 3\n   \\]\n   Simplifying further:\n   \\[\n   (x - 7)^2 - 46\n   \\]\n\n5. **Interpret the result**:\n   The expression \\( (x - 7)^2 - 46 \\) is now in vertex form. Since \\( (x - 7)^2 \\) is always non-negative (a square is never negative), its smallest possible value is \\( 0 \\). This occurs when \\( x - 7 = 0 \\), or \\( x = 7 \\). At this point, the entire expression \\( (x - 7)^2 - 46 \\) reaches its minimum value of \\( -46 \\).\n\nThus, the value \\( x = 7 \\) gives the minimum value of the quadratic expression. This aligns with the general rule for quadratics: the vertex (minimum or maximum) occurs at \\( x = -\\frac{b}{2a} \\) for \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\). Here, \\( a = 1 \\) and \\( b = -14 \\), so \\( x = -\\frac{-14}{2 \\cdot 1} = 7 \\), confirming the result.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem: finding how many solutions the equation tan(2x) = cos(x/2) has on the interval [0, 2\u03c0]. The answer is supposed to be 5, but I need to figure out why. \n\nFirst, I remember that the tangent function has a period of \u03c0, so tan(2x) would have a period of \u03c0/2 because the argument is 2x. That means it repeats every \u03c0/2 units. But the interval we're looking at is [0, 2\u03c0], so 2x would go from 0 to 4\u03c0. Hmm, maybe that's useful later.\n\nOn the other hand, cos(x/2) has a period of 4\u03c0 because the period of cos(kx) is 2\u03c0/k. Here, k is 1/2, so the period is 2\u03c0/(1/2) = 4\u03c0. But our interval for x is [0, 2\u03c0], so x/2 goes from 0 to \u03c0. So cos(x/2) will go from cos(0)=1 down to cos(\u03c0)=-1. Wait, but cosine is even, so maybe it's symmetric around \u03c0/2? Not sure yet.\n\nThe equation is tan(2x) = cos(x/2). Let's think about how to solve this. Maybe express tan(2x) in terms of sine and cosine? So tan(2x) = sin(2x)/cos(2x). But not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe use some identities. Let me recall that tan(2x) can be written as 2 tan x / (1 - tan\u00b2x), but that might complicate things more.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to consider substituting variables. Let me set \u03b8 = x/2. Then x = 2\u03b8, and the equation becomes tan(4\u03b8) = cos(\u03b8). The interval for x is [0, 2\u03c0], so \u03b8 would be in [0, \u03c0]. So we need to solve tan(4\u03b8) = cos(\u03b8) where \u03b8 \u2208 [0, \u03c0]. Maybe this substitution simplifies things? Let's see.\n\nBut tan(4\u03b8) has a period of \u03c0/4, so over \u03b8 in [0, \u03c0], 4\u03b8 goes from 0 to 4\u03c0, so tan(4\u03b8) will have vertical asymptotes at 4\u03b8 = \u03c0/2 + k\u03c0, which translates to \u03b8 = \u03c0/8 + k\u03c0/4. In the interval [0, \u03c0], these asymptotes occur at \u03b8 = \u03c0/8, 3\u03c0/8, 5\u03c0/8, 7\u03c0/8, 9\u03c0/8, etc., but 9\u03c0/8 is more than \u03c0 (since \u03c0 is about 3.14, 9\u03c0/8 \u2248 3.534, which is beyond \u03c0 \u2248 3.1416). Wait, actually, 4\u03b8 goes up to 4\u03c0 when \u03b8 is \u03c0, but \u03b8 is only up to \u03c0. Wait, no, \u03b8 is in [0, \u03c0], so 4\u03b8 is in [0, 4\u03c0]. So the asymptotes for tan(4\u03b8) in \u03b8 would be at \u03b8 = \u03c0/8 + k\u03c0/4 for k = 0,1,2,...,7? Let me check:\n\nFor k=0: \u03c0/8 \u2248 0.3927\nk=1: 3\u03c0/8 \u2248 1.178\nk=2: 5\u03c0/8 \u2248 1.963\nk=3: 7\u03c0/8 \u2248 2.748\nk=4: 9\u03c0/8 \u2248 3.534 (which is beyond \u03c0 \u2248 3.1416)\nSo in \u03b8 \u2208 [0, \u03c0], the asymptotes are at \u03c0/8, 3\u03c0/8, 5\u03c0/8, 7\u03c0/8. So between each of these points, tan(4\u03b8) goes from -\u221e to \u221e or vice versa. So each interval between the asymptotes is a period of the tangent function. So between \u03b8 = 0 and \u03c0/8, tan(4\u03b8) goes from 0 to \u221e. Then from \u03c0/8 to 3\u03c0/8, it goes from -\u221e to \u221e. Wait, no: tan(4\u03b8) when \u03b8 approaches \u03c0/8 from the left, 4\u03b8 approaches \u03c0/2 from below, so tan(4\u03b8) approaches +\u221e. Then, just after \u03c0/8, 4\u03b8 is just above \u03c0/2, so tan(4\u03b8) approaches -\u221e. Then from 3\u03c0/8 to 5\u03c0/8, it goes from +\u221e to -\u221e again? Wait, maybe each interval between the asymptotes is where tan(4\u03b8) goes from -\u221e to +\u221e or vice versa. Hmm, perhaps it's better to sketch the graph mentally.\n\nAlternatively, maybe plotting both sides of the equation tan(2x) = cos(x/2) over [0, 2\u03c0] would help visualize the number of intersections. Let's think about the behavior of both functions.\n\nFirst, tan(2x) has vertical asymptotes where 2x = \u03c0/2 + k\u03c0, so x = \u03c0/4 + k\u03c0/2. In [0, 2\u03c0], these asymptotes are at x = \u03c0/4, 3\u03c0/4, 5\u03c0/4, 7\u03c0/4. So between each pair of asymptotes, tan(2x) goes from -\u221e to +\u221e or +\u221e to -\u221e. Each interval between asymptotes is of length \u03c0/2. So in each interval (\u03c0/4, 3\u03c0/4), (3\u03c0/4, 5\u03c0/4), etc., tan(2x) spans from -\u221e to +\u221e once.\n\nOn the other hand, cos(x/2) is a cosine function with period 4\u03c0, but since x is in [0, 2\u03c0], x/2 is in [0, \u03c0]. So cos(x/2) starts at cos(0) = 1, decreases to cos(\u03c0) = -1. So it's a decreasing function from 1 to -1 over [0, 2\u03c0]. Wait, but x is from 0 to 2\u03c0, so x/2 goes from 0 to \u03c0. So cos(x/2) starts at 1, decreases to -1 at x=2\u03c0. So the graph of cos(x/2) is a smooth curve decreasing from 1 to -1.\n\nNow, the equation tan(2x) = cos(x/2). Let's consider the intervals between the asymptotes of tan(2x), which are at x = \u03c0/4, 3\u03c0/4, 5\u03c0/4, 7\u03c0/4. So the intervals are:\n\n1. [0, \u03c0/4)\n2. (\u03c0/4, 3\u03c0/4)\n3. (3\u03c0/4, 5\u03c0/4)\n4. (5\u03c0/4, 7\u03c0/4)\n5. (7\u03c0/4, 2\u03c0]\n\nIn each of these intervals, tan(2x) goes from 0 to +\u221e (in the first interval), then from -\u221e to +\u221e in the second, then from -\u221e to +\u221e in the third, etc. Wait, let's check:\n\nIn the first interval, x \u2208 [0, \u03c0/4), so 2x \u2208 [0, \u03c0/2). So tan(2x) goes from 0 to +\u221e as x approaches \u03c0/4 from the left.\n\nIn the second interval, x \u2208 (\u03c0/4, 3\u03c0/4), so 2x \u2208 (\u03c0/2, 3\u03c0/2). Here, tan(2x) starts from -\u221e (as x approaches \u03c0/4 from the right) and goes to +\u221e as x approaches 3\u03c0/4 from the left? Wait, no. Wait, tan(\u03b8) has period \u03c0, so between \u03c0/2 and 3\u03c0/2, it goes from -\u221e to +\u221e. Wait, when \u03b8 approaches \u03c0/2 from above, tan \u03b8 approaches -\u221e, then increases to 0 at \u03b8=\u03c0, then goes to +\u221e as \u03b8 approaches 3\u03c0/2 from below. Wait, no: tan(\u03b8) is negative in (\u03c0/2, \u03c0) and positive in (\u03c0, 3\u03c0/2). Wait, let me correct:\n\nAt \u03b8 = \u03c0/2, tan \u03b8 is undefined. For \u03b8 just above \u03c0/2, tan \u03b8 is very large negative. As \u03b8 increases towards \u03c0, tan \u03b8 approaches 0 from below (since in (\u03c0/2, \u03c0), tan \u03b8 is negative). Then at \u03b8=\u03c0, tan \u03b8 is 0. Then as \u03b8 approaches 3\u03c0/2 from below, tan \u03b8 approaches +\u221e (since in (\u03c0, 3\u03c0/2), tan \u03b8 is positive). Wait, no: Wait, in (\u03c0/2, \u03c0), sine is positive and cosine is negative, so tan \u03b8 is negative. So as \u03b8 approaches \u03c0/2 from above, tan \u03b8 approaches -\u221e. Then at \u03b8=\u03c0, tan \u03b8 is 0. Then as \u03b8 approaches 3\u03c0/2 from below, tan \u03b8 approaches +\u221e because in (\u03c0, 3\u03c0/2), sine is negative and cosine is negative, so tan \u03b8 is positive. Wait, no: in (\u03c0, 3\u03c0/2), sine is negative, cosine is negative, so tan \u03b8 is positive. Wait, no: sine is negative, cosine is negative, so tan \u03b8 is positive. So as \u03b8 approaches 3\u03c0/2 from below, tan \u03b8 approaches +\u221e. Wait, but that's not right. Wait, let's take \u03b8 approaching 3\u03c0/2 from the left (i.e., \u03b8 slightly less than 3\u03c0/2). Then sin \u03b8 is -1 (approaching from left, sin \u03b8 approaches -1), cos \u03b8 approaches 0 from the negative side (since 3\u03c0/2 is where cos \u03b8 is 0, approaching from left, cos \u03b8 is negative). So tan \u03b8 = sin \u03b8 / cos \u03b8 approaches (-1)/(0-) = +\u221e. So yes, tan \u03b8 approaches +\u221e as \u03b8 approaches 3\u03c0/2 from below.\n\nSo in the interval (\u03c0/4, 3\u03c0/4), which corresponds to 2x in (\u03c0/2, 3\u03c0/2), tan(2x) starts at -\u221e (x approaching \u03c0/4 from the right), increases to 0 at x=\u03c0/2 (since 2x=\u03c0), then goes to +\u221e as x approaches 3\u03c0/4 from the left.\n\nSimilarly, in the next interval (3\u03c0/4, 5\u03c0/4), 2x is in (3\u03c0/2, 5\u03c0/2). But 5\u03c0/2 is equivalent to \u03c0/2 modulo \u03c0, but let's see: tan(2x) here would go from +\u221e (at x approaching 3\u03c0/4 from the right, 2x approaches 3\u03c0/2 from above, which is equivalent to \u03c0/2 in the next period. Wait, no: tan is periodic with period \u03c0, so tan(3\u03c0/2 + \u03b5) = tan(\u03c0/2 + \u03b5) = -cot \u03b5, which approaches -\u221e as \u03b5 approaches 0 from above. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let's think again.\n\nIf x is in (3\u03c0/4, 5\u03c0/4), then 2x is in (3\u03c0/2, 5\u03c0/2). Let's subtract 2\u03c0 from 5\u03c0/2 to get \u03c0/2. So tan(2x) = tan(2x - 2\u03c0) = tan(\u03b8) where \u03b8 is in (3\u03c0/2 - 2\u03c0, 5\u03c0/2 - 2\u03c0) = (-\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2). Wait, but tan has period \u03c0, so tan(\u03b8) = tan(\u03b8 + \u03c0). So tan(3\u03c0/2 + \u03b5) = tan(\u03c0/2 + \u03b5) = -cot \u03b5, which approaches -\u221e as \u03b5 approaches 0 from above. Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to consider that in each interval between asymptotes, tan(2x) goes from -\u221e to +\u221e or +\u221e to -\u221e.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps instead of getting bogged down in the asymptotes, I should consider the equation tan(2x) = cos(x/2) and try to find the number of intersections between these two functions over [0, 2\u03c0].\n\nLet's consider the graph of tan(2x) which has vertical asymptotes at x = \u03c0/4, 3\u03c0/4, 5\u03c0/4, 7\u03c0/4. Between each pair of asymptotes, tan(2x) goes from -\u221e to +\u221e or vice versa. Meanwhile, cos(x/2) is a smooth curve decreasing from 1 to -1 over [0, 2\u03c0]. So in each interval between asymptotes, the equation tan(2x) = cos(x/2) should have exactly one solution because tan(2x) spans all real numbers from -\u221e to +\u221e, and cos(x/2) is a continuous function that changes slowly. However, this might not always be the case because cos(x/2) is decreasing, so maybe in some intervals, the equation has two solutions? Wait, but in each interval between asymptotes, tan(2x) covers all real numbers once. So if cos(x/2) is continuous and strictly monotonic (which it is, decreasing from 1 to -1), then in each interval where tan(2x) goes from -\u221e to +\u221e, there should be exactly one point where they cross. But wait, cos(x/2) is decreasing, so depending on the interval, maybe there are two crossings in some intervals?\n\nWait, let's think carefully. Suppose in an interval where tan(2x) goes from -\u221e to +\u221e, and cos(x/2) is decreasing. If in that interval, cos(x/2) starts above some value and ends below, then there must be exactly one crossing. Because tan(2x) passes through every real value exactly once, and cos(x/2) is moving from higher to lower. So they must cross exactly once per interval between asymptotes. But there are four intervals between the asymptotes (excluding the asymptotes themselves), so that would suggest four solutions. But the answer is supposed to be five. Hmm, so where's the fifth solution?\n\nWait, maybe there's an interval where the function cos(x/2) is crossing tan(2x) more than once? Or perhaps there's a solution at x=0 or x=2\u03c0? Let's check the endpoints.\n\nAt x=0: tan(0) = 0, cos(0/2)=cos(0)=1. So 0 \u2260 1, so no solution at x=0.\n\nAt x=2\u03c0: tan(4\u03c0) = 0, cos(\u03c0) = -1. So 0 \u2260 -1, so no solution there.\n\nBut maybe in the first interval [0, \u03c0/4), tan(2x) goes from 0 to +\u221e, and cos(x/2) starts at 1 and decreases to cos(\u03c0/8) \u2248 0.9239. So in this interval, tan(2x) increases from 0 to +\u221e, and cos(x/2) decreases from 1 to ~0.9239. So they must cross exactly once here, since tan(2x) starts below cos(x/2) (0 < 1) and ends above (since tan(2x) approaches +\u221e and cos(x/2) is ~0.9239). So one solution in [0, \u03c0/4).\n\nThen in (\u03c0/4, 3\u03c0/4): tan(2x) goes from -\u221e to +\u221e. Cos(x/2) starts at cos(\u03c0/8) \u2248 0.9239 and decreases to cos(3\u03c0/8) \u2248 0.3827. So as tan(2x) goes from -\u221e to +\u221e, and cos(x/2) is decreasing from ~0.9239 to ~0.3827. So there must be exactly one crossing here as well. So that's a second solution.\n\nIn (3\u03c0/4, 5\u03c0/4): tan(2x) goes from -\u221e to +\u221e. Cos(x/2) starts at cos(3\u03c0/8) \u2248 0.3827 and decreases to cos(5\u03c0/8) \u2248 -0.3827. So here, cos(x/2) goes from positive to negative. So tan(2x) goes from -\u221e to +\u221e, crossing all real numbers. So there must be exactly one crossing here as well. Third solution.\n\nIn (5\u03c0/4, 7\u03c0/4): tan(2x) goes from -\u221e to +\u221e. Cos(x/2) starts at cos(5\u03c0/8) \u2248 -0.3827 and decreases to cos(7\u03c0/8) \u2248 -0.9239. So cos(x/2) is negative here. As tan(2x) goes from -\u221e to +\u221e, crossing all real numbers, and cos(x/2) is negative and decreasing. So there must be exactly one crossing here where tan(2x) equals the negative value of cos(x/2). Fourth solution.\n\nFinally, in (7\u03c0/4, 2\u03c0]: tan(2x) goes from -\u221e to 0 (since at x approaching 7\u03c0/4 from the right, 2x approaches 7\u03c0/2, which is equivalent to 7\u03c0/2 - 4\u03c0 = -\u03c0/2, so tan(-\u03c0/2 + \u03b5) approaches -\u221e, and at x=2\u03c0, 2x=4\u03c0, tan(4\u03c0)=0). So in this interval, tan(2x) increases from -\u221e to 0. Cos(x/2) starts at cos(7\u03c0/8) \u2248 -0.9239 and decreases to cos(\u03c0) = -1. So cos(x/2) is decreasing from -0.9239 to -1. So tan(2x) is increasing from -\u221e to 0, and cos(x/2) is decreasing from -0.9239 to -1. So they must cross exactly once here as well. Fifth solution.\n\nWait, but in the last interval (7\u03c0/4, 2\u03c0], tan(2x) is increasing from -\u221e to 0, and cos(x/2) is decreasing from -0.9239 to -1. So when does tan(2x) cross cos(x/2)? Let's see: At x approaching 7\u03c0/4 from the right, tan(2x) approaches -\u221e, which is less than cos(x/2) which is approaching -0.9239. As x approaches 2\u03c0, tan(2x) approaches 0, which is greater",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. We need to find three distinct positive integers I, M, and O such that their product is 2001, and we want the largest possible sum I + M + O. The answer choices suggest that the maximum is 671, but let's verify that.\n\nFirst, I remember that to maximize the sum of numbers with a fixed product, you want one number to be as large as possible while the others are as small as possible. Since they have to be distinct, the smallest possible numbers would be 1 and 1, but they can't be the same. So maybe 1 and 2? Let's check.\n\nBut wait, the product has to be 2001. Let's factorize 2001. Let me see, 2001 divided by 3 is 667. Then 667 divided by 23 is 29. So 2001 = 3 \u00d7 23 \u00d7 29. Are those primes? Let me confirm: 3 is prime, 23 is prime, 29 is prime. So the prime factorization is 3\u00d723\u00d729.\n\nNow, the factors of 2001 are combinations of these primes. Since we need three distinct integers, we can start by considering the factors. The trivial factors are 1, 3, 23, 29, 69 (3\u00d723), 87 (3\u00d729), 667 (23\u00d729), and 2001. But we need three distinct numbers. Let's list possible triplets:\n\nOption 1: 1, 3, 667 (since 1\u00d73\u00d7667=2001). Their sum is 1+3+667=671. That's one of the options, E.\n\nOption 2: 1, 23, 87 (1\u00d723\u00d787=2001). Sum is 1+23+87=111. That's option D.\n\nOption 3: 1, 29, 69. Sum is 1+29+69=99. Option C.\n\nOption 4: 3, 23, 29. Sum is 3+23+29=55. Option B.\n\nSo among these, 671 is the largest. But wait, are there other possible triplets? For example, using non-trivial factors. Let's see. Suppose we take 1, 1, 2001. But they have to be distinct, so that's invalid. Similarly, 1, 3, 667 is valid. What about other combinations? Let's check if there's a way to split the factors differently. For example, 3\u00d723=69, so 1, 69, 29. Wait, that's the same as 1,29,69. Sum 99. Or 3\u00d729=87, so 1,23,87. Sum 111. Alternatively, 23\u00d729=667, so 1,3,667. Sum 671. Are there any other triplet combinations?\n\nWhat if we take 3, 1, 667? That's the same as the first option. So the key here is that to maximize the sum, we need to have two numbers as small as possible (1 and 3) and the third as large as possible (667). Since 1\u00d73\u00d7667=2001, and they are distinct, this gives the maximum sum. The other options have smaller sums because the numbers are more balanced. For example, 3,23,29 are all in the middle range, leading to a smaller sum. So the answer should be 671, which is option E. The problem is making sure there are no other triplet combinations that we missed. But given the prime factors, all possible triplets are accounted for by combining the primes into two numbers and leaving the third as 1. Since 1 is the smallest possible, and the next smallest is 3, combining the other primes into the third number gives the maximum sum. Therefore, the largest possible sum is indeed 671.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo maximize the sum \\( I + M + O \\) where \\( I, M, O \\) are distinct positive integers and \\( I \\cdot M \\cdot O = 2001 \\), we need to distribute the factors of 2001 such that one number is as large as possible while the others are minimized. \n\nFirst, factorize 2001:  \n\\( 2001 = 3 \\times 23 \\times 29 \\).  \nThese are all primes. The distinct factors of 2001 include \\( 1, 3, 23, 29, 69, 87, 667, 2001 \\).\n\nTo maximize the sum, we use the smallest possible distinct factors for two numbers and let the third absorb the remaining product.

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The equation given is sin(\u03c0/2 cos x) = cos(\u03c0/2 sin x), and we need to find how many solutions exist in the interval [0, \u03c0]. The answer is supposed to be 2, so I need to figure out why that's the case.\n\nFirst, I remember that both sine and cosine functions have ranges between -1 and 1. But since x is in [0, \u03c0], let's consider the possible values of cos x and sin x in this interval. \n\nFor x in [0, \u03c0], cos x ranges from -1 to 1. Specifically, at x=0, cos x=1; at x=\u03c0/2, cos x=0; and at x=\u03c0, cos x=-1. Similarly, sin x in [0, \u03c0] ranges from 0 to 1. At x=0 and x=\u03c0, sin x=0, and at x=\u03c0/2, sin x=1.\n\nSo, let's look at the arguments inside the sine and cosine functions in the equation. The left side is sin(\u03c0/2 cos x), and the right side is cos(\u03c0/2 sin x). Let's analyze the possible values of these expressions.\n\nStarting with the left side: \u03c0/2 cos x. Since cos x ranges from -1 to 1 in [0, \u03c0], multiplying by \u03c0/2 gives us a range from -\u03c0/2 to \u03c0/2. Then, taking the sine of that, sin(\u03c0/2 cos x) will have a range from sin(-\u03c0/2) to sin(\u03c0/2), which is from -1 to 1. But since sine is an odd function, sin(-\u03b8) = -sin\u03b8, so the left side's range is [-1, 1]. However, since cos x is symmetric around \u03c0/2 in [0, \u03c0], maybe we can consider only non-negative values? Wait, cos x can be negative when x is in (\u03c0/2, \u03c0], so \u03c0/2 cos x can be negative there. But the sine function can handle negative arguments.\n\nOn the right side: \u03c0/2 sin x. Since sin x in [0, \u03c0] is between 0 and 1, \u03c0/2 sin x ranges from 0 to \u03c0/2. Then, cos(\u03c0/2 sin x) will range from cos(\u03c0/2) = 0 to cos(0) = 1. So the right side is between 0 and 1.\n\nWait, but the left side can be between -1 and 1, and the right side is between 0 and 1. So for the equation to hold, sin(\u03c0/2 cos x) must be non-negative because the right side is non-negative. Therefore, we can restrict our attention to x where sin(\u03c0/2 cos x) \u2265 0. When is sin(\u03b8) non-negative? When \u03b8 is in [0, \u03c0] (mod 2\u03c0), but since \u03b8 here is \u03c0/2 cos x, which ranges from -\u03c0/2 to \u03c0/2. So sin(\u03b8) is non-negative when \u03b8 is in [0, \u03c0/2], which corresponds to cos x \u2265 0. Because \u03c0/2 cos x \u2265 0 implies cos x \u2265 0. So cos x \u2265 0 occurs when x is in [0, \u03c0/2], since cos x is non-negative there. So the equation can only have solutions in x \u2208 [0, \u03c0/2], because for x in (\u03c0/2, \u03c0], cos x is negative, leading to sin(\u03c0/2 cos x) being negative, but the right side is non-negative. Therefore, solutions must lie in [0, \u03c0/2].\n\nSo now, we can restrict x to [0, \u03c0/2]. Let's redefine the problem to x in [0, \u03c0/2]. In this interval, cos x ranges from 1 to 0, so \u03c0/2 cos x ranges from \u03c0/2 to 0. Therefore, sin(\u03c0/2 cos x) ranges from sin(\u03c0/2) = 1 to sin(0) = 0. So the left side decreases from 1 to 0 as x goes from 0 to \u03c0/2.\n\nOn the right side, in x \u2208 [0, \u03c0/2], sin x ranges from 0 to 1, so \u03c0/2 sin x ranges from 0 to \u03c0/2. Then, cos(\u03c0/2 sin x) ranges from cos(0) = 1 to cos(\u03c0/2) = 0. So the right side also decreases from 1 to 0 as x goes from 0 to \u03c0/2.\n\nWait, both sides are decreasing from 1 to 0 on [0, \u03c0/2]. So maybe they cross each other somewhere in between? But how many times? The answer is supposed to be 2 solutions. Hmm, but if both functions are decreasing from 1 to 0, maybe they intersect once? But the answer is 2. So perhaps there's a point where they cross twice. Maybe the functions have different concavities, leading to two intersections.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's symmetry or a substitution that can be made. Let me think about possible substitutions.\n\nLet me set \u03b8 = x. Then, the equation is sin((\u03c0/2) cos \u03b8) = cos((\u03c0/2) sin \u03b8). Let's see if there's a trigonometric identity that can relate these. Remember that cos(\u03b1) = sin(\u03c0/2 - \u03b1). So, cos((\u03c0/2) sin \u03b8) = sin(\u03c0/2 - (\u03c0/2) sin \u03b8) = sin( (\u03c0/2)(1 - sin \u03b8) ). Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\nsin( (\u03c0/2) cos \u03b8 ) = sin( (\u03c0/2)(1 - sin \u03b8) )\n\nSo, sin A = sin B implies that A = B + 2\u03c0n or A = \u03c0 - B + 2\u03c0n for some integer n. But since \u03b8 is in [0, \u03c0/2], let's see what the possible values of A and B are.\n\nA = (\u03c0/2) cos \u03b8, which in [0, \u03c0/2], cos \u03b8 goes from 1 to 0, so A goes from \u03c0/2 to 0.\n\nB = (\u03c0/2)(1 - sin \u03b8), and since sin \u03b8 in [0, \u03c0/2] goes from 0 to 1, so B goes from \u03c0/2 to 0 as well. So both A and B are in [0, \u03c0/2]. Therefore, the solutions to sin A = sin B in this interval would be either A = B or A = \u03c0 - B. But since both A and B are in [0, \u03c0/2], \u03c0 - B would be in [\u03c0/2, \u03c0], which is outside the range of A. Therefore, the only possibility is A = B + 2\u03c0n or A = \u03c0 - B + 2\u03c0n. However, since A and B are both between 0 and \u03c0/2, the only possible case without considering n is A = B or A = \u03c0 - B. But \u03c0 - B would be greater than or equal to \u03c0/2 (since B \u2264 \u03c0/2), but A is \u2264 \u03c0/2, so A = \u03c0 - B would require A \u2265 \u03c0/2, which only happens when B \u2264 \u03c0/2. Wait, but if A is in [0, \u03c0/2], then \u03c0 - B would be in [\u03c0/2, \u03c0], which is outside of A's range. Therefore, the only possible solution is A = B. So, the equation reduces to (\u03c0/2) cos \u03b8 = (\u03c0/2)(1 - sin \u03b8), which simplifies to cos \u03b8 = 1 - sin \u03b8.\n\nSo, cos \u03b8 + sin \u03b8 = 1. Let's solve this equation in [0, \u03c0/2]. Let's square both sides to see if that helps, but we have to be careful about extraneous solutions.\n\n(cos \u03b8 + sin \u03b8)^2 = 1^2\n\ncos\u00b2\u03b8 + 2 sin \u03b8 cos \u03b8 + sin\u00b2\u03b8 = 1\n\n(cos\u00b2\u03b8 + sin\u00b2\u03b8) + 2 sin \u03b8 cos \u03b8 = 1\n\n1 + sin 2\u03b8 = 1\n\nsin 2\u03b8 = 0\n\nSo, sin 2\u03b8 = 0 implies 2\u03b8 = n\u03c0, \u03b8 = n\u03c0/2. But \u03b8 is in [0, \u03c0/2], so possible solutions are \u03b8 = 0, \u03c0/2. Let's check these in the original equation cos \u03b8 + sin \u03b8 = 1.\n\nAt \u03b8 = 0: cos 0 + sin 0 = 1 + 0 = 1. Correct.\n\nAt \u03b8 = \u03c0/2: cos(\u03c0/2) + sin(\u03c0/2) = 0 + 1 = 1. Correct.\n\nBut \u03b8 = \u03c0/2 is the upper bound of our interval [0, \u03c0/2]. Wait, but we restricted x to [0, \u03c0/2] because of the earlier reasoning. So, these are two solutions: x=0 and x=\u03c0/2. But wait, x=\u03c0/2 is in [0, \u03c0], so that's valid. However, we need to check if these solutions satisfy the original equation.\n\nLet's check x=0:\n\nLeft side: sin(\u03c0/2 cos 0) = sin(\u03c0/2 * 1) = sin(\u03c0/2) = 1\n\nRight side: cos(\u03c0/2 sin 0) = cos(0) = 1. So, 1=1. Valid.\n\nx=\u03c0/2:\n\nLeft side: sin(\u03c0/2 cos(\u03c0/2)) = sin(\u03c0/2 * 0) = sin(0) = 0\n\nRight side: cos(\u03c0/2 sin(\u03c0/2)) = cos(\u03c0/2 *1) = cos(\u03c0/2) = 0. So, 0=0. Valid.\n\nSo, these are two solutions. But the problem is asking for solutions in [0, \u03c0]. Wait, but earlier we restricted to [0, \u03c0/2] because for x in (\u03c0/2, \u03c0], cos x is negative, leading to sin(\u03c0/2 cos x) being negative, but the right side is non-negative. So, in (\u03c0/2, \u03c0], the left side is sin(\u03c0/2 cos x) where cos x is negative, so \u03c0/2 cos x is negative, and sin of a negative angle is negative. The right side is cos(\u03c0/2 sin x), which is non-negative because \u03c0/2 sin x is between 0 and \u03c0/2 (since sin x in [0,1] for x in [0, \u03c0]). Therefore, in (\u03c0/2, \u03c0], left side is negative, right side is non-negative, so no solutions there. Therefore, all solutions must be in [0, \u03c0/2], and we found two solutions: x=0 and x=\u03c0/2. But wait, the answer is supposed to be 2, which matches options C. But wait, the problem says \"closed interval [0, \u03c0]\", so including both endpoints. So x=0 and x=\u03c0/2 are both in [0, \u03c0], so that's two solutions. But wait, the answer is C) 2. So that's correct? But wait, maybe there's another solution in between?\n\nWait, when we solved cos \u03b8 + sin \u03b8 = 1, we found \u03b8=0 and \u03b8=\u03c0/2. But when we squared the equation, we might have introduced extraneous solutions. Let's check if there are other solutions in between.\n\nSuppose \u03b8 is in (0, \u03c0/2). Let's pick \u03b8=\u03c0/4. Then cos(\u03c0/4) + sin(\u03c0/4) = \u221a2/2 + \u221a2/2 = \u221a2 \u2248 1.414 > 1. So, cos \u03b8 + sin \u03b8 >1 in (0, \u03c0/2). Therefore, the equation cos \u03b8 + sin \u03b8 =1 only holds at \u03b8=0 and \u03b8=\u03c0/2. Therefore, in [0, \u03c0/2], only two solutions. Hence, in [0, \u03c0], only two solutions. Therefore, the answer is 2.\n\nBut wait, let me verify this again. Let's take another angle, say \u03b8=\u03c0/6. cos(\u03c0/6)=\u221a3/2 \u22480.866, sin(\u03c0/6)=0.5. Sum is \u22481.366 >1. So indeed, between 0 and \u03c0/2, the sum is greater than 1, so the equation cos \u03b8 + sin \u03b8 =1 only holds at the endpoints. Therefore, the only solutions are x=0 and x=\u03c0/2. But wait, x=\u03c0/2 is in [0, \u03c0], so that's two solutions. Therefore, the answer is 2. So option C.\n\nBut wait, the problem statement says \"closed interval [0, \u03c0]\" and the answer is C)2. So that's correct. But let me check if there are any other solutions. Suppose there's a case where sin A = cos B without A = B. Wait, but we transformed the equation into sin A = sin (\u03c0/2 - B), which led us to the equation. But maybe there's another approach.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider specific substitutions. Let me set u = cos x and v = sin x. But in [0, \u03c0/2], u and v are both non-negative, and u\u00b2 + v\u00b2 =1. But I'm not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, graph both sides of the equation in [0, \u03c0/2]. The left side, sin(\u03c0/2 cos x), starts at 1 when x=0 (cos x=1), decreases to sin(0)=0 at x=\u03c0/2. The right side, cos(\u03c0/2 sin x), starts at cos(0)=1 when x=0 (sin x=0), decreases to cos(\u03c0/2)=0 at x=\u03c0/2. So both functions start at 1 and decrease to 0. The question is, do they cross each other only at the endpoints, or do they cross somewhere in between?\n\nIf they only touch at the endpoints, then there are two solutions. But if they cross in between, there might be more. Wait, but we derived that the only solutions are the endpoints. But maybe there's a mistake here.\n\nWait, let's think again. When we transformed the equation to cos x + sin x =1, we assumed that the only solution comes from A = B. But maybe there's another case where sin A = sin B, which would be A = \u03c0 - B + 2\u03c0n. However, since A and B are both in [0, \u03c0/2], \u03c0 - B would be in [\u03c0/2, \u03c0], but A is in [0, \u03c0/2], so \u03c0 - B would be outside of A's range unless B=0. If B=0, then \u03c0 - B = \u03c0, which is still outside. Therefore, the only possible solution is A = B. Hence, the equation reduces to cos x + sin x =1, which only has solutions at x=0 and x=\u03c0/2.\n\nTherefore, the equation has exactly two solutions in [0, \u03c0]. Hence, the answer is C)2.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo determine the number of solutions to the equation \\(\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\cos x\\right) = \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\sin x\\right)\\) in \\([0, \\pi]\\), we analyze the behavior of both sides of the equation and exploit trigonometric identities.\n\n**Step 1: Restrict the domain for valid solutions**  \nFirst, observe that for \\(x \\in (\\pi/2, \\pi]\\), \\(\\cos x\\) is negative. This makes \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\cos x\\) negative, so \\(\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\cos x\\right)\\) becomes negative.

However, since \\(x \\in [0, \\pi/2]\\), the arguments of \\(\\sin\\) on both sides lie in \\([0, \\pi/2]\\), so only \\(A = B\\) is possible (as \\(\\pi - B\\) would exceed \\(\\pi/2\\)).\n\n**Step 3: Solve the reduced equation**  \nEquate the arguments:  \n\\[\n\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\cos x = \\frac{\\pi}{2}(1 - \\sin x) \\implies \\cos x = 1 - \\sin x.\n\\]  \nRearrange to:  \n\\[\n\\cos x + \\sin x = 1.\n\\]  \nSquare both sides (noting potential extraneous solutions):  \n\\[\n\\cos^2 x + 2 \\sin x \\cos x + \\sin^2 x = 1 \\implies 1 + \\sin 2x = 1 \\implies \\sin 2x = 0.\n\\]  \nThis gives \\(2x = n\\pi \\implies x = n\\pi/2\\).

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is to show that for positive real numbers a, b, c, d, the expression a\u00b2/b + b\u00b2/c + c\u00b2/d + d\u00b2/a is greater than or equal to a + b + c + d. Hmm. So, all variables are positive, which is important because we might be dealing with inequalities where positivity matters, like using AM-GM or Cauchy-Schwarz.\n\nFirst, I remember that inequalities involving fractions often use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or the AM-GM inequality. Let me think about each term. For example, a\u00b2/b is like (a squared) divided by b. Maybe if I can relate each term to a and b somehow.\n\nWait, Cauchy-Schwarz in the form of (sum x_i\u00b2)(sum y_i\u00b2) \u2265 (sum x_i y_i)\u00b2. But how to apply that here? Alternatively, maybe using the AM-GM inequality on each term. Let's see. The AM-GM inequality states that for non-negative numbers, the arithmetic mean is at least the geometric mean. So, for two positive numbers x and y, (x + y)/2 \u2265 sqrt(xy). But here, each term is a single fraction. Maybe if I pair terms or consider each term individually.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compare each term a\u00b2/b with a. If I can show that a\u00b2/b \u2265 something related to a, then summing them up might give the desired result. Let's take a\u00b2/b. Since a and b are positive, maybe I can write a\u00b2/b \u2265 k*a, where k is some constant. Let's solve for k. If a\u00b2/b \u2265 k*a, then dividing both sides by a (since a > 0), we get a/b \u2265 k. But k would need to be a constant that works for all terms. Hmm, maybe this approach isn't straightforward.\n\nWait, another idea: Maybe use the fact that for positive x and y, x\u00b2/y + y \u2265 2x. That's from AM-GM. Let's check: (x\u00b2/y + y)/2 \u2265 sqrt(x\u00b2/y * y) = x. So yes, x\u00b2/y + y \u2265 2x. But here, in our problem, each term is a\u00b2/b, but then we have other terms. Let's see. If I apply this to each term:\n\na\u00b2/b + b \u2265 2a (from AM-GM)\nb\u00b2/c + c \u2265 2b\nc\u00b2/d + d \u2265 2c\nd\u00b2/a + a \u2265 2d\n\nIf I add all these inequalities together, the left side becomes (a\u00b2/b + b\u00b2/c + c\u00b2/d + d\u00b2/a) + (b + c + d + a) \u2265 2(a + b + c + d). Then, subtracting (a + b + c + d) from both sides gives a\u00b2/b + b\u00b2/c + c\u00b2/d + d\u00b2/a \u2265 a + b + c + d. That seems to work! So the key was to apply the AM-GM inequality to each pair of terms and then sum them up.\n\nWait, let me verify each step. For the first term, a\u00b2/b + b \u2265 2a. By AM-GM, (a\u00b2/b + b)/2 \u2265 sqrt(a\u00b2/b * b) = sqrt(a\u00b2) = a. Multiply both sides by 2: a\u00b2/b + b \u2265 2a. Similarly for the other terms. Then adding all four inequalities:\n\n(a\u00b2/b + b) + (b\u00b2/c + c) + (c\u00b2/d + d) + (d\u00b2/a + a) \u2265 2a + 2b + 2c + 2d.\n\nThe left side simplifies to (a\u00b2/b + b\u00b2/c + c\u00b2/d + d\u00b2/a) + (a + b + c + d). Therefore, subtracting (a + b + c + d) from both sides gives the desired inequality. That makes sense. So the proof uses the AM-GM inequality on each pair of terms and then combines them. I think that's the right approach.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nLet's tackle the inequality \\( \\frac{a^2}{b} + \\frac{b^2}{c} + \\frac{c^2}{d} + \\frac{d^2}{a} \\geq a + b + c + d \\) for positive real numbers \\( a, b, c, d \\). \n\n**Key Insight:**  \nWe can apply the **Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean (AM-GM) Inequality** to pairs of terms in a clever way. Specifically, for any two positive real numbers \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), AM-GM tells us that \\( \\frac{x}{y} + y \\geq 2\\sqrt{\\frac{x}{y} \\cdot y} = 2\\sqrt{x} \\). However, we need a slightly different pairing to match the structure of our problem.\n\n**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**  \n1. **Apply AM-GM to each fraction and its \"neighbor\":**  \n   For the term \\( \\frac{a^2}{b} \\), pair it with \\( b \\). By AM-GM:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\frac{a^2}{b} + b}{2} \\geq \\sqrt{\\frac{a^2}{b} \\cdot b} = a.\n   \\]  \n   Multiplying through by 2 gives:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{a^2}{b} + b \\geq 2a.\n   \\]  \n\n   Similarly, apply this to the other terms:  \n   - \\( \\frac{b^2}{c} + c \\geq 2b \\),  \n   - \\( \\frac{c^2}{d} + d \\geq 2c \\),  \n   - \\( \\frac{d^2}{a} + a \\geq 2d \\).  \n\n2. **Sum all four inequalities:**  \n   Adding them together:  \n   \\[\n   \\left( \\frac{a^2}{b} + \\frac{b^2}{c} + \\frac{c^2}{d} + \\frac{d^2}{a} \\right) + (a + b + c + d) \\geq 2(a + b + c + d).\n   \\]  \n\n3. **Simplify the inequality:**  \n   Subtract \\( a + b + c + d \\) from both sides:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{a^2}{b} + \\frac{b^2}{c} + \\frac{c^2}{d} + \\frac{d^2}{a} \\geq a + b + c + d.\n   \\]  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nBy strategically applying AM-GM to each fraction and its corresponding \"denominator variable,\" we derive the desired inequality through summation and simplification. This method leverages the symmetry in the problem and the positivity of all variables to ensure the inequality holds.\nPrevious attempt failed with: linarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase a\na b c d : \u211d\nh\u2080 : 0 < a \u2227 0 < b \u2227 0 < c \u2227 0 < d\na\u271d : a + b + c + d > a ^ 2 / b + b ^ 2 / c + c ^ 2 / d + d ^ 2 / a\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: linarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase a\na b c d : \u211d\nh\u2080 : 0 < a \u2227 0 < b \u2227 0 < c \u2227 0 < d\nh1' : 0 < b\na\u271d : ?m.2251 * b > ?m.2252\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase a\na b c d : \u211d\nh\u2080 : 0 < a \u2227 0 < b \u2227 0 < c \u2227 0 < d\nh1 : a ^ 2 / b + b \u2265 2 * a\nh2' : 0 < c\na\u271d : ?m.4284 * c > ?m.4285\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase a\na b c d : \u211d\nh\u2080 : 0 < a \u2227 0 < b \u2227 0 < c \u2227 0 < d\nh1 : a ^ 2 / b + b \u2265 2 * a\nh2 : b ^ 2 / c + c \u2265 2 * b\nh3' : 0 < d\na\u271d : ?m.7108 * d > ?m.7109\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase a\na b c d : \u211d\nh\u2080 : 0 < a \u2227 0 < b \u2227 0 < c \u2227 0 < d\nh1 : a ^ 2 / b + b \u2265 2 * a\nh2 : b ^ 2 / c + c \u2265 2 * b\nh3 : c ^ 2 / d + d \u2265 2 * c\nh4' : 0 < a\na\u271d : ?m.10582 * a > ?m.10583\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: linarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase a\na b c d : \u211d\nh\u2080 : 0 < a \u2227 0 < b \u2227 0 < c \u2227 0 < d\nh1' : 0 < b\na\u271d : 2 * a > a ^ 2 / b + b\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase a\na b c d : \u211d\nh\u2080 : 0 < a \u2227 0 < b \u2227 0 < c \u2227 0 < d\nh1 : a ^ 2 / b + b \u2265 2 * a\nh2' : 0 < c\na\u271d : 2 * b > b ^ 2 / c + c\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase a\na b c d : \u211d\nh\u2080 : 0 < a \u2227 0 < b \u2227 0 < c \u2227 0 < d\nh1 : a ^ 2 / b + b \u2265 2 * a\nh2 : b ^ 2 / c + c \u2265 2 * b\nh3' : 0 < d\na\u271d : 2 * c > c ^ 2 / d + d\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase a\na b c d : \u211d\nh\u2080 : 0 < a \u2227 0 < b \u2227 0 < c \u2227 0 < d\nh1 : a ^ 2 / b + b \u2265 2 * a\nh2 : b ^ 2 / c + c \u2265 2 * b\nh3 : c ^ 2 / d + d \u2265 2 * c\nh4' : 0 < a\na\u271d : 2 * d > d ^ 2 / a + a\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the units digit of this big product: 16^17 times 17^18 times 18^19. And the answer is supposed to be 8. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the units digit of a product depends only on the units digits of the numbers being multiplied. So maybe I can find the units digit of each component separately and then multiply them together, taking the units digit of the result.\n\nLet's start with 16^17. The units digit of 16 is 6. I know that when you raise numbers ending in 6 to any power, the units digit remains 6. Like 6*6=36, units digit 6; 6*6*6=216, still 6. So 16^17 should have a units digit of 6. That part seems straightforward.\n\nNext, 17^18. The units digit here is 7. Now, powers of 7 cycle every 4. Let me check: 7^1=7, 7^2=49 (units digit 9), 7^3=343 (units digit 3), 7^4=2401 (units digit 1), then it repeats. So the cycle is 7, 9, 3, 1. Since the exponent here is 18, I can divide 18 by 4 to find the position in the cycle. 18 divided by 4 is 4 with a remainder of 2. So the second position in the cycle is 9. Therefore, 17^18 has a units digit of 9.\n\nThen, 18^19. The units digit is 8. Powers of 8 also cycle every 4: 8, 4, 2, 6. Let's verify: 8^1=8, 8^2=64 (4), 8^3=512 (2), 8^4=4096 (6), then repeats. The exponent here is 19. Dividing 19 by 4 gives 4 with a remainder of 3. The third position in the cycle is 2. So 18^19 has a units digit of 2.\n\nNow, multiply the three units digits together: 6 (from 16^17) * 9 (from 17^18) * 2 (from 18^19). Let's compute step by step. 6*9=54, units digit 4. Then 4*2=8. So the final units digit should be 8. That matches the answer we needed to show. But wait, let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 16^17: Yes, any power of 6 ends with 6. Correct.\n\nFor 17^18: The cycle is 4, exponent 18. 18 divided by 4 is 4 remainder 2. Second position is 9. Correct.\n\nFor 18^19: Cycle of 4, exponent 19. 19 divided by 4 is 4 remainder 3. Third position is 2. Correct.\n\nMultiplying 6*9=54 (units 4), then 4*2=8. Yes, that's right. So the units digit is indeed 8. I think that's solid. Maybe I should also consider using modular arithmetic to confirm, like modulo 10, since units digit is equivalent to mod 10.\n\nLet me try that approach. The units digit is the same as the number modulo 10. So compute each term modulo 10, multiply them, and take modulo 10 again.\n\n16 \u2261 6 mod 10, so 16^17 \u2261 6^17 mod 10. Since 6^n \u2261 6 mod 10 for any n \u2265 1, that's 6.\n\n17 \u2261 7 mod 10, so 17^18 \u2261 7^18 mod 10. The cycle for 7 is 4, so 18 mod 4 is 2. 7^2=49\u22619 mod10.\n\n18 \u22618 mod10, so 18^19\u22618^19 mod10. The cycle for 8 is 4, 19 mod4=3. 8^3=512\u22612 mod10.\n\nMultiply them: 6*9=54\u22614 mod10, then 4*2=8 mod10. Same result. So both methods confirm the units digit is 8. I think that's thorough enough. Maybe check one more example to be safe. Suppose exponents were different, but in this case, the reasoning holds.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo determine the units digit of \\(16^{17} \\times 17^{18} \\times 18^{19}\\), we analyze the units digit of each factor separately, as the units digit of a product depends only on the units digits of the multiplicands.\n\n1. **Units digit of \\(16^{17}\\):**  \n   The units digit of \\(16\\) is \\(6\\). For any power of a number ending in \\(6\\), the units digit remains \\(6\\). For example:  \n   - \\(6^1 = 6\\) (units digit \\(6\\)),  \n   - \\(6^2 = 36\\) (units digit \\(6\\)),  \n   - \\(6^3 = 216\\) (units digit \\(6\\)),  \n   and so on.  \n   Thus, \\(16^{17}\\) has a units digit of \\(6\\).\n\n2. **Units digit of \\(17^{18}\\):**  \n   The units digit of \\(17\\) is \\(7\\).

Powers of \\(8\\) cycle every \\(4\\) in their units digits:  \n   - \\(8^1 = 8\\) (units digit \\(8\\)),  \n   - \\(8^2 = 64\\) (units digit \\(4\\)),  \n   - \\(8^3 = 512\\) (units digit \\(2\\)),  \n   - \\(8^4 = 4096\\) (units digit \\(6\\)),  \n   and the cycle repeats.  \n   To find \\(8^{19}\\), divide the exponent \\(19\\) by the cycle length \\(4\\):  \n   \\(19 \\div 4 = 4\\) with a remainder of \\(3\\).  \n   The remainder \\(3\\) corresponds to the third position in the cycle (\\(2\\)).  \n   Therefore, \\(18^{19}\\) has a units digit of \\(2\\).\n\n4. **Combine the results:**  \n   Multiply the units digits of the three factors:  \n   \\[\n   6 \\, (\\text{from } 16^{17}) \\times 9 \\, (\\text{from } 17^{18}) \\times 2 \\, (\\text{from } 18^{19}).\n   \\]  \n   - First, \\(6 \\times 9 = 54\\), which has a units digit of \\(4\\).  \n   - Then, \\(4 \\times 2 = 8\\).  \n\n   Thus, the units digit of the entire product \\(16^{17} \\times 17^{18} \\times 18^{19}\\) is **8**.  \n   \nThis conclusion aligns with the problem\u2019s assertion, confirming the result.",

Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with congruences modulo a number, we can break down the problem by simplifying parts of the number step by step. Since 101 is a prime number, maybe some properties related to primes could help, but I'm not sure yet. Let's start by understanding what 123456 mod 101 really means. Essentially, I need to divide 123456 by 101 and find the remainder. The remainder should be n, which is 34 according to the problem. But calculating 123456 divided by 101 directly might be tedious. There must be a smarter way to break this down.\n\nI recall that modular arithmetic allows us to reduce large numbers by taking modulus at each step. So instead of computing 123456 mod 101 all at once, I can break 123456 into smaller parts. Let's see, 123456 is 123*1000 + 456. Wait, maybe breaking it into digits or smaller chunks would help. Alternatively, perhaps using powers of 10 modulo 101 since 10^k mod 101 might have a pattern.\n\nLet me think: 10^1 mod 101 is 10. 10^2 mod 101 is 100. 10^3 mod 101 is (10^2 * 10) mod 101 = (100 * 10) mod 101 = 1000 mod 101. Let's compute 1000 divided by 101. 101*9=909, so 1000-909=91. So 10^3 mod 101 is 91. Then 10^4 mod 101 would be (10^3 * 10) mod 101 = 91*10=910 mod 101. Let's do 910 divided by 101. 101*9=909, so 910-909=1. So 10^4 mod 101 is 1. Oh, that's interesting. So 10^4 \u2261 1 mod 101. That's a useful cycle. So every 4 exponents, it cycles back to 1. That could help break down the number 123456 into its digits multiplied by powers of 10, then reduce each power modulo 101 using this cycle.\n\nLet's try that approach. Let's write 123456 as a sum of its digits times powers of 10:\n\n123456 = 1*10^5 + 2*10^4 + 3*10^3 + 4*10^2 + 5*10^1 + 6*10^0\n\nNow, compute each term modulo 101.\n\nFirst, note that 10^4 \u2261 1 mod 101, so 10^5 = 10^4 * 10 \u2261 1 * 10 = 10 mod 101.\n\nSimilarly, 10^4 \u2261 1, so 10^4 remains 1. Then 10^3 \u2261 91 as we found earlier. 10^2 \u2261 100, 10^1 \u226110, and 10^0 \u22611.\n\nSo let's compute each term:\n\n1*10^5 \u2261 1*10 = 10 mod 101\n\n2*10^4 \u2261 2*1 = 2 mod 101\n\n3*10^3 \u2261 3*91 = 273 mod 101. Let's compute 273 divided by 101: 101*2=202, 273-202=71. So 273 \u226171 mod 101.\n\n4*10^2 \u22614*100=400 mod 101. 101*3=303, 400-303=97. So 400 \u226197 mod 101.\n\n5*10^1 \u22615*10=50 mod 101.\n\n6*10^0 \u22616*1=6 mod 101.\n\nNow add all these up:\n\n10 + 2 + 71 + 97 + 50 + 6.\n\nLet's compute step by step:\n\n10 + 2 =12\n\n12 +71=83\n\n83 +97=180\n\n180 +50=230\n\n230 +6=236\n\nNow, take 236 mod 101. Let's divide 236 by 101. 101*2=202, so 236-202=34. So 236 \u226134 mod 101.\n\nTherefore, 123456 \u226134 mod 101. That's the answer we wanted. Let me check if I did each step correctly.\n\nWait, let me verify the exponents again. For 10^5, since 10^4 \u22611, then 10^5 =10^4 *10 \u22611*10=10 mod101. Correct. Then 10^4 is 1, so 2*1=2. 10^3 was 91, so 3*91=273, which is 273-2*101=273-202=71. Correct. 10^2 is 100, so 4*100=400. 400-3*101=400-303=97. Correct. 5*10=50, 6*1=6. Adding all gives 10+2=12, +71=83, +97=180, +50=230, +6=236. 236 divided by 101 is 2*101=202, remainder 34. So yes, 236 mod101=34. So the final result is 34. That matches the problem's assertion.

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this age problem. So, the problem says that today, a father's age is five times his son's age. Exactly three years ago, the sum of their ages was 30. We need to find out how old the son is today and show that it's 6.\n\nHmm, let's start by setting up variables. Let me call the son's current age S. Then, since the father is five times as old, the father's current age would be 5S. That makes sense because if the son is, say, 6, the father would be 30, which fits the five times ratio.\n\nNow, three years ago, both of them were younger by three years. So the son's age three years ago would be S - 3, and the father's age would be 5S - 3. The problem states that the sum of their ages back then was 30. So, adding those two ages together should equal 30.\n\nLet me write that out as an equation: (S - 3) + (5S - 3) = 30. Combining like terms, S + 5S is 6S, and -3 -3 is -6. So the equation becomes 6S - 6 = 30. Then, adding 6 to both sides gives 6S = 36. Dividing both sides by 6, S = 6. So the son is 6 years old today.\n\nWait, let me check if that works. If the son is 6, the father is 5*6=30. Three years ago, the son was 3 and the father was 27. Their sum is 3 + 27 = 30, which matches the condition. Yep, that checks out. So the answer is indeed 6.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nLet's break down the problem step by step. Let \\( S \\) represent the son's current age. According to the first statement, the father's current age must then be \\( 5S \\) (since the father is five times as old as the son today).\n\nThree years ago, their ages would have been:\n- Son: \\( S - 3 \\)\n- Father: \\( 5S - 3 \\)\n\nThe problem states that the **sum** of their ages three years ago was 30. This gives us the equation:\n\\[\n(S - 3) + (5S - 3) = 30\n\\]\nSimplify the left side:\n\\[\nS + 5S - 3 - 3 = 30 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 6S - 6 = 30\n\\]\nAdd 6 to both sides:\n\\[\n6S = 36\n\\]\nDivide by 6:\n\\[\nS = 6\n\\]\n\n**Verification:**  \nIf the son is 6 today, the father is \\( 5 \\times 6 = 30 \\). Three years ago, the son was \\( 6 - 3 = 3 \\), and the father was \\( 30 - 3 = 27 \\). The sum \\( 3 + 27 = 30 \\) matches the given condition.

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to prove that for any real number x where x > -1 and any natural number n, the inequality (1 + nx) \u2264 (1 + x)^n holds. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst, I remember that inequalities involving exponents often use induction or maybe the Binomial Theorem. Since the problem mentions natural numbers n, induction might be a good path. Let me recall how mathematical induction works. You prove the base case, then assume it's true for some k and show it holds for k+1.\n\nLet's start with the base case, n=1. Plugging in, we get (1 + 1*x) \u2264 (1 + x)^1. Simplifying both sides, that's 1 + x \u2264 1 + x, which is equality. So the base case holds.\n\nNow, assume the inequality is true for some natural number k, so (1 + kx) \u2264 (1 + x)^k. We need to show that (1 + (k+1)x) \u2264 (1 + x)^{k+1}. Let's try to relate the k+1 case to the k case. \n\nStarting with the right-hand side, (1 + x)^{k+1} = (1 + x)^k * (1 + x). By the induction hypothesis, (1 + x)^k \u2265 1 + kx. So multiplying both sides by (1 + x), which is positive since x > -1 (so 1 + x > 0), gives (1 + x)^{k+1} \u2265 (1 + kx)(1 + x). \n\nExpanding the right-hand side: (1 + kx)(1 + x) = 1 + x + kx + kx^2 = 1 + (k + 1)x + kx^2. Since kx^2 is non-negative (because k is a natural number and x^2 is always non-negative), we have 1 + (k + 1)x + kx^2 \u2265 1 + (k + 1)x. Therefore, (1 + x)^{k+1} \u2265 1 + (k + 1)x. That completes the inductive step.\n\nWait, but what if x is negative? The problem states x > -1, so 1 + x is positive. But when x is negative, say between -1 and 0, does the induction step still hold? Let's check. If x is negative, then multiplying by (1 + x) would be multiplying by a positive number less than 1. But the induction step relies on (1 + x) being positive, which it is, and the expansion still includes the kx^2 term, which is non-negative even if x is negative. So the step where we say that 1 + (k + 1)x + kx^2 \u2265 1 + (k + 1)x still holds because kx^2 is non-negative. So even if x is negative, as long as x > -1, the inductive step works.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another approach using the Binomial Theorem. Let's expand (1 + x)^n. The Binomial Theorem says (1 + x)^n = 1 + nx + (n(n-1)/2)x^2 + ... + x^n. Since x > -1, and n is a natural number, all terms after nx are non-negative if x is non-negative. But if x is negative, some terms might be negative. Wait, but if x is between -1 and 0, then x^2 is positive, x^3 is negative, etc. Hmm, maybe this complicates things. However, the induction approach seems more straightforward and covers all cases where x > -1.\n\nAnother thought: Bernoulli's Inequality states that for any real number x \u2265 -1 and integer n \u2265 0, (1 + x)^n \u2265 1 + nx. Wait, that's exactly the inequality we're supposed to prove! So maybe this is Bernoulli's Inequality, and the standard proof uses induction. So the problem is essentially asking to prove Bernoulli's Inequality, which is typically done via induction as I started earlier.\n\nSo, to recap, the induction approach works. The base case n=1 holds. Assume true for n=k, then show for n=k+1. The key step is expanding (1 + x)^{k+1} as (1 + x)^k (1 + x) \u2265 (1 + kx)(1 + x), then expanding and noting that the extra term kx^2 makes the RHS larger than 1 + (k+1)x. Therefore, the inequality holds for all natural numbers n and x > -1.\n\nI should also check edge cases. For example, when x = 0, the inequality becomes 1 \u2264 1, which is true. If x = -0.5 (which is allowed since x > -1), then for n=2, (1 + 2*(-0.5)) = 0, and (1 + (-0.5))^2 = 0.25, so 0 \u2264 0.25 holds. For n=3, (1 + 3*(-0.5)) = -0.5, but (1 + (-0.5))^3 = 0.125. Wait, but here the left side is negative and the right side is positive, so -0.5 \u2264 0.125, which is true. So even when x is negative, the inequality holds. \n\nAnother example: x = -0.9, n=1. Then 1 + (-0.9) = 0.1 \u2264 (1 - 0.9)^1 = 0.1, equality holds. For n=2, left side is 1 + 2*(-0.9) = -0.8, right side is (0.1)^2 = 0.01. So -0.8 \u2264 0.01, which is true. So the inequality holds even when the left side is negative, as long as x > -1.\n\nTherefore, the induction proof works for all x > -1 and natural numbers n.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nLet's prove by mathematical induction that for any real number \\( x > -1 \\) and any natural number \\( n \\), the inequality \\( (1 + nx) \\leq (1 + x)^n \\) holds.\n\n**Base Case (\\( n = 1 \\)):**  \nFor \\( n = 1 \\), the inequality becomes \\( 1 + 1 \\cdot x \\leq (1 + x)^1 \\). Simplifying both sides, we get \\( 1 + x \\leq 1 + x \\), which is true. Thus, the base case holds.\n\n**Inductive Step:**  \nAssume the inequality holds for some natural number \\( k \\), i.e.,  \n\\( (1 + kx) \\leq (1 + x)^k \\).  \nWe need to show it holds for \\( k + 1 \\), i.e.,  \n\\( 1 + (k + 1)x \\leq (1 + x)^{k + 1} \\).\n\nStarting with the right-hand side of the target inequality:  \n\\[\n(1 + x)^{k + 1} = (1 + x)^k \\cdot (1 + x).\n\\]  \nBy the induction hypothesis, \\( (1 + x)^k \\geq 1 + kx \\). Since \\( x > -1 \\), \\( 1 + x > 0 \\), so multiplying both sides of the inequality by \\( 1 + x \\) preserves the inequality:  \n\\[\n(1 + x)^{k + 1} \\geq (1 + kx)(1 + x).\n\\]  \nExpanding the right-hand side:  \n\\[\n(1 + kx)(1 + x) = 1 + x + kx + kx^2 = 1 + (k + 1)x + kx^2.\n\\]  \nNotice that \\( kx^2 \\geq 0 \\) because \\( k \\) is a natural number and \\( x^2 \\geq 0 \\) for all real \\( x \\). Thus:  \n\\[\n1 + (k + 1)x + kx^2 \\geq 1 + (k + 1)x.\n\\]  \nCombining these results:  \n\\[\n(1 + x)^{k + 1} \\geq 1 + (k + 1)x.\n\\]  \nThis completes the inductive step.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nBy mathematical induction, the inequality \\( (1 + nx) \\leq (1 + x)^n \\) holds for all natural numbers \\( n \\) and all real numbers \\( x > -1 \\). The key idea is that the inductive step leverages the non-negativity of \\( kx^2 \\), ensuring the inequality strengthens as \\( n \\) increases. Even if \\( x \\) is negative (but \\( > -1 \\)), the quadratic term \\( kx^2 \\) compensates for potential decreases in the linear term, preserving the inequality.\nPrevious attempt failed with: linarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase succ.succ.a\nx : \u211d\nh\u2080 : -1 < x\nn : \u2115\nih : 1 + (x * \u2191n + x) \u2264 (1 + x) ^ n + x * (1 + x) ^ n\nh\u2081 : True\na\u271d : 1 + (x * \u2191n + x + x) > (1 + x) ^ n + x * (1 + x) ^ n + (x * (1 + x) ^ n + x * (x * (1 + x) ^ n))\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: linarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase succ.succ.a\nx : \u211d\nh\u2080 : -1 < x\nn : \u2115\nh\u2081 : 0 < n + 1 + 1\nih : 1 + (x * \u2191n + x) \u2264 (1 + x) ^ n + x * (1 + x) ^ n\na\u271d : 1 + (x * \u2191n + x + x) > (1 + x) ^ n + x * (1 + x) ^ n + (x * (1 + x) ^ n + x * (x * (1 + x) ^ n))\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: linarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase succ.succ.a\nx : \u211d\nh\u2080 : -1 < x\nn : \u2115\nih : 1 + (x * \u2191n + x) \u2264 (1 + x) ^ n + x * (1 + x) ^ n\nh\u2081 : True\na\u271d : 1 + (x * \u2191n + x + x) > (1 + x) ^ n + x * (1 + x) ^ n + (x * (1 + x) ^ n + x * (x * (1 + x) ^ n))\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nPlease revise the proof.",

We need to find the value of c and show that it's 3.\n\nFirst, I remember that evaluating a function at a specific point means substituting the input value into all instances of x in the function's expression. So, if we plug x = 2 into f(x), every x in the equation should be replaced with 2. That should let us solve for c because we know the result should equal 9.\n\nLet me write that out. Substituting x = 2 into f(x):\n\nf(2) = c*(2)\u00b3 - 9*(2) + 3.\n\nCalculating each term separately to avoid mistakes. The cube of 2 is 8, so the first term becomes 8c. The second term is 9 times 2, which is 18. The third term is just 3. So putting it all together:\n\n8c - 18 + 3 = 9.\n\nWait, combining the constants: -18 + 3 is -15. So the equation simplifies to:\n\n8c - 15 = 9.\n\nNow, to solve for c, we can add 15 to both sides:\n\n8c = 9 + 15 \u2192 8c = 24.\n\nThen divide both sides by 8:\n\nc = 24 / 8 = 3.\n\nSo that gives c = 3.

The theorem from the context says that 1/log_x y = log_y x. That reciprocal relationship might be useful. Let me recall the change of base formula: log_b a = log_c a / log_c b. So, log_y16 can be written as log\u208216 / log\u2082y. Let me check that. Yes, because log_y16 = (log\u208216)/(log\u2082y). \n\nSo substituting that into the first equation: log\u2082x = (log\u208216)/(log\u2082y). Let's compute log\u208216. Since 16 is 2^4, log\u208216 is 4. So the equation becomes log\u2082x = 4 / log\u2082y. Let me denote log\u2082x as a and log\u2082y as b to simplify things. Then, a = 4 / b. Also, since xy = 64, and x and y are in terms of base 2, maybe I can express x and y as powers of 2. Let's see: x = 2^a and y = 2^b. Then, xy = 2^a * 2^b = 2^(a + b) = 64. But 64 is 2^6, so a + b = 6. \n\nNow we have two equations: a = 4 / b and a + b = 6. Let's substitute the first into the second. So, 4/b + b = 6. Multiply both sides by b to eliminate the denominator: 4 + b\u00b2 = 6b. Rearranging gives b\u00b2 - 6b + 4 = 0. This is a quadratic equation. Let's solve for b using the quadratic formula: b = [6 \u00b1 sqrt(36 - 16)] / 2 = [6 \u00b1 sqrt(20)] / 2. Simplify sqrt(20) to 2*sqrt(5), so b = [6 \u00b1 2\u221a5]/2 = 3 \u00b1 \u221a5. \n\nTherefore, b (which is log\u2082y) can be 3 + \u221a5 or 3 - \u221a5. Then, a (log\u2082x) would be 4 / b. Let's compute a for both cases. If b = 3 + \u221a5, then a = 4 / (3 + \u221a5). To rationalize the denominator, multiply numerator and denominator by (3 - \u221a5): a = [4*(3 - \u221a5)] / [(3 + \u221a5)(3 - \u221a5)] = [12 - 4\u221a5]/(9 - 5) = (12 - 4\u221a5)/4 = 3 - \u221a5. Similarly, if b = 3 - \u221a5, then a = 4 / (3 - \u221a5). Rationalizing gives [4*(3 + \u221a5)]/(9 - 5) = (12 + 4\u221a5)/4 = 3 + \u221a5. \n\nSo, the pairs (a, b) are (3 - \u221a5, 3 + \u221a5) and (3 + \u221a5, 3 - \u221a5). Now, we need to find log\u2082(x/y). Since x = 2^a and y = 2^b, x/y = 2^(a - b). Therefore, log\u2082(x/y) = a - b. Let's compute this for both cases. \n\nFirst case: a = 3 - \u221a5 and b = 3 + \u221a5. Then a - b = (3 - \u221a5) - (3 + \u221a5) = -2\u221a5. Squaring this gives (-2\u221a5)\u00b2 = 4*5 = 20. Second case: a = 3 + \u221a5 and b = 3 - \u221a5. Then a - b = (3 + \u221a5) - (3 - \u221a5) = 2\u221a5. Squaring this also gives (2\u221a5)\u00b2 = 20. So in both cases, the square is 20. Therefore, the answer is 20, which corresponds to option B.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nLet's start by translating the given equations into more manageable forms.

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to show that for any natural number n, 11 divides 10^n minus (-1)^n. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this. Maybe using modulo arithmetic like in the example provided. The example used congruence properties, breaking down exponents and simplifying modulo 11. Let me try something similar here.\n\nFirst, let's understand what it means for 11 to divide 10^n - (-1)^n. That means when we divide 10^n - (-1)^n by 11, there's no remainder. In other words, 10^n \u2261 (-1)^n mod 11. So if I can show that 10^n is congruent to (-1)^n modulo 11, then the original statement holds.\n\nLet me check for small values of n to see if the pattern holds. For n=1: 10^1 - (-1)^1 = 10 +1 =11, which is divisible by 11. For n=2: 10^2 - (-1)^2 =100 -1=99, which is 9*11, so yes. For n=3: 1000 - (-1)^3=1000 +1=1001. 1001 divided by 11 is 91, so that works too. Okay, so the base cases check out.\n\nNow, how to generalize this. Let's express 10 in terms of modulo 11. Since 10 is one less than 11, 10 \u2261 -1 mod 11. That's a key observation. So 10 \u2261 -1 mod 11. Then, raising both sides to the power of n, using the congruence of powers property, we get 10^n \u2261 (-1)^n mod 11. \n\nWait, that seems straightforward. If 10 \u2261 -1 mod 11, then 10^n \u2261 (-1)^n mod 11. Therefore, 10^n - (-1)^n \u2261 0 mod 11, which means 11 divides 10^n - (-1)^n. \n\nBut maybe I should elaborate more to make it clear. Let's break it down step by step. Start by noting that 10 and -1 are congruent modulo 11. Then, using the property that if a \u2261 b mod m, then a^n \u2261 b^n mod m, apply this to 10 and -1. Therefore, 10^n \u2261 (-1)^n mod 11. Subtracting (-1)^n from both sides gives 10^n - (-1)^n \u2261 0 mod 11, which implies that 11 divides the difference. \n\nI should also mention why 10 \u2261 -1 mod 11. Since 10 +1 =11, which is a multiple of 11, so 10 \u2261 -1 mod 11. That's the basic congruence here. Then, the rest follows from the properties of exponents in modular arithmetic. \n\nMaybe to make it even clearer, I can write out the steps explicitly:\n\n1. Show that 10 \u2261 -1 mod 11.\n2. Raise both sides to the power of n, resulting in 10^n \u2261 (-1)^n mod 11.\n3. Subtract (-1)^n from both sides: 10^n - (-1)^n \u2261 0 mod 11.\n4. Therefore, 11 divides 10^n - (-1)^n.\n\nThis seems to cover the necessary steps. I should check if there's any edge case or if the properties used are valid. The congruence of powers is valid here because 10 and -1 are congruent modulo 11, and exponentiation preserves congruence. Also, subtraction in modular arithmetic is well-defined, so subtracting the same term on both sides maintains the congruence.\n\nAnother way to think about it is using mathematical induction. Let's see if that approach works. For n=1, as checked earlier, it's true. Assume it's true for n=k, i.e., 11 divides 10^k - (-1)^k. Then for n=k+1, 10^(k+1) - (-1)^(k+1) =10*10^k + (-1)^k. Using the induction hypothesis, 10^k \u2261 (-1)^k mod 11. Multiply both sides by 10: 10^(k+1) \u226110*(-1)^k mod 11. But 10 \u2261 -1 mod 11, so 10*(-1)^k \u2261 (-1)*(-1)^k = (-1)^(k+1) mod 11. Therefore, 10^(k+1) \u2261 (-1)^(k+1) mod 11, which implies 10^(k+1) - (-1)^(k+1) \u22610 mod 11. Hence, by induction, the statement holds for all natural numbers n.\n\nBut the first approach using direct congruence seems simpler and more straightforward. The induction method also works but might be more involved. Since the problem doesn't specify the method, either approach is valid, but the congruence method is more concise.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the key steps are recognizing the congruence of 10 and -1 modulo 11, applying the power property, and then subtracting to show the difference is a multiple of 11.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo show that 11 divides \\(10^n - (-1)^n\\) for any natural number \\(n\\), we can use properties of modular arithmetic. \n\nFirst, observe that \\(10\\) and \\(-1\\) are congruent modulo \\(11\\) because \\(10 - (-1) = 11\\), which is a multiple of \\(11\\).

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to prove that for nonnegative real numbers a\u2081, a\u2082, ..., a\u2099 where their sum is n, the product of all a_i is at most 1. Hmm. So the sum is fixed at n, and we want to maximize the product under this constraint. \n\nWait, this reminds me of the AM-GM inequality. The Arithmetic Mean - Geometric Mean inequality states that for non-negative numbers, the arithmetic mean is at least the geometric mean. And equality holds when all numbers are equal. Let me recall: for numbers a\u2081, a\u2082, ..., a\u2099, the AM is (a\u2081 + a\u2082 + ... + a\u2099)/n, and the GM is (a\u2081a\u2082...a\u2099)^(1/n). So AM \u2265 GM.\n\nIn this problem, the sum of the a_i's is n, so the arithmetic mean would be (sum)/n = n/n = 1. According to AM-GM, the geometric mean is less than or equal to 1. So GM = (a\u2081a\u2082...a\u2099)^(1/n) \u2264 1. If I raise both sides to the nth power, that gives a\u2081a\u2082...a\u2099 \u2264 1^n = 1. Exactly what we need to prove. \n\nBut wait, the problem states that the a_i are nonnegative. AM-GM requires non-negative numbers, which is satisfied here. Also, equality in AM-GM occurs when all the numbers are equal. So in this case, if all a_i = 1, then their sum is n, and the product is 1. That's the maximum possible product. If any a_i deviates from 1, the product would decrease. \n\nLet me check if there's any case where the product could be larger. Suppose one a_i is greater than 1. Then, since the sum is fixed at n, at least one other a_j must be less than 1. For example, if a\u2081 = 2, then the remaining a\u2082 + ... + a\u2099 = n - 2. But the product would be 2 multiplied by the product of the rest. However, the product of numbers that sum to n - 2 (with n-1 terms) would be maximized when all those terms are equal, so each would be (n - 2)/(n - 1). Then the product would be 2 * [(n - 2)/(n - 1)]^{n-1}. Comparing this to 1, is this product larger? Let's take n=3. Then sum is 3. If a\u2081=2, then a\u2082 + a\u2083 =1. Their maximum product is (0.5)(0.5)=0.25. So total product is 2*0.25=0.5 <1. So even if one term is larger, the others being smaller brings the product down. \n\nAnother example: n=2. Sum is 2. If a\u2081=1.5, a\u2082=0.5. Product is 0.75 <1. If both are 1, product is 1. So yes, the maximum is achieved when all are equal. \n\nTherefore, applying AM-GM directly gives the result. The key step is recognizing the constraint sum equals n and applying the inequality. The maximum product occurs at equality when all variables are 1, hence product is 1. Any deviation reduces the product. So the proof should be straightforward using AM-GM.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nLet's consider the problem where we have nonnegative real numbers \\( a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n \\) such that their sum is \\( n \\), and we want to show that their product \\( \\prod_{i=1}^n a_i \\) is at most \\( 1 \\).\n\nThe key insight here is to use the **Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean Inequality (AM-GM)**. This inequality states that for any nonnegative real numbers, the arithmetic mean is always greater than or equal to the geometric mean, with equality if and only if all the numbers are equal.\n\nHere's how we apply it:\n\n1. **Compute the arithmetic mean (AM):**  \n   The arithmetic mean of \\( a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n \\) is:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{AM} = \\frac{a_1 + a_2 + \\cdots + a_n}{n}.\n   \\]  \n   Since the sum \\( a_1 + a_2 + \\cdots + a_n = n \\), this simplifies to:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{AM} = \\frac{n}{n} = 1.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Apply the AM-GM inequality:**  \n   The geometric mean (GM) of the numbers is:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{GM} = \\left( a_1 a_2 \\cdots a_n \\right)^{1/n}.\n   \\]  \n   By AM-GM, we know \\( \\text{AM} \\geq \\text{GM} \\). Substituting the values:  \n   \\[\n   1 \\geq \\left( a_1 a_2 \\cdots a_n \\right)^{1/n}.\n   \\]  \n\n3. **Solve for the product:**  \n   Raise both sides of the inequality to the power of \\( n \\):  \n   \\[\n   1^n \\geq a_1 a_2 \\cdots a_n \\quad \\implies \\quad 1 \\geq \\prod_{i=1}^n a_i.\n   \\]  \n\n4. **Equality condition:**  \n   Equality in AM-GM occurs precisely when all \\( a_i \\) are equal. In this case, since the sum is \\( n \\), equality holds when every \\( a_i = 1 \\). This gives the maximum possible product \\( 1 \\times 1 \\times \\cdots \\times 1 = 1 \\).\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAny deviation from \\( a_i = 1 \\) for some \\( i \\) (while maintaining the sum \\( n \\)) will result in a smaller product. Thus, the product \\( \\prod_{i=1}^n a_i \\) cannot exceed \\( 1 \\), and the bound is achieved exactly when all \\( a_i = 1 \\). This completes the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown constant 'NNReal.arith_mean_le_geom_mean'\nunsolved goals\na : \u2115 \u2192 NNReal\nn : \u2115\nh\u2080 : \u2211 x \u2208 Finset.range n, a x = \u2191n\nh\u2081 : (\u220f x \u2208 Finset.range n, a x) ^ (1 / n) \u2264 \u2191n / \u2191n\n\u22a2 0 \u2264 ?m.5844\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown constant 'NNReal.arith_mean_le_geom_mean'\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  ?m.6794 \u2264 ?m.6795\na : \u2115 \u2192 NNReal\nn : \u2115\nh\u2080 : \u2211 x \u2208 Finset.range n, a x = \u2191n\nh\u2081 : (\u220f x \u2208 Finset.range n, a x) ^ (\u2191n)\u207b\u00b9 \u2264 \u2191n / \u2191n\n\u22a2 \u220f x \u2208 Finset.range n, a x \u2264 1\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown constant 'NNReal.arith_mean_le_geom_mean'\ntype mismatch\n  h\u2081\nhas type\n  (\u220f x \u2208 Finset.range n, a x) ^ (\u2191n)\u207b\u00b9 \u2264 \u2191n / \u2191n : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u220f x \u2208 Finset.range n, a x \u2264 1 : Prop\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. We need to show that there's exactly one starting value x\u2081 such that the sequence defined by x_{n+1} = x_n (x_n + 1/n) stays strictly between 0 and 1, and each term is larger than the previous one for all n. \n\nFirst, let's understand the sequence's behavior. The recursion is x_{n+1} = x_n\u00b2 + (x_n)/n. Since each term depends on the square of the previous term and a term that diminishes as n increases, maybe there's a balance here. The condition 0 < x_n < x_{n+1} < 1 for all n means the sequence is strictly increasing and bounded above by 1. So, if such a sequence exists, it should converge to a limit \u22641. But since it's increasing and bounded, it must converge. Let's think about the possible limit.\n\nSuppose the sequence converges to L. Then taking limits on both sides of the recursion, we get L = L\u00b2 + 0 (since 1/n approaches 0). So L\u00b2 - L = 0 \u2192 L(L - 1) = 0. Thus, L=0 or L=1. But the sequence is increasing and starts above 0, so if it converges to 0, that's impossible because it's increasing. Therefore, the only possible limit is 1. But wait, if the sequence is approaching 1, but each term is strictly less than 1, then maybe the sequence is approaching 1 from below. However, the problem states that all terms must be less than 1. So the limit would have to be 1, but the terms never reach 1. That seems plausible.\n\nBut how does the starting value x\u2081 affect this? We need to find the unique x\u2081 that makes the entire sequence stay in (0,1) and keep increasing. Let's consider the recursion again: x_{n+1} = x_n\u00b2 + x_n/n. For the sequence to be increasing, x_{n+1} > x_n. So x_n\u00b2 + x_n/n > x_n \u2192 x_n\u00b2 + x_n/n - x_n > 0 \u2192 x_n\u00b2 - x_n(1 - 1/n) > 0. Let's factor x_n: x_n (x_n - (1 - 1/n)) > 0. Since x_n is positive, this inequality holds if x_n > 1 - 1/n. Wait, but if x_n > 1 - 1/n, then x_{n+1} would be x_n\u00b2 + x_n/n. But if x_n is approaching 1, then x_{n}\u00b2 approaches 1, and x_n/n approaches 0, so x_{n+1} approaches 1. But we need x_{n+1} < 1. Hmm, maybe this approach isn't directly helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model the sequence's growth. Let's think recursively. For each n, x_{n+1} = x_n (x_n + 1/n). To ensure x_{n+1} < 1, we need x_n (x_n + 1/n) < 1. Let's solve for x_n: x_n\u00b2 + (x_n)/n < 1. This is a quadratic inequality in x_n. Let's rearrange it: x_n\u00b2 + (x_n)/n - 1 < 0. The roots of the equation x\u00b2 + x/n -1 =0 can be found using quadratic formula: x = [-1/(2n) \u00b1 sqrt(1/(4n\u00b2) +4)]/2. Since x_n is positive, we take the positive root: x = [ -1/(2n) + sqrt(1/(4n\u00b2) +4) ] / 2. Wait, maybe simplifying: sqrt(1/(4n\u00b2) +4) = sqrt( (1 + 16n\u00b2)/(4n\u00b2) ) ) = sqrt(1 +16n\u00b2)/(2n). So the positive root is [ -1/(2n) + sqrt(1 +16n\u00b2)/(2n) ] / 2. Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, since we need x_{n} (x_n + 1/n) <1, and x_n >0, perhaps we can find an upper bound for x_n. Let's suppose that x_n is approaching 1, so for large n, 1/n is small. But for the initial terms, 1/n is larger. Maybe the sequence needs to be carefully tuned so that each term is just enough to keep the next term under 1 but still increasing.\n\nThe problem states that there's exactly one x\u2081 that satisfies this. So perhaps we can model this as a telescoping product or find a recursive relation that defines x\u2081 uniquely. Let's consider building the sequence backwards. Suppose we want x_n approaching 1 as n increases. Let's assume that for large n, x_n \u22481 - \u03b5_n, where \u03b5_n is small. Then x_{n+1} \u2248 (1 - \u03b5_n)(1 - \u03b5_n + 1/n) \u2248 (1 - \u03b5_n)(1 + 1/n - \u03b5_n). Expanding this gives approximately 1 +1/n - \u03b5_n - \u03b5_n/n - \u03b5_n + ... Hmm, maybe this isn't helpful. Alternatively, maybe for the sequence to stay below 1 and increase, each term must satisfy x_{n+1} = x_n\u00b2 + x_n/n <1, and x_{n+1} >x_n.\n\nSo, for each n, x_n must satisfy x_n < [ -1/(2n) + sqrt(1/(4n\u00b2) +4) ] / 2. Wait, the positive root of x\u00b2 +x/n -1=0 is [ -1/(2n) + sqrt(1/(4n\u00b2) +4) ] / 2. Let's denote this root as a_n. Then, for x_n to satisfy x_n\u00b2 +x_n/n <1, x_n must be less than a_n. But since the sequence is increasing, each x_n must be less than a_n, and x_{n+1} must also be less than a_{n+1}. This seems like a recursive condition on x\u2081. Maybe the only x\u2081 that satisfies all these conditions for all n is a specific value.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sequence can be expressed in terms of x\u2081 by unfolding the recursion. Let's try to write x_{n} in terms of x\u2081. For example:\n\nx\u2082 = x\u2081(x\u2081 + 1/1)\n\nx\u2083 = x\u2082(x\u2082 + 1/2) = x\u2081(x\u2081 +1) [x\u2081(x\u2081 +1) +1/2]\n\nThis quickly becomes complicated. It's not clear how to express x_n in closed form. So maybe another approach is needed.\n\nLooking at the context provided (the example with x_{n+1} = 2/(x_n +1)), the proof there used induction to show that odd and even terms alternate between intervals and then considered the difference between terms two steps apart. Maybe a similar approach can work here. Let's see.\n\nFirst, we need to show that there's a unique x\u2081 such that the entire sequence stays in (0,1) and is increasing. Let's consider that for the sequence to be increasing, each x_{n+1} = x_n(x_n +1/n) must be greater than x_n. So x_n(x_n +1/n) >x_n \u2192 x_n +1/n >1 (since x_n >0). Wait, but x_n +1/n >1 would imply x_n >1 -1/n. But if x_n >1 -1/n, then x_{n+1} =x_n(x_n +1/n) > (1 -1/n)(1 -1/n +1/n) = (1 -1/n)(1) =1 -1/n. But we need x_{n+1} <1. So this seems contradictory. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let's re-examine the condition for x_{n+1} >x_n. Starting with x_{n+1} =x_n\u00b2 +x_n/n >x_n. Subtract x_n: x_n\u00b2 +x_n/n -x_n >0 \u2192 x_n\u00b2 -x_n(1 -1/n) >0 \u2192 x_n(x_n - (1 -1/n)) >0. Since x_n >0, this implies x_n >1 -1/n. So for the sequence to be increasing, each term x_n must be greater than 1 -1/n. But we also need x_{n+1} <1. So substituting x_n >1 -1/n into x_{n+1} =x_n\u00b2 +x_n/n, we get x_{n+1} > (1 -1/n)^2 + (1 -1/n)/n. Let's compute this:\n\n(1 -2/n +1/n\u00b2) + (1/n -1/n\u00b2) =1 -2/n +1/n\u00b2 +1/n -1/n\u00b2 =1 -1/n. So x_{n+1} >1 -1/n. But we need x_{n+1} <1. So combining these, x_{n+1} must be in (1 -1/n,1). Similarly, x_{n} must be in (1 -1/(n-1),1) for the previous term. Wait, this seems like a recursive condition that tightens as n increases.\n\nFor example, for n=1: x\u2082 =x\u2081(x\u2081 +1). We need x\u2082 >x\u2081 and x\u2082 <1. So x\u2081(x\u2081 +1) >x\u2081 \u2192 x\u2081 +1 >1 (since x\u2081 >0) \u2192 x\u2081 >0, which is already given. But x\u2081(x\u2081 +1) <1 \u2192 x\u2081\u00b2 +x\u2081 -1 <0. Solving x\u2081\u00b2 +x\u2081 -1=0 gives roots [-1 \u00b1\u221a5]/2. The positive root is (\u221a5 -1)/2 \u22480.618. So x\u2081 must be less than this to have x\u2082 <1. But also, since the sequence must be increasing, x\u2082 >x\u2081. So x\u2081 must be in (0, (\u221a5 -1)/2) to satisfy x\u2082 \u2208(x\u2081,1). But wait, but for n=1, the condition x_n >1 -1/n would be x\u2081 >1 -1/1=0, which is already satisfied. But the real condition from the recursion is x\u2081\u00b2 +x\u2081 -1 <0 \u2192 x\u2081 < (\u221a5 -1)/2 \u22480.618. So x\u2081 must be in (0, (\u221a5 -1)/2) to have x\u2082 <1 and x\u2082 >x\u2081.\n\nBut then for n=2, x\u2083 =x\u2082(x\u2082 +1/2). We need x\u2083 >x\u2082 and x\u2083 <1. So x\u2082 must satisfy x\u2082\u00b2 +x\u2082/2 >x\u2082 \u2192 x\u2082\u00b2 -x\u2082/2 >0 \u2192x\u2082(x\u2082 -1/2) >0. Since x\u2082 >0, this implies x\u2082 >1/2. Also, x\u2082\u00b2 +x\u2082/2 <1. Let's solve x\u2082\u00b2 +x\u2082/2 -1 <0. The roots are [-1/4 \u00b1\u221a(1/16 +4)]/2 = [-1/4 \u00b1\u221a(65/16)]/2 = [-1/4 \u00b1\u221a65/4]/2 = [ -1 \u00b1\u221a65 ]/8. The positive root is (\u221a65 -1)/8 \u2248 (8.06 -1)/8 \u22487.06/8\u22480.8825. So x\u2082 must be in (1/2, (\u221a65 -1)/8 \u22480.8825) to satisfy x\u2083 \u2208(x\u2082,1).\n\nBut x\u2082 itself is determined by x\u2081: x\u2082 =x\u2081\u00b2 +x\u2081. So x\u2081 must be chosen such that x\u2082 =x\u2081\u00b2 +x\u2081 is in (1/2, (\u221a65 -1)/8). Let's find the corresponding x\u2081 values. The lower bound: x\u2081\u00b2 +x\u2081 >1/2 \u2192x\u2081\u00b2 +x\u2081 -1/2 >0. Roots are [-1 \u00b1\u221a(1 +2)]/2 = [-1 \u00b1\u221a3]/2. The positive root is (-1 +\u221a3)/2 \u22480.366. So x\u2081 must be >0.366 to have x\u2082 >1/2. But x\u2081 must also be < (\u221a5 -1)/2 \u22480.618 to have x\u2082 <0.618\u00b2 +0.618 \u22480.618*(0.618 +1) \u22480.618*1.618\u22481, but wait, no: x\u2082 =x\u2081(x\u2081 +1). If x\u2081 is 0.618, then x\u2082 =0.618*(1.618)\u22481, which is the upper bound. So x\u2081 must be in (0.366, 0.618) to have x\u2082 in (0.5, ~0.8825). But this is getting complicated. Each subsequent term imposes a new constraint on x\u2081, narrowing down the possible values.\n\nThis suggests that the initial value x\u2081 must satisfy an infinite sequence of inequalities, each corresponding to a term in the sequence. The intersection of all these intervals might be a single point, which would be the unique x\u2081. To prove existence and uniqueness, we might need to show that these intervals are nested and their intersection is a singleton.\n\nAlternatively, consider defining a function f_n(x) such that x_{n} is determined by x\u2081 through these recursive relations. Then, the conditions 0 <x_n <x_{n+1} <1 for all n translate into x\u2081 belonging to the intersection of all the domains where each f_n(x) satisfies these inequalities. If each subsequent condition narrows the interval for x\u2081, and the intervals converge to a single point, then that's the unique x\u2081.\n\nAnother approach is to model this as a telescoping product. Let's try to express x_n in terms of x\u2081. For example:\n\nx\u2082 =x\u2081(x\u2081 +1)\n\nx\u2083 =x\u2082(x\u2082 +1/2) =x\u2081(x\u2081 +1)(x\u2081(x\u2081 +1) +1/2)\n\nx\u2084 =x\u2083(x\u2083 +1/3) = [x\u2081(x\u2081 +1)(x\u2081(x\u2081 +1) +1/2)] * [x\u2081(x\u2081 +1)(x\u2081(x\u2081 +1) +1/2) +1/3]\n\nThis quickly becomes unwieldy, but perhaps there's a pattern or a way to bound these terms. However, it's not obvious how to proceed this way.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the sequence must approach 1. Suppose we define y_n =1 -x_n. Then y_n decreases to 0. Substitute into the recursion:\n\nx_{n+1} =x_n\u00b2 +x_n/n \u21921 -y_{n+1} = (1 -y_n)^2 + (1 -y_n)/n\n\nExpanding:\n\n1 -y_{n+1} =1 -2y_n +y_n\u00b2 + (1/n -y_n/n)\n\nSimplify:\n\n1 -y_{n+1} =1 -2y_n +y_n\u00b2 +1/n -y_n/n\n\nSubtract 1 from both sides:\n\n-y_{n+1} = -2y_n +y_n\u00b2 +1/n -y_n/n\n\nMultiply by -1:\n\ny_{n+1} =2y_n -y_n\u00b2 -1/n +y_n/n\n\nCombine terms:\n\ny_{n+1} = y_n(2 +1/n) -y_n\u00b2 -1/n\n\nThis might not be helpful directly, but perhaps for small y_n (since approaching 1), the quadratic term y_n\u00b2 is negligible, leading to y_{n+1} \u2248 (2 +1/n)y_n -1/n. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem requires the sequence to be increasing and bounded above by 1, by the Monotone Convergence Theorem, it must converge to 1. So the limit is 1. Then, using the recursion, taking n\u2192\u221e, we have L= L\u00b2 +0 \u2192 L=0 or 1. Since the sequence is increasing and bounded by 1, L=1.\n\nNow, to ensure that the sequence converges to 1 and stays strictly increasing, the initial term x\u2081 must be chosen such that each subsequent term approaches 1 in a controlled way. The uniqueness might come from the fact that any deviation from the precise x\u2081 would either cause the sequence to exceed 1 at some point or fail to be increasing.\n\nAnother angle: consider the function f_n(x) =x(x +1/n). For x in (0,1), f_n(x) is increasing because the derivative f_n\u2019(x) =2x +1/n >0. So each step is monotonically increasing in x_n. Therefore, the entire sequence is determined by x\u2081, and each x_{n+1} is a strictly increasing function of x_n. Thus, the conditions 0 <x_n <x_{n+1} <1 for all n impose that x\u2081 must be in the intersection of all the pre-images of (0,1) under these functions. Since each f_n(x) maps (0, a_n) to (0,1), where a_n is the solution to x(x +1/n)=1, the allowable x_n must be less than a_n. But since each a_n is less than 1 (since for x=1, f_n(1)=1(1+1/n) >1), the constraints become tighter as n increases. The intersection of all these intervals might be a single point.\n\nTo formalize this, suppose we define for each n, the maximum allowable x_n is a_n where a_n(a_n +1/n)=1. Solving for a_n: a_n\u00b2 +a_n/n -1=0. The positive solution is a_n = [ -1/(2n) + sqrt(1/(4n\u00b2) +4) ] /2. As n increases, 1/n decreases, so a_n approaches 1. For example, a\u2081 = (\u221a5 -1)/2 \u22480.618, a\u2082 would be larger, approaching 1 as n\u2192\u221e. But since the sequence is increasing, x_{n} must be less than a_n, but also x_{n+1} =x_n(x_n +1/n) <a_{n+1}. This creates a recursive condition on x\u2081. The only x\u2081 that satisfies all these conditions for all n is the limit of the sequence defined by a_n, but since a_n approaches 1, this might not directly help.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the sequence {x_n} must satisfy x_{n} <a_n for all n",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. We need to find the greatest distance between a point in set A and a point in set B. Both sets are solutions to cubic equations in the complex plane. \n\nFirst, let's understand what sets A and B are. \n\nSet A is the solutions to z\u00b3 - 8 = 0. That equation factors as (z - 2)(z\u00b2 + 2z + 4) = 0. So the solutions are z = 2 and the roots of z\u00b2 + 2z + 4 = 0. Using the quadratic formula, those roots are (-2 \u00b1 \u221a(4 - 16))/2 = (-2 \u00b1 \u221a(-12))/2 = -1 \u00b1 i\u221a3. So set A has three points: 2, -1 + i\u221a3, and -1 - i\u221a3. These are the cube roots of 8, forming an equilateral triangle in the complex plane with vertices at these points.\n\nNow, set B is the solutions to z\u00b3 - 8z\u00b2 -8z +64 =0. Let's try to factor this equation. Maybe factor by grouping? Let's see:\n\nz\u00b3 -8z\u00b2 -8z +64. Group as (z\u00b3 -8z\u00b2) + (-8z +64). Factor out z\u00b2 from the first group: z\u00b2(z -8) -8(z -8). So (z\u00b2 -8)(z -8) =0. Wait, but that would give z=8 and z\u00b2=8, so z=\u00b1\u221a8=\u00b12\u221a2. Wait, but let me check the factoring again. Wait, original equation: z\u00b3 -8z\u00b2 -8z +64. Let me verify if (z -8)(z\u00b2 -8) is correct. Multiply out (z -8)(z\u00b2 -8) = z\u00b3 -8z\u00b2 -8z +64. Yes, that's correct. So the roots are z=8 and z=\u00b1\u221a8=\u00b12\u221a2. So set B has three points: 8, 2\u221a2, and -2\u221a2. Wait, but \u221a8 is 2\u221a2, right? So yes, those are the points.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me confirm the factoring again. Let's expand (z -8)(z\u00b2 -8):\n\nz*(z\u00b2 -8) -8*(z\u00b2 -8) = z\u00b3 -8z -8z\u00b2 +64 = z\u00b3 -8z\u00b2 -8z +64. Yes, that's exactly the original equation. So the roots are z=8, z=\u221a8, z=-\u221a8. But \u221a8 is 2\u221a2, so the roots are 8, 2\u221a2, -2\u221a2. So set B has three points: 8, 2\u221a2, and -2\u221a2.\n\nNow, we need to find the maximum distance between any point in A and any point in B. The points in A are 2, -1 + i\u221a3, -1 - i\u221a3. The points in B are 8, 2\u221a2, -2\u221a2. Wait, but 2\u221a2 is approximately 2.828, and -2\u221a2 is approximately -2.828. So the points in B are real numbers except for 8, which is a real number as well. Wait, no, all points in B are real? Because z=8, z=2\u221a2, z=-2\u221a2. So all points in B lie on the real axis. But points in A: 2 is real, but the other two are complex numbers at (-1, \u221a3) and (-1, -\u221a3). So they are located in the complex plane at positions (-1, \u00b1\u221a3). \n\nSo to find the maximum distance between a point in A and a point in B, we need to compute the distances between each pair of points from A and B and find the maximum.\n\nLet's list all possible pairs:\n\nFrom A: 2, (-1, \u221a3), (-1, -\u221a3)\n\nFrom B: 8, 2\u221a2, -2\u221a2\n\nSo compute distances between each of the three points in A and each of the three points in B.\n\nFirst, let's compute the distance between 2 (from A) and 8 (from B). Since both are on the real line, the distance is |8 - 2| = 6.\n\nNext, distance between 2 and 2\u221a2. Since 2\u221a2 \u2248 2.828, the distance is |2\u221a2 - 2|. Let's compute this: 2\u221a2 \u2248 2.828, so 2.828 - 2 = 0.828, so distance \u22480.828. But maybe exact value is 2\u221a2 -2, but since distance is absolute, it's |2\u221a2 -2|. But since 2\u221a2 >2, it's 2\u221a2 -2 \u22480.828.\n\nThen, distance between 2 and -2\u221a2: | -2\u221a2 -2 | = | - (2\u221a2 +2) | = 2\u221a2 +2 \u22484.828.\n\nNow, next point in A: (-1, \u221a3). Let's compute distance to each point in B.\n\nFirst, distance to 8 (real line). The point (-1, \u221a3) is in the complex plane at x=-1, y=\u221a3. The point 8 is at (8,0). The distance is sqrt[(8 - (-1))\u00b2 + (0 - \u221a3)\u00b2] = sqrt[(9)\u00b2 + (\u221a3)\u00b2] = sqrt[81 +3] = sqrt[84] = 2*sqrt(21). Because 84=4*21, so sqrt(4*21)=2\u221a21 \u22489.165.\n\nNext, distance from (-1, \u221a3) to 2\u221a2 (which is at (2\u221a2,0)). Compute sqrt[(2\u221a2 - (-1))\u00b2 + (0 - \u221a3)\u00b2] = sqrt[(2\u221a2 +1)\u00b2 + (\u221a3)\u00b2]. Let's compute (2\u221a2 +1)^2 = (2\u221a2)^2 + 2*2\u221a2*1 +1^2 = 8 +4\u221a2 +1 =9 +4\u221a2. Then add (\u221a3)^2=3. So total inside sqrt is 9 +4\u221a2 +3=12 +4\u221a2. So sqrt(12 +4\u221a2). Let's approximate: \u221a2\u22481.414, so 4\u221a2\u22485.656. So 12+5.656\u224817.656. sqrt(17.656)\u22484.202. So this distance is approximately 4.202.\n\nThen, distance from (-1, \u221a3) to -2\u221a2 (which is at (-2\u221a2,0)). Compute sqrt[(-2\u221a2 - (-1))\u00b2 + (0 - \u221a3)^2] = sqrt[(-2\u221a2 +1)^2 +3]. Compute (-2\u221a2 +1)^2 = (1 -2\u221a2)^2 =1 -4\u221a2 + (2\u221a2)^2 =1 -4\u221a2 +8=9 -4\u221a2. Then add 3: 9 -4\u221a2 +3=12 -4\u221a2. So sqrt(12 -4\u221a2). Approximate: 4\u221a2\u22485.656, so 12-5.656\u22486.344. sqrt(6.344)\u22482.519. So this distance is about 2.519.\n\nNow, the third point in A: (-1, -\u221a3). The distances to points in B will be the same as for (-1, \u221a3) because the y-coordinate is squared in the distance formula. So distance to 8 is still sqrt[9\u00b2 + (\u221a3)^2] = sqrt(84)=2\u221a21. Distance to 2\u221a2 is same as above, and distance to -2\u221a2 same as above. So same maximum here.\n\nNow, the last point in A is (-1, \u00b1\u221a3). So their maximum distance to B is 2\u221a21. Then, the other points in A: 2. The maximum distance from 2 to B is 6 (distance to 8) and 2\u221a2 +2\u22484.828. So 6 is larger than 4.828. So comparing the maximum distances: 6 vs 2\u221a21. Which is larger?\n\nCompute 2\u221a21: \u221a21\u22484.583, so 2*4.583\u22489.166. So 2\u221a21\u22489.166, which is larger than 6. Therefore, the maximum distance is 2\u221a21, which is option D.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. The problem says \"greatest distance between a point of A and a point of B\". So the maximum is between (-1, \u00b1\u221a3) and 8, which gives 2\u221a21. The other distances from 2 to 8 is 6, which is less than 2\u221a21. So the answer is D, 2\u221a21.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo find the greatest distance between a point in set \\( A \\) (solutions to \\( z^3 - 8 = 0 \\)) and a point in set \\( B \\) (solutions to \\( z^3 - 8z^2 - 8z + 64 = 0 \\)), we first identify the roots of both equations.\n\n**Set \\( A \\):**  \nThe equation \\( z^3 - 8 = 0 \\) factors as \\( (z - 2)(z^2 + 2z + 4) = 0 \\).

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, we have two real numbers, x and y. Their arithmetic mean is 7, and their geometric mean is the square root of 19. We need to find x squared plus y squared and show that it's 158.\n\nFirst, let's recall what arithmetic mean (AM) and geometric mean (GM) mean. The arithmetic mean of x and y is (x + y)/2, and the geometric mean is sqrt(xy). The problem states that the AM is 7, so (x + y)/2 = 7. That means x + y = 14. Then the GM is sqrt(19), so sqrt(xy) = sqrt(19), which implies that xy = 19.\n\nNow, the question is asking for x\u00b2 + y\u00b2. I remember that there's a formula that relates x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 to (x + y)\u00b2 and xy. Let me think. Yes, (x + y)\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + 2xy + y\u00b2. So if we subtract 2xy from both sides, we get x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = (x + y)\u00b2 - 2xy.\n\nWe already know x + y is 14, so (14)\u00b2 is 196. And we know xy is 19, so 2xy is 38. Therefore, x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 should be 196 - 38, which is 158. That seems straightforward. But let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nWait, let's verify each step. The arithmetic mean is 7, so multiplying both sides by 2 gives x + y = 14. Correct. The geometric mean is sqrt(19), so squaring both sides gives xy = 19. That's right. Then using the identity (x + y)\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + 2xy + y\u00b2, solving for x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 gives (x + y)\u00b2 - 2xy. Plugging in the numbers: 14 squared is 196, 2 times 19 is 38. 196 minus 38 is indeed 158. Yep, that checks out.\n\nI don't see any errors here. The key was remembering the algebraic identity that connects the sum of squares to the square of the sum and the product. Since we had both the sum and the product from the given means, substituting them directly gives the answer. This seems solid. I think that's all there is to it.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nWe start with the given information: two real numbers \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) have an arithmetic mean of 7 and a geometric mean of \\( \\sqrt{19} \\). Our goal is to find \\( x^2 + y^2 \\).\n\n1. **Arithmetic Mean**:  \n   The arithmetic mean of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) is \\( \\frac{x + y}{2} = 7 \\). Multiplying both sides by 2 gives:  \n   \\[\n   x + y = 14.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Geometric Mean**:  \n   The geometric mean of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) is \\( \\sqrt{xy} = \\sqrt{19} \\). Squaring both sides gives:  \n   \\[\n   xy = 19.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Relating \\( x^2 + y^2 \\) to \\( x + y \\) and \\( xy \\)**:  \n   Recall the algebraic identity:  \n   \\[\n   (x + y)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2.\n   \\]  \n   Rearranging this to solve for \\( x^2 + y^2 \\), we get:  \n   \\[\n   x^2 + y^2 = (x + y)^2 - 2xy.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Substitute Known Values**:  \n   Plugging in \\( x + y = 14 \\) and \\( xy = 19 \\):  \n   \\[\n   x^2 + y^2 = (14)^2 - 2(19) = 196 - 38 = 158.\n   \\]\n\nThus, \\( x^2 + y^2 = 158 \\). The key steps involve using the definitions of arithmetic and geometric means to derive \\( x + y \\) and \\( xy \\), then applying the algebraic identity to connect these values to \\( x^2 + y^2 \\).

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, we need to show that if r is a real number where the cube root of r plus the reciprocal of the cube root of r equals 3, then r cubed plus the reciprocal of r cubed equals 5778. Hmm, that seems a bit complex, but maybe there's a pattern or algebraic identity we can use here.\n\nFirst, let me restate the given equation to make it easier. Let's let x be the cube root of r. So, x = r^(1/3). Then, the given condition becomes x + 1/x = 3. That looks familiar\u2014it's a common type of equation where the sum of a variable and its reciprocal is given. I remember that squaring such expressions often helps find higher powers.\n\nOur goal is to find r^3 + 1/r^3. Since x is the cube root of r, then x^3 = r. Therefore, 1/r = 1/x^3. So, r^3 + 1/r^3 would be (x^3)^3 + (1/x^3)^3, which simplifies to x^9 + 1/x^9. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, no. Wait, if x = r^(1/3), then r = x^3. So, r^3 is (x^3)^3 = x^9, and 1/r^3 is 1/(x^3)^3 = x^(-9). So, r^3 + 1/r^3 = x^9 + x^(-9). Hmm, but maybe there's a better way to approach this without going all the way to the ninth power. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can express r^3 + 1/r^3 in terms of x + 1/x. Since x + 1/x = 3, perhaps we can find x^3 + 1/x^3 first, then build up to higher powers. Let's try that.\n\nStarting with x + 1/x = 3. Let's compute x^3 + 1/x^3. There's a formula for that: (x + 1/x)^3 = x^3 + 1/x^3 + 3(x + 1/x). Let me verify that. Expanding (x + 1/x)^3:\n\n(x + 1/x)^3 = x^3 + 3x^2*(1/x) + 3x*(1/x)^2 + (1/x)^3\n= x^3 + 3x + 3/x + 1/x^3\n= x^3 + 1/x^3 + 3(x + 1/x)\n\nYes, that's correct. So, (x + 1/x)^3 = x^3 + 1/x^3 + 3(x + 1/x). Since we know x + 1/x = 3, then:\n\n3^3 = x^3 + 1/x^3 + 3*3\n27 = x^3 + 1/x^3 + 9\nSubtracting 9 from both sides: x^3 + 1/x^3 = 27 - 9 = 18.\n\nOkay, so x^3 + 1/x^3 = 18. But we need r^3 + 1/r^3. Wait, since r = x^3, then 1/r = 1/x^3. Therefore, r^3 = (x^3)^3 = x^9, and 1/r^3 = 1/x^9. So, r^3 + 1/r^3 = x^9 + 1/x^9. So, we need to find x^9 + 1/x^9 given that x + 1/x = 3.\n\nHmm, so maybe we can find a pattern where each time we can compute higher powers by using the previous results. Let's see. We already have x + 1/x = 3 and x^3 + 1/x^3 = 18. Let's try to find x^9 + 1/x^9 step by step.\n\nFirst, let's compute x^3 + 1/x^3 = 18. Let's denote S_n = x^n + 1/x^n. Then S_1 = 3, S_3 = 18. Maybe we can find S_9 by finding intermediate terms like S_3, S_6, S_9.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a recurrence relation. Let's recall that S_n * S_m = (x^n + 1/x^n)(x^m + 1/x^m) = x^{n+m} + x^{n-m} + x^{m-n} + x^{-n-m} = S_{n+m} + S_{n-m} if n > m. But maybe that's complicating things.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the fact that S_{n+1} = (x + 1/x) * S_n - S_{n-1}. Wait, that's a recurrence relation for these kinds of expressions. Let me check that.\n\nFor example, S_2 = (x + 1/x)^2 - 2 = 3^2 - 2 = 9 - 2 = 7. Then S_3 = (x + 1/x)*S_2 - S_1 = 3*7 - 3 = 21 - 3 = 18, which matches our earlier result. So yes, the recurrence relation is S_n = (x + 1/x) * S_{n-1} - S_{n-2}.\n\nGiven that, let's compute S_1 = 3, S_2 = 7 (as above), S_3 = 18. Then S_4 = 3*S_3 - S_2 = 3*18 -7 = 54 -7 =47. S_5 =3*S_4 - S_3 =3*47 -18=141 -18=123. S_6=3*S_5 -S_4=3*123 -47=369 -47=322. S_7=3*S_6 -S_5=3*322 -123=966 -123=843. S_8=3*S_7 -S_6=3*843 -322=2529 -322=2207. S_9=3*S_8 -S_7=3*2207 -843=6621 -843=5778. There we go! So S_9 =5778. But S_9 is x^9 +1/x^9, which is exactly r^3 +1/r^3. Therefore, r^3 +1/r^3=5778. That's the result we needed to prove.\n\nWait, let me verify the steps again to make sure I didn't make a calculation error. Let's go step by step:\n\nGiven S_1 =3, S_2= (3)^2 -2=9-2=7.\n\nS_3=3*S_2 - S_1=3*7 -3=21-3=18. Correct.\n\nS_4=3*S_3 - S_2=3*18 -7=54-7=47. Correct.\n\nS_5=3*47 -18=141-18=123. Correct.\n\nS_6=3*123 -47=369-47=322. Correct.\n\nS_7=3*322 -123=966-123=843. Correct.\n\nS_8=3*843 -322=2529-322=2207. Correct.\n\nS_9=3*2207 -843=6621-843=5778. Yes, that's right.\n\nSo each step uses the recurrence relation S_n =3*S_{n-1} -S_{n-2}. Therefore, by building up step by step, we arrive at S_9=5778. Hence, r^3 +1/r^3=5778. That's exactly what we needed to show. Therefore, the proof is complete.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nLet's start by letting \\( x = r^{1/3} \\). The given condition \\( r^{1/3} + \\frac{1}{r^{1/3}} = 3 \\) simplifies to \\( x + \\frac{1}{x} = 3 \\). Our goal is to show that \\( r^3 + \\frac{1}{r^3} = 5778 \\). Since \\( r = x^3 \\), this translates to finding \\( x^9 + \\frac{1}{x^9} \\).\n\nFirst, compute \\( x^3 + \\frac{1}{x^3} \\). Using the identity:\n\\[\n\\left(x + \\frac{1}{x}\\right)^3 = x^3 + \\frac{1}{x^3} + 3\\left(x + \\frac{1}{x}\\right),\n\\]\nsubstitute \\( x + \\frac{1}{x} = 3 \\):\n\\[\n3^3 = x^3 + \\frac{1}{x^3} + 3 \\cdot 3 \\implies 27 = x^3 + \\frac{1}{x^3} + 9 \\implies x^3 + \\frac{1}{x^3} = 18.\n\\]\n\nNext, use a recurrence relation for powers of \\( x + \\frac{1}{x} \\). Define \\( S_n = x^n + \\frac{1}{x^n} \\). The relation \\( S_n = 3S_{n-1} - S_{n-2} \\) holds (derived from polynomial expansions). Starting with:\n\\[\nS_1 = 3, \\quad S_2 = \\left(x + \\frac{1}{x}\\right)^2 - 2 = 9 - 2 = 7,\n\\]\nwe iteratively compute:\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nS_3 &= 3 \\cdot 7 - 3 = 18, \\\\\nS_4 &= 3 \\cdot 18 - 7 = 47, \\\\\nS_5 &= 3 \\cdot 47 - 18 = 123, \\\\\nS_6 &= 3 \\cdot 123 - 47 = 322, \\\\\nS_7 &= 3 \\cdot 322 - 123 = 843, \\\\\nS_8 &= 3 \\cdot 843 - 322 = 2207, \\\\\nS_9 &= 3 \\cdot 2207 - 843 = 5778.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nThus, \\( x^9 + \\frac{1}{x^9} = 5778 \\), which equals \\( r^3 + \\frac{1}{r^3} \\).

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to calculate the product of three square roots: sqrt(60x) times sqrt(12x) times sqrt(63x), and then simplify it to the form 36x sqrt(35x). Hmm, how do I approach this?\n\nFirst, I remember that when you multiply square roots together, you can combine them under a single square root by multiplying the expressions inside. So, sqrt(a) * sqrt(b) = sqrt(ab). But here there are three terms, so maybe I can combine all three at once. Let me check that rule again. Yeah, the product of multiple square roots is the square root of the product of all the radicands. So, sqrt(60x) * sqrt(12x) * sqrt(63x) should equal sqrt((60x)(12x)(63x)). That seems right.\n\nNow, let's compute the product inside the square root. Let's break down each number into their prime factors to see if we can simplify. Let's start with 60, 12, and 63.\n\n60 factors into 2^2 * 3 * 5. Because 60 = 2*2*3*5.\n12 factors into 2^2 * 3. Since 12 = 2*2*3.\n63 factors into 3^2 * 7. Because 63 = 7*9 = 7*3^2.\n\nSo multiplying all the numerical parts: (2^2 *3*5) * (2^2 *3) * (3^2 *7). Let's add up the exponents for each prime.\n\nFor 2: 2 + 2 = 4 (from 60 and 12) and there's no other 2s in 63. So total exponent for 2 is 4.\n\nFor 3: 1 (from 60) +1 (from 12) +2 (from 63) = 4. So 3^4.\n\nFor 5: only in 60, exponent 1.\n\nFor 7: only in 63, exponent 1.\n\nSo multiplying all together: 2^4 * 3^4 *5 *7.\n\nNow, the x terms: each sqrt term has an x inside. So (x) * (x) * (x) = x^3. So inside the square root, we have x^3.\n\nPutting it all together, the product inside the square root is 2^4 *3^4 *5*7*x^3.\n\nSo the entire expression is sqrt(2^4 *3^4 *5*7*x^3).\n\nNow, to simplify the square root. Remember that sqrt(a^2) = a. So for even exponents, we can take them out of the square root. Let's look at each factor:\n\n- 2^4 is (2^2)^2, so sqrt(2^4) = 2^2 =4.\n- 3^4 is (3^2)^2, so sqrt(3^4)=3^2=9.\n- 5 and 7 are to the first power, so they stay inside.\n- x^3 can be written as x^2 *x, so sqrt(x^3) = sqrt(x^2 *x) = x*sqrt(x).\n\nPutting this all together:\n\nsqrt(2^4 *3^4 *5*7*x^3) = sqrt(2^4) * sqrt(3^4) * sqrt(5*7) * sqrt(x^3) = 4 *9 * sqrt(35) *x*sqrt(x).\n\nMultiplying the constants: 4*9 =36. Then, x*sqrt(x) is x times x^(1/2), which is x^(3/2), but maybe better to write as x*sqrt(x). However, when combining with the sqrt(35), it becomes sqrt(35x) multiplied by x. Wait, let me check that.\n\nWait, sqrt(x^3) is x*sqrt(x), right? Because x^3 =x^2 *x, so sqrt(x^3)=sqrt(x^2 *x)=sqrt(x^2)*sqrt(x)=x*sqrt(x). So that term is x*sqrt(x). Then, the sqrt(35) comes from sqrt(5*7)=sqrt(35). So combining all together:\n\n36 * x * sqrt(x) * sqrt(35) =36x * sqrt(35x). Because sqrt(x)*sqrt(35) is sqrt(35x). So yes, combining those under a single square root gives sqrt(35x). Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 36x sqrt(35x).\n\nLet me verify each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Combining the square roots first, then factoring each number. The exponents for primes: 2^4, 3^4, 5,7. Then x^3. Then taking out squares: 2^2, 3^2, x^1 (from x^2 inside), leaving 5,7, and x inside. Multiplying the constants 4*9=36, x from the x^2, and then sqrt(35x). So yes, 36x sqrt(35x). That matches the expected answer. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo simplify the expression \\(\\sqrt{60x} \\cdot \\sqrt{12x} \\cdot \\sqrt{63x}\\), we start by combining the square roots into a single radical. Using the property \\(\\sqrt{a} \\cdot \\sqrt{b} = \\sqrt{ab}\\), we rewrite the product as:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(60x)(12x)(63x)}.\n\\]\n\nNext, multiply the numerical coefficients and the variables separately. For the numbers:\n\\[\n60 \\times 12 \\times 63 = (2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5) \\times (2^2 \\cdot 3) \\times (3^2 \\cdot 7) = 2^4 \\cdot 3^4 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7.\n\\]\nFor the variables:\n\\[\nx \\cdot x \\cdot x = x^3.\n\\]\nSo the combined expression under the square root becomes:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{2^4 \\cdot 3^4 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot x^3}.\n\\]\n\nNow simplify the square root by extracting perfect squares:\n- \\(2^4 = (2^2)^2\\), so \\(\\sqrt{2^4} = 2^2 = 4\\).\n- \\(3^4 = (3^2)^2\\), so \\(\\sqrt{3^4} = 3^2 = 9\\).\n- \\(x^3 = x^2 \\cdot x\\), so \\(\\sqrt{x^3} = x\\sqrt{x}\\).\n- The remaining terms \\(5\\), \\(7\\), and \\(x\\) stay inside the radical as \\(\\sqrt{5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot x} = \\sqrt{35x}\\).\n\nMultiplying the extracted terms:\n\\[\n4 \\cdot 9 \\cdot x \\cdot \\sqrt{35x} = 36x \\cdot \\sqrt{35x}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the simplified form of the original expression is:\n\\[\n36x\\sqrt{35x}.\n\\]\nPrevious attempt failed with: maximum recursion depth has been reached\nuse `set_option maxRecDepth <num>` to increase limit\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  \u221a(?m.5172 * ?y)\nx : NNReal\n\u22a2 \u221a60 * \u221a\u2191x ^ 3 * \u221a12 * \u221a63 = \u2191x * (\u221a\u2191x * \u221a35) * 36\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  \u221a(?m.6008 * ?y)\nx : NNReal\n\u22a2 \u221a60 * \u221a\u2191x ^ 3 * \u221a12 * \u221a63 = \u2191x * (\u221a\u2191x * \u221a35) * 36\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  \u221a(?m.6844 * ?y)\nx : NNReal\n\u22a2 \u221a60 * \u221a\u2191x ^ 3 * \u221a12 * \u221a63 = \u2191x * (\u221a\u2191x * \u221a35) * 36\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  \u221a(?m.7680 * ?y)\nx : NNReal\n\u22a2 \u221a60 * \u221a\u2191x ^ 3 * \u221a12 * \u221a63 = \u2191x * (\u221a\u2191x * \u221a35) * 36\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  \u221a(?m.8516 * ?y)\nx : NNReal\n\u22a2 \u221a60 * \u221a\u2191x ^ 3 * \u221a12 * \u221a63 = \u2191x * (\u221a\u2191x * \u221a35) * 36\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  \u221a(?m.9352 * ?y)\nx : NNReal\n\u22a2 \u221a60 * \u221a\u2191x ^ 3 * \u221a12 * \u221a63 = \u2191x * (\u221a\u2191x * \u221a35) * 36\nunsolved goals\nx : NNReal\n\u22a2 \u221a60 * \u221a\u2191x ^ 3 * \u221a12 * \u221a63 = \u2191x * (\u221a\u2191x * \u221a35) * 36\n\ncase hx\nx : NNReal\n\u22a2 0 \u2264 63\n\ncase hx\nx : NNReal\n\u22a2 0 \u2264 12\n\ncase hx\nx : NNReal\n\u22a2 0 \u2264 60\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  \u221a?m.874 * \u221a?y\nx : NNReal\n\u22a2 \u221a(60 * \u2191x * (12 * \u2191x) * (63 * \u2191x)) = 36 * \u2191x * \u221a(35 * \u2191x)\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, Jasmine drank 1.5 pints of water on the first 3 miles of her hike. We need to find out how many pints she'd drink in the next 10 miles if she continues at the same rate. The answer should be 5 pints. Let me think how to show that.\n\nFirst, the problem is about rate. She has a consumption rate of water per mile. The initial data is 1.5 pints over 3 miles. So maybe I should find out how much she drinks per mile and then multiply by 10 miles.\n\nWait, let's check. If she drinks 1.5 pints in 3 miles, then per mile that's 1.5 divided by 3. Let me compute that: 1.5 \u00f7 3 = 0.5 pints per mile. So, 0.5 pints per mile. Then, for 10 miles, that would be 0.5 \u00d7 10 = 5 pints. That seems straightforward. But maybe I need to present this more formally as a proof.\n\nBut wait, the context given in the problem refers to a solution involving the perimeter of a circle and some variables. The previous problem was about a runner's refreshment, where the solution involved calculating distance run as n times 2\u03c0t, and then multiplying by s to get the total beer. Then they rearranged variables to get 2\u03c0nts. But how does that relate here?\n\nHmm, maybe the context is just an example of a rate problem, where you calculate total consumption by multiplying rate by distance. In the runner's problem, the rate was s quarts per unit distance, so total beer is rate \u00d7 distance. Similarly here, we need to find the rate (pints per mile) and then multiply by the new distance (10 miles) to get total pints.\n\nSo, applying the same structure: first, determine the rate. The initial consumption is 1.5 pints over 3 miles. So rate r = total consumption / distance = 1.5 pints / 3 miles = 0.5 pints per mile. Then, for 10 miles, total water = rate \u00d7 distance = 0.5 pints/mile \u00d7 10 miles = 5 pints. Therefore, the answer is 5 pints.\n\nBut maybe I need to explain why the rate is constant and how we know it's proportional. The problem states she continues at \"this rate,\" so we can assume the rate is constant. Therefore, the relationship between distance and water consumed is linear. So, if 3 miles correspond to 1.5 pints, then 1 mile corresponds to 0.5 pints, and 10 miles would be 10 times that, hence 5 pints.\n\nAlternatively, setting up a proportion. If 3 miles : 1.5 pints, then 10 miles : x pints. So, 3/1.5 = 10/x. Wait, no, the proportion should be set up as miles1/pints1 = miles2/pints2 if the rate is the same. Wait, actually, since the rate is pints per mile, the ratio should be pints1/miles1 = pints2/miles2. So 1.5/3 = x/10. Solving for x: (1.5/3) = 0.5 = x/10 \u2192 x = 0.5 \u00d710 =5. That's another way to present it.\n\nEither way, the key is recognizing the rate and applying it to the new distance. The context's solution used rate multiplied by distance, so this aligns with that approach. The previous problem's solution involved multiplying the number of laps (n) by the circumference (2\u03c0t) to get distance, then multiplying by the rate (s) to get total beer. Similarly here, we compute the rate from the given data and apply it to the new distance.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the proof would explain the rate calculation, verify the units, and then apply the rate to the 10 miles. The answer is 5 pints, which matches the problem's assertion. I need to make sure each step is clear and that the reasoning follows logically, using the rate concept as in the context example.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nJasmine's water consumption rate is determined by the initial part of her hike. She drank 1.5 pints over 3 miles. To find her rate of consumption, we divide the total pints by the distance:  \n\\[\n\\text{Rate} = \\frac{1.5 \\, \\text{pints}}{3 \\, \\text{miles}} = 0.5 \\, \\text{pints per mile}.\n\\]  \nThis means she drinks 0.5 pints for every mile she hikes.  \n\nFor the next 10 miles, we multiply her rate by the new distance:  \n\\[\n\\text{Total water} = 0.5 \\, \\text{pints/mile} \\times 10 \\, \\text{miles} = 5 \\, \\text{pints}.\n\\]  \nThe calculation confirms that Jasmine would drink **5 pints** of water over the additional 10 miles, assuming her rate remains constant. This aligns with the proportional relationship between distance and water consumption, similar to rate-based problems like the \"Runner's Refreshment\" example, where total consumption depends on multiplying rate by distance.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about Sally, Wei-Hwa, and Zoe combining their marbles and figuring out how many need to be removed so they can start the game. The game requires making as many piles of 10 marbles as possible. So, the key here is to find out the total number of marbles and then determine how many are left over when you divide that total by 10. The number of marbles to remove would be the remainder when the total is divided by 10, right? Because if you take away the remainder, the remaining number would be exactly divisible by 10.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total marbles. Sally has 239, Wei-Hwa has 174, and Zoe has 83. Adding those together: 239 + 174. Let me do that step by step. 200 + 100 is 300, 30 + 70 is 100, 9 + 4 is 13. So 300 + 100 is 400, plus 13 is 413. Then adding Zoe's 83: 413 + 83. 400 + 80 is 480, and 13 + 3 is 16, so 480 +16=496. Wait, wait, that can't be right. Wait, 239 + 174. Let me check again. 239 + 174: 200+100=300, 30+70=100, 9+4=13. So 300+100=400, +13=413. Then 413 +83: 400+80=480, 13+3=16, so 480+16=496. Yeah, total marbles are 496.\n\nNow, we need to divide 496 by 10 to see how many full piles of 10 they can make. 496 divided by 10 is 49 with a remainder. 49*10=490, so 496-490=6. So the remainder is 6. That means if they remove 6 marbles, the remaining 490 will be divisible by 10, allowing them to make 49 piles. Therefore, they need to remove 6 marbles.\n\nWait, but let me make sure there's no other way. The problem says \"how many must be removed in order to start the game\". The game requires arranging as many piles of 10 as possible. So the maximum number of piles is the total divided by 10, discarding the remainder. Therefore, the number to remove is indeed the remainder. So 496 divided by 10 gives 49.6, which means 49 piles and 6 left over. Remove those 6, and you have 490, which is 49*10. So yes, the answer is 6.\n\nI think that's it. The key steps are adding all marbles, finding the remainder when divided by 10, and that remainder is the number to remove. The context given earlier had a problem where they used equations to solve for n by setting up relationships between the amounts. Here, it's more straightforward with division and remainders. The main mathematical concept here is division with remainder, and understanding that the remainder is the number that needs to be removed to make the total a multiple of 10.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo determine how many marbles must be removed to start the game, we first calculate the total number of marbles Sally, Wei-Hwa, and Zoe have combined. Sally has 239 marbles, Wei-Hwa has 174 marbles, and Zoe has 83 marbles. Adding these together:\n\n\\[\n239 + 174 + 83 = 496 \\text{ marbles}.\n\\]\n\nThe goal is to form as many piles of 10 marbles as possible. To do this, we divide the total by 10 and find the remainder. The remainder represents the number of marbles that cannot form a complete pile of 10 and must be removed. \n\nCalculating \\(496 \\div 10\\):\n- \\(10 \\times 49 = 490\\),\n- \\(496 - 490 = 6\\).\n\nThis shows there are 6 marbles left over after forming 49 full piles of 10. Therefore, removing these 6 marbles ensures the remaining \\(490\\) marbles (which is \\(49 \\times 10\\)) can be perfectly divided into piles of 10. The answer is **6 marbles**, confirming the required removal.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, we need to choose two different prime numbers between 4 and 18. Then, subtract their sum from their product and see which of the options we can get. The answer is supposed to be 119, but I need to show why that's the case.\n\nFirst, let me list all the prime numbers between 4 and 18. Primes are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. Starting from 5 up to 17, the primes in that range are: 5, 7, 11, 13, 17. Wait, 19 is next, but the upper limit is 18, so stop at 17. So the primes are 5, 7, 11, 13, 17. These are the possible candidates.\n\nThe problem says two different primes, so we need to pick any two distinct ones from this list. Let's denote them as p and q. The expression we need to evaluate is pq - (p + q). The question is which of the options (22, 60, 119, 180, 231) can be obtained from this expression.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. Maybe compute pq - p - q for all possible pairs of these primes and see which of the options appear. Since there are 5 primes, the number of pairs is C(5,2) = 10 pairs. That's manageable.\n\nLet me list all possible pairs:\n\n1. 5 and 7\n2. 5 and 11\n3. 5 and 13\n4. 5 and 17\n5. 7 and 11\n6. 7 and 13\n7. 7 and 17\n8. 11 and 13\n9. 11 and 17\n10. 13 and 17\n\nNow, compute pq - (p + q) for each pair.\n\nStarting with 5 and 7:\n\n5*7 - (5+7) = 35 - 12 = 23. Not in the options.\n\n5 and 11:\n\n5*11 - (5+11) = 55 - 16 = 39. Not an option.\n\n5 and 13:\n\n5*13 - (5+13) = 65 - 18 = 47. Still not.\n\n5 and 17:\n\n5*17 - (5+17) = 85 - 22 = 63. Not in the options.\n\nNext pair: 7 and 11.\n\n7*11 - (7+11) = 77 - 18 = 59. Close to 60, but not exactly. Option B is 60. Hmm, 59 is not 60.\n\n7 and 13:\n\n7*13 - (7+13) = 91 - 20 = 71. Not an option.\n\n7 and 17:\n\n7*17 - (7+17) = 119 - 24 = 95. Not there.\n\nNow 11 and 13:\n\n11*13 - (11+13) = 143 - 24 = 119. Oh, that's option C. So this pair gives 119. So that's the answer. But let me check the remaining pairs to confirm if any other options are possible.\n\n11 and 17:\n\n11*17 - (11+17) = 187 - 28 = 159. Not in the options.\n\n13 and 17:\n\n13*17 - (13+17) = 221 - 30 = 191. Not listed either.\n\nSo the only pair that gives an option listed is 11 and 13, which gives 119. Therefore, the answer is C.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to be sure. For 11 and 13:\n\n11*13 is 143. Sum is 24. 143 -24 is indeed 119. Correct.\n\nAnother check: 7 and 11 gave 59, which is not 60. So option B is not possible. Similarly, other pairs don't hit the options. So 119 is the only one. Therefore, the answer is C.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo solve the problem, we first identify the prime numbers between 4 and 18: **5, 7, 11, 13, 17**.

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to calculate f(14, 52) given those properties. Hmm, the function f is defined on ordered pairs of positive integers and has three properties: f(x, x) = x, it's symmetric so f(x, y) = f(y, x), and there's this third property that (x + y)f(x, y) = y f(x, x + y). The goal is to show that f(14, 52) is 364. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what these properties imply. The third property seems like a recursive relation. If I can express f(x, y) in terms of f(x, x + y) or vice versa, maybe I can reduce the problem step by step. Since we have f(x, x) = x, maybe we can use the third property repeatedly to bring the arguments closer to each other until they become equal, then use the first property.\n\nLet me start with f(14, 52). Since 14 and 52 are not equal, I can apply the third property. Let's set x = 14 and y = 52. Then according to the third property:\n\n(14 + 52) f(14, 52) = 52 f(14, 14 + 52)  \nSo, 66 f(14, 52) = 52 f(14, 66)\n\nBut f(14, 66) is the same as f(66, 14) because of symmetry. Let's apply the third property again to f(66, 14). Let me switch them first: f(14, 66) = f(66, 14). Now, applying the third property to f(66, 14):\n\n(66 + 14) f(66, 14) = 14 f(66, 66 + 14)  \n80 f(66, 14) = 14 f(66, 80)\n\nSo substituting back into the previous equation:\n\n66 f(14, 52) = 52 * [14/80 f(66, 80)]  \nWait, maybe I should track each step more carefully. Let's redo that.\n\nFrom the first step: 66 f(14,52) = 52 f(14,66). Then f(14,66) = f(66,14). Applying the third property to f(66,14):\n\n(66 + 14) f(66,14) = 14 f(66, 80)  \nSo 80 f(66,14) = 14 f(66,80)  \nTherefore, f(66,14) = (14/80) f(66,80) = (7/40) f(66,80)\n\nSubstituting back into the first equation:\n\n66 f(14,52) = 52 * (7/40) f(66,80)  \nSimplify 52 * 7/40: 52 divided by 4 is 13, so 13 * 7 / 10 = 91/10. Wait, 52*7=364, 364/40=91/10. So 66 f(14,52) = (91/10) f(66,80)\n\nHmm, this seems messy. Maybe there's a better way. Let's see. Alternatively, maybe we can keep applying the third property until the second argument becomes a multiple of the first, or until we can reach a point where the arguments are equal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern here similar to the Euclidean algorithm. The third property resembles the steps in the Euclidean algorithm where you subtract the smaller number from the larger one. Let's see:\n\nIf we have (x + y) f(x,y) = y f(x, x + y). Wait, but x + y is larger than both x and y. So maybe we can reverse the process. Let's think of f(x, y) in terms of f(x, y - x) if y > x. Wait, but the third property gives a relation when you add x and y. Maybe we need to express f(x, y) in terms of f(x, x + y). But that seems like increasing the numbers. Maybe instead, we can use the property to reduce the problem step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps if we consider that f(x, y) can be related to f(x, y - x) when y > x. Let me try that. Let's suppose y > x. Then, perhaps we can write f(x, y) in terms of f(x, y - x). Let's see:\n\nStarting with the third property: (x + y) f(x, y) = y f(x, x + y). Wait, but if we have y > x, maybe we can set up a relation where we subtract x from y. Let me see. Let's suppose we have f(a, b) where a < b. Then, using the third property in reverse: maybe express f(a, b) in terms of f(a, b - a). Let's see:\n\nIf we have f(a, b - a), then according to the third property, (a + (b - a)) f(a, b - a) = (b - a) f(a, a + (b - a))  \nWhich simplifies to b f(a, b - a) = (b - a) f(a, b)  \nTherefore, f(a, b) = [b / (b - a)] f(a, b - a)\n\nWait, that's a useful relation. So if we have f(a, b) where b > a, then f(a, b) = [b / (b - a)] f(a, b - a). This seems similar to the Euclidean algorithm steps. So we can keep subtracting the smaller number from the larger one and adjust the function value accordingly.\n\nLet's apply this to f(14,52). Since 52 > 14, we can write:\n\nf(14,52) = [52 / (52 - 14)] f(14, 52 - 14)  \n= (52 / 38) f(14, 38)  \nSimplify 52/38: divide numerator and denominator by 2: 26/19.\n\nSo f(14,52) = (26/19) f(14,38)\n\nNow, f(14,38): again, 38 > 14, so apply the same step:\n\nf(14,38) = (38 / (38 -14)) f(14, 38 -14)  \n= (38 / 24) f(14,24)  \nSimplify 38/24: divide by 2: 19/12.\n\nSo f(14,38) = (19/12) f(14,24)\n\nNow f(14,24): 24 >14, so:\n\nf(14,24) = (24 / (24 -14)) f(14,24 -14)  \n= (24 /10) f(14,10)  \nSimplify 24/10 to 12/5.\n\nSo f(14,24) = (12/5) f(14,10)\n\nNow, f(14,10): since 14 >10, swap them using symmetry: f(14,10) = f(10,14). Now apply the same step to f(10,14):\n\nf(10,14) = (14 / (14 -10)) f(10,14 -10)  \n= (14 /4) f(10,4)  \n= (7/2) f(10,4)\n\nThen f(10,4): 10 >4, swap to f(4,10):\n\nf(4,10) = (10 / (10 -4)) f(4,10 -4)  \n= (10/6) f(4,6)  \n= (5/3) f(4,6)\n\nf(4,6): 6 >4, swap to f(4,6) = f(4,6). Apply the step:\n\nf(4,6) = (6 / (6 -4)) f(4,6 -4)  \n= (6/2) f(4,2)  \n= 3 f(4,2)\n\nf(4,2): 4 >2, swap to f(2,4):\n\nf(2,4) = (4 / (4 -2)) f(2,4 -2)  \n= (4/2) f(2,2)  \n= 2 f(2,2)\n\nBut f(2,2) =2 by the first property. So f(2,4) =2*2=4.\n\nNow backtracking:\n\nf(4,2) = f(2,4) =4  \nThen f(4,6) =3*4=12  \nf(4,10) = (5/3)*12 = 20  \nWait, wait: f(4,10) = (5/3) f(4,6) = (5/3)*12 = 20. Yes.  \nThen f(10,4) =20  \nSo f(10,14) = (7/2)*20 =70  \nThen f(14,10)=70  \nSo f(14,24)= (12/5)*70 = (12*14)=168? Wait, 12/5 *70 = (12*14) =168. Yes.  \nThen f(14,38)= (19/12)*168 = (19*14) =266  \nThen f(14,52)= (26/19)*266 = (26*14) =364. Because 266 divided by19 is 14 (since 19*14=266), so 26/19 *266 =26*14=364. \n\nYes! So that gives f(14,52)=364. \n\nThis process resembles the Euclidean algorithm steps, where we subtract the smaller number from the larger one repeatedly until we reach a pair where both numbers are equal. Each time we apply the third property, we reduce the problem to a smaller pair, and by keeping track of the coefficients, we can compute the final value. The key idea is using the recursive relation to break down the problem into smaller parts, leveraging the symmetry and the base case when the arguments are equal.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo compute \\( f(14, 52) \\), we utilize the given properties of the function \\( f \\). The key insight is to repeatedly apply the third property, which relates \\( f(x, y) \\) to \\( f(x, x + y) \\), effectively mimicking the steps of the Euclidean algorithm. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Start with \\( f(14, 52) \\):**  \n   By the third property:  \n   \\[\n   (14 + 52)f(14, 52) = 52f(14, 66) \\implies 66f(14, 52) = 52f(14, 66).\n   \\]  \n   Simplify to:  \n   \\[\n   f(14, 52) = \\frac{52}{66}f(14, 66) = \\frac{26}{33}f(14, 66).\n   \\]\n\n2. **Reduce \\( f(14, 66) \\):**  \n   Apply symmetry \\( f(14, 66) = f(66, 14) \\), then use the third property again:  \n   \\[\n   (66 + 14)f(66, 14) = 14f(66, 80) \\implies 80f(66, 14) = 14f(66, 80).\n   \\]  \n   Simplify to:  \n   \\[\n   f(66, 14) = \\frac{14}{80}f(66, 80) = \\frac{7}{40}f(66, 80).\n   \\]  \n   Substituting back:  \n   \\[\n   f(14, 52) = \\frac{26}{33} \\cdot \\frac{7}{40}f(66, 80).\n   \\]\n\n3. **Continue reducing recursively:**  \n   Repeat this process for \\( f(66, 80) \\), \\( f(66, 14) \\), and subsequent pairs. Each step reduces the arguments using the pattern \\( f(x, y) = \\frac{y}{y - x}f(x, y - x) \\) (derived from the third property). For example:  \n   - \\( f(14, 52) \\to f(14, 38) \\to f(14, 24) \\to f(14, 10) \\to f(10, 14) \\to \\dots \\)\n   - Eventually, reach base cases like \\( f(2, 2) = 2 \\).\n\n4. **Backtrack to compute the final value:**  \n   After fully reducing, substitute backward using the coefficients accumulated at each step. For instance:  \n   - \\( f(2, 4) = 2 \\cdot f(2, 2) = 4 \\),  \n   - \\( f(4, 6) = 3 \\cdot f(4, 2) = 12 \\),  \n   - \\( f(10, 14) = \\frac{7}{2} \\cdot f(10, 4) = 70 \\),  \n   - And so on, until \\( f(14, 52) = 364 \\).\n\n**Conclusion:** By iteratively applying the third property and symmetry, the problem reduces to simpler pairs until reaching base cases. Tracking the multiplicative factors at each step leads directly to \\( f(14, 52) = 364 \\).",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is asking to find the value of (16 times the cube root of a squared) raised to the power of 1/3, when a is 8. And we need to show that this equals 4. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I should substitute a with 8. So the expression becomes (16 * cube root of 8\u00b2)^(1/3). Let me break this down step by step. Let's compute the inner part first: the cube root of 8 squared. \n\nWait, 8 is 2 cubed, right? So 8\u00b2 would be (2\u00b3)\u00b2. Using exponent rules, that's 2^(3*2) = 2^6. Then the cube root of 2^6. The cube root is the same as raising to the 1/3 power. So (2^6)^(1/3) = 2^(6*(1/3)) = 2^2 = 4. So the cube root of 8 squared is 4.\n\nNow, multiply that by 16: 16 * 4 = 64. So now the expression is 64^(1/3). The cube root of 64. Since 4 cubed is 64, because 4*4=16, 16*4=64. So 64^(1/3) is 4. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 4. That matches what we needed to show.\n\nWait, let me check each step again to make sure I didn't skip anything. Starting with a=8. The original expression is (16 * cube_root(a\u00b2))^(1/3). Substitute a=8: cube_root(8\u00b2). 8 is 2\u00b3, so 8\u00b2 is (2\u00b3)\u00b2 = 2^6. Cube root of 2^6 is 2^(6/3) = 2\u00b2 = 4. Then 16*4=64. Then cube root of 64 is 4. Yep, that all checks out. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to approach it by manipulating exponents first before substituting. Let's see. The expression is (16 * a^(2/3))^(1/3). Since cube root of a squared is a^(2/3). Then multiply by 16, which is 2^4. So 2^4 * a^(2/3). Then raising that to the 1/3 power: (2^4 * a^(2/3))^(1/3) = 2^(4/3) * a^(2/9). Wait, but if a is 8, which is 2^3, then substituting gives 2^(4/3) * (2^3)^(2/9) = 2^(4/3) * 2^(6/9) = 2^(4/3 + 2/3) = 2^(6/3) = 2^2 = 4. That also works. So both methods lead to the same result. \n\nEither way, the key steps are recognizing that 8 is a power of 2, applying exponent rules to simplify the radicals and exponents, and then performing the arithmetic correctly. It's important to handle the exponents step by step to avoid mistakes. Also, remembering that when you raise a power to another power, you multiply the exponents. And when you multiply terms with the same base, you add the exponents. That's how the different steps combine to give the final result of 4.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nLet's start by substituting \\( a = 8 \\) into the expression \\( \\left(16\\sqrt[3]{a^2}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{3}} \\). This gives us:\n\\[\n\\left(16 \\cdot \\sqrt[3]{8^2}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{3}}.\n\\]\n\n**Step 1: Simplify \\( \\sqrt[3]{8^2} \\).**  \nSince \\( 8 = 2^3 \\), we can rewrite \\( 8^2 \\) as \\( (2^3)^2 = 2^{6} \\).

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. We need to find all functions f: \u2124 \u2192 \u2124 such that for any integers a and b, the equation f(2a) + 2f(b) = f(f(a + b)) holds. Hmm, functional equations can be tricky, but maybe we can find a pattern or assume a form for f and see if it fits.\n\nFirst, let's think about possible simple functions. Linear functions are often a good starting point. Suppose f is linear, so maybe f(x) = kx + c for some constants k and c. Let me test this.\n\nPlugging into the equation: f(2a) + 2f(b) = k(2a) + c + 2(kb + c) = 2ka + c + 2kb + 2c = 2k(a + b) + 3c. On the right side, f(f(a + b)) = f(k(a + b) + c) = k(k(a + b) + c) + c = k\u00b2(a + b) + kc + c. \n\nSet these equal: 2k(a + b) + 3c = k\u00b2(a + b) + kc + c. For this to hold for all a, b, the coefficients of (a + b) and the constants must match. So:\n\nCoefficients of (a + b): 2k = k\u00b2 \u21d2 k\u00b2 - 2k = 0 \u21d2 k(k - 2) = 0 \u21d2 k = 0 or k = 2.\n\nConstants: 3c = kc + c \u21d2 3c - kc - c = 0 \u21d2 (2 - k)c = 0.\n\nIf k = 0: Then from constants equation, (2 - 0)c = 2c = 0 \u21d2 c = 0. So f(x) = 0x + 0 = 0. Let's check if this works. f(2a) + 2f(b) = 0 + 0 = 0. f(f(a + b)) = f(0) = 0. So yes, it works.\n\nIf k = 2: Then constants equation gives (2 - 2)c = 0 \u21d2 0*c = 0, which is always true. So c can be any integer? Wait, but let's check. If k=2, then f(x) = 2x + c. Let's plug back into the original equation.\n\nLeft side: f(2a) + 2f(b) = 2*(2a) + c + 2*(2b + c) = 4a + c + 4b + 2c = 4(a + b) + 3c.\n\nRight side: f(f(a + b)) = f(2(a + b) + c) = 2*(2(a + b) + c) + c = 4(a + b) + 2c + c = 4(a + b) + 3c.\n\nSo both sides are equal. Therefore, f(x) = 2x + c works for any constant c. Wait, but the problem says \"all functions\". So maybe the general solution is f(x) = 2x + c where c is a constant integer. But wait, the case when k=0 gives f(x)=0, which is also 2x + c with c=0. So that's included. So all linear functions of the form f(x) = 2x + c satisfy the equation. Are there any non-linear solutions?\n\nHmm, maybe we need to check if there are other functions. Let's suppose f is not linear. Let's try to find constraints.\n\nLet me set a = 0. Then the equation becomes f(0) + 2f(b) = f(f(b)). Let's denote this as equation (1).\n\nSimilarly, set b = 0: f(2a) + 2f(0) = f(f(a)). Let's call this equation (2).\n\nAlso, set a + b = 0. Let\u2019s set b = -a. Then the original equation becomes f(2a) + 2f(-a) = f(f(0)). Let's call this equation (3).\n\nHmm, maybe we can use these equations to find relations.\n\nFrom equation (1): f(f(b)) = 2f(b) + f(0). Let's denote c = f(0). Then f(f(b)) = 2f(b) + c.\n\nSimilarly, equation (2): f(f(a)) = f(2a) + 2c.\n\nBut from equation (1), f(f(a)) = 2f(a) + c. So combining equation (2) and equation (1):\n\n2f(a) + c = f(2a) + 2c \u21d2 f(2a) = 2f(a) - c.\n\nSo f(2a) is expressed in terms of f(a). Let's note that.\n\nNow, let's try to find f in terms of a linear function. Suppose f is linear, which we already did, but maybe even if it's not, we can use this relation.\n\nSuppose we let a be arbitrary. Let\u2019s consider f(2a) = 2f(a) - c. If we can express f(2a) in terms of f(a), maybe recursively.\n\nIf we assume f is linear, then f(2a) = 2k a + c. But according to the equation, f(2a) = 2(k a + c) - c = 2k a + 2c - c = 2k a + c. Which matches. So that's consistent.\n\nBut what if f is not linear? Let's suppose f is affine, but maybe with some other terms. Wait, but maybe the only solutions are linear functions. Let's see.\n\nSuppose we define f(x) = 2x + c. Then as we saw, it works. What if there's a function that's not linear? For example, suppose f(x) = 2x + c when x is even, and something else when x is odd. But then the equation has to hold for all a and b. Let's test such a case.\n\nBut maybe we can show that f must be linear. Let's try to see.\n\nFrom equation (1): f(f(b)) = 2f(b) + c. Let's denote y = f(b), so f(y) = 2y + c. Wait, this is a functional equation for f: f(y) = 2y + c for all y in the image of f. So if every integer y can be written as f(b) for some b, then f(y) = 2y + c for all y \u2208 \u2124. But that would mean f is linear. However, the image of f might not be all of \u2124. So maybe f is linear on its image.\n\nBut if f is not surjective, then perhaps there are other possibilities. Wait, but the problem states f: \u2124 \u2192 \u2124. So the domain and codomain are all integers. Let's think.\n\nSuppose that for some y, y is not in the image of f. Then the equation f(y) = 2y + c only applies when y is in the image. But if y is not in the image, then we don't have a constraint from that equation. However, the original functional equation must hold for all a and b. Let's see if we can find contradictions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can show that f must be linear everywhere. Let's proceed step by step.\n\nFrom equation (1): f(f(b)) = 2f(b) + c, where c = f(0).\n\nFrom equation (2): f(f(a)) = f(2a) + 2c. But from equation (1), f(f(a)) = 2f(a) + c. Therefore:\n\n2f(a) + c = f(2a) + 2c \u21d2 f(2a) = 2f(a) - c.\n\nSo f(2a) is determined by f(a). Let's try to compute f(0). Let a = 0 in equation (2):\n\nf(0) + 2c = f(f(0)). But c = f(0), so:\n\nc + 2c = f(c) \u21d2 3c = f(c).\n\nBut from equation (1), f(f(b)) = 2f(b) + c. Let b be such that f(b) = c. Then f(c) = 2c + c = 3c. Which matches. So that's consistent.\n\nNow, let's try to find f(1). Let's set a = 1 in equation (2): f(2) + 2c = f(f(1)). But f(2) = 2f(1) - c (from f(2a) = 2f(a) - c with a=1). So:\n\n2f(1) - c + 2c = f(f(1)) \u21d2 2f(1) + c = f(f(1)).\n\nBut from equation (1), f(f(1)) = 2f(1) + c. So this holds. So no new information here.\n\nLet's try to find a general form. Suppose we let x be any integer. Let's set a = x and b = 0 in the original equation:\n\nf(2x) + 2f(0) = f(f(x)).\n\nBut from equation (1), f(f(x)) = 2f(x) + c. Also, from earlier, f(2x) = 2f(x) - c. So substituting:\n\n(2f(x) - c) + 2c = 2f(x) + c \u21d2 2f(x) + c = 2f(x) + c. Which is always true. So this doesn't give new info.\n\nAlternatively, let's set b = x in the original equation. Then for any a, f(2a) + 2f(x) = f(f(a + x)).\n\nBut f(2a) = 2f(a) - c. So:\n\n2f(a) - c + 2f(x) = f(f(a + x)).\n\nHmm, not sure. Let's try to set a = x and b = -x. Then the original equation becomes f(2x) + 2f(-x) = f(f(0)).\n\nBut f(2x) = 2f(x) - c, and f(f(0)) = f(c) = 2c + c = 3c (from equation (1), since f(0) = c). So:\n\n2f(x) - c + 2f(-x) = 3c \u21d2 2f(x) + 2f(-x) = 4c \u21d2 f(x) + f(-x) = 2c.\n\nThis gives a relation between f(x) and f(-x). If f is linear, say f(x) = 2x + c, then f(-x) = -2x + c, so f(x) + f(-x) = 2c, which matches. So this holds.\n\nBut does this relation help us find f? Let's see.\n\nSuppose we let x = n be a positive integer and try to express f(n) in terms of previous values. For example, let's compute f(1), f(2), etc.\n\nFrom f(2a) = 2f(a) - c. Let a = 1: f(2) = 2f(1) - c.\n\nSimilarly, a = 2: f(4) = 2f(2) - c = 2(2f(1) - c) - c = 4f(1) - 3c.\n\nBut without knowing f(1), this doesn't help. Maybe we need another approach.\n\nAlternatively, let's assume that f is linear. We already saw that f(x) = 2x + c works. Are there other solutions?\n\nSuppose there's a function f that's not linear. Let's assume f(x) = 2x + c + d(x), where d(x) is some function that's not zero. Let's plug into the equation and see if d(x) must be zero.\n\nOriginal equation: f(2a) + 2f(b) = f(f(a + b)).\n\nExpressed with d(x):\n\n[2(2a) + c + d(2a)] + 2[2b + c + d(b)] = f(f(a + b)).\n\nLeft side: 4a + c + d(2a) + 4b + 2c + 2d(b) = 4(a + b) + 3c + d(2a) + 2d(b).\n\nRight side: f(f(a + b)) = f(2(a + b) + c + d(a + b)) = 2[2(a + b) + c + d(a + b)] + c + d(2(a + b) + c + d(a + b)).\n\nSimplify right side:\n\n4(a + b) + 2c + 2d(a + b) + c + d(2(a + b) + c + d(a + b)).\n\nCombine terms: 4(a + b) + 3c + 2d(a + b) + d(2(a + b) + c + d(a + b)).\n\nSet left and right equal:\n\n4(a + b) + 3c + d(2a) + 2d(b) = 4(a + b) + 3c + 2d(a + b) + d(2(a + b) + c + d(a + b)).\n\nSubtract 4(a + b) + 3c from both sides:\n\nd(2a) + 2d(b) = 2d(a + b) + d(2(a + b) + c + d(a + b)).\n\nThis looks complicated. For this to hold for all a, b, the d terms must cancel out. If d is zero, then both sides are zero. If d is non-zero, this equation must hold. But it's hard to see how unless d is zero. Therefore, perhaps the only solutions are linear functions f(x) = 2x + c.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a non-linear solution. Let's test a specific example. Suppose c=0, so f(x)=2x. Then the equation holds. What if we take f(x) = 2x + 1. Let's check:\n\nLeft side: f(2a) + 2f(b) = 2*(2a) +1 + 2*(2b +1) =4a +1 +4b +2=4a +4b +3.\n\nRight side: f(f(a + b)) = f(2(a + b) +1) =2*(2(a + b) +1) +1=4(a + b) +2 +1=4(a + b) +3. Which matches. So yes, works.\n\nWhat if we take f(x) = 2x + c for any c. Then as shown earlier, it works. So these are solutions.\n\nBut are there others? Suppose f(x) = 2x + c for even x and something else for odd x. Let's see. Let\u2019s take c=0 for simplicity. Suppose f(x) = 2x when x is even, and f(x) = 2x +1 when x is odd. Let's test the equation.\n\nTake a=1 (odd), b=1 (odd). Then f(2a)=f(2)=4 (since 2 is even). 2f(b)=2*(2*1 +1)=2*3=6. Left side:4+6=10.\n\nRight side: f(f(a + b))=f(f(2))=f(4)=8. But 10 \u22608. So this function doesn't work. Hence, such a piecewise function isn't a solution.\n\nAnother example: suppose f(x) =2x + c(x), where c(x) is periodic with period 2. Let's say c(x) alternates between 0 and 1. Then similar issues would arise. So likely, the only solutions are linear functions of the form f(x)=2x +c.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that all such functions are linear functions of the form f(x) = 2x + c where c is a constant integer.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo determine all functions \\( f: \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\) satisfying \\( f(2a) + 2f(b) = f(f(a + b)) \\) for all integers \\( a, b \\), we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Assume a linear form**: Start by hypothesizing \\( f(x) = 2x + c \\), where \\( c \\) is a constant. Substitute into the equation:\n   - Left-hand side (LHS): \\( f(2a) + 2f(b) = 4a + c + 4b + 2c = 4(a + b) + 3c \\).\n   - Right-hand side (RHS): \\( f(f(a + b)) = f(2(a + b) + c) = 4(a + b) + 3c \\).\n   Both sides match, confirming that \\( f(x) = 2x + c \\) satisfies the equation for any constant \\( c \\).\n\n2. **Verify uniqueness of solutions**:\n   - **Key constraints**: By setting \\( a = 0 \\), we derive \\( f(0) + 2f(b) = f(f(b)) \\). Letting \\( c = f(0) \\), this simplifies to \\( f(f(b)) = 2f(b) + c \\).\n   - **Recursive relation**: Setting \\( b = 0 \\), we get \\( f(2a) + 2c = f(f(a)) \\). Combining with the earlier result, this implies \\( f(2a) = 2f(a) - c \\).\n   - **Symmetry**: Setting \\( b = -a \\), we find \\( f(2a) + 2f(-a) = 3c \\), leading to \\( f(a) + f(-a) = 2c \\). This symmetry aligns with the linear form \\( f(x) = 2x + c \\).\n\n3. **Exclude non-linear solutions**:\n   - Suppose \\( f \\) has a non-linear term \\( d(x) \\). Substituting \\( f(x) = 2x + c + d(x) \\) into the original equation creates contradictions unless \\( d(x) = 0 \\) for all \\( x \\). Piecewise or periodic modifications to \\( f(x) \\) also fail to satisfy the equation universally.\n\nThus, the only solutions are linear functions of the form \\( f(x) = 2x + c \\), where \\( c \\) is a fixed integer constant. These functions satisfy the given functional equation for all \\( a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\).",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is to find the ordered pair (a, b) that satisfies both equations 3a + 2b = 5 and a + b = 2, and show that it's (1,1). Hmm. So, this is a system of linear equations. I remember that to solve such systems, you can use substitution or elimination. Let me think about which method would work here.\n\nFirst, maybe substitution. Since the second equation is a + b = 2, I can solve for one variable in terms of the other. Let's solve for a. So, a = 2 - b. Then substitute this into the first equation. That would replace a with (2 - b) in 3a + 2b =5. Let's check that:\n\n3*(2 - b) + 2b =5. Expanding that gives 6 - 3b + 2b =5. Combine like terms: 6 - b =5. Then subtract 6 from both sides: -b = -1, so b=1. Then plug back into a =2 - b, so a=2-1=1. So (1,1) is the solution. That seems straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, using elimination. If I have the two equations:\n\n3a + 2b =5\n\na + b =2\n\nMaybe multiply the second equation by 2 to make the coefficients of b's match? Wait, 2*(a + b) =2*2 \u2192 2a +2b=4. Then subtract that from the first equation: (3a +2b) - (2a +2b)=5-4 \u2192 a=1. Then substitute a=1 into the second equation:1 +b=2 \u2192 b=1. So again, (1,1).\n\nBut wait, the problem says to \"show that it is (1,1)\", so maybe they want verification as well. Let's check if (1,1) satisfies both equations. Plug into first equation:3*1 +2*1=3+2=5, which matches. Second equation:1+1=2, which also matches. So yes, it works.\n\nBut maybe there's a case where there are multiple solutions, but since these are two linear equations with two variables, and they are not parallel lines, there should be exactly one solution. The determinant here would be 3*1 -2*1=3-2=1, which is non-zero, so the system has a unique solution. Hence, (1,1) is the only solution.\n\nWait, the context given earlier was about linear Diophantine equations. The example solved 2x +3y=4. But in this problem, the equations are 3a +2b=5 and a +b=2. Diophantine equations are about integer solutions, but here since the coefficients are integers and the constants are integers, and we're looking for integer solutions (since a and b are ordered pairs, presumably integers?), but in this case, the solution is (1,1), which are integers. So maybe the problem is a system of linear Diophantine equations. But the previous example used the method of finding gcd and then expressing solutions parametrically. However, in this problem, since there are two equations, the approach is different. The previous example was a single equation, but here we have two equations, so the solution is unique. So maybe the user wants to see the substitution or elimination method applied here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they want to use the theory from the context. Let me check the context again. The context was solving a linear Diophantine equation 2x +3y=4 by finding a particular solution and then the general solution. But in the current problem, there are two equations, so it's a system, not a single equation. So the approach would be different. The previous example's method isn't directly applicable here. So perhaps the user just wants a straightforward solving of the system, showing that (1,1) is the solution. So substitution or elimination would be the way to go.\n\nBut maybe the problem expects more detailed steps. Let me outline the steps again. First, solve one of the equations for one variable. Let's take the second equation a + b =2. Solving for a gives a=2 -b. Substitute this into the first equation: 3*(2 -b) +2b=5. Then expand: 6 -3b +2b=5 \u2192 6 -b=5 \u2192 -b= -1 \u2192 b=1. Then substitute back to find a=1. Then verify in both equations. That's the substitution method.\n\nAlternatively, elimination. Multiply the second equation by 3 to make the coefficients of a the same. So:\n\nOriginal equations:\n\n3a +2b=5\n\na +b=2\n\nMultiply the second equation by 3: 3a +3b=6. Then subtract the first equation from this: (3a +3b) - (3a +2b)=6-5 \u2192 b=1. Then substitute back into a +b=2 \u2192 a=1. So same result.\n\nEither method works. The key is to show the steps leading to a=1 and b=1, then verify that these values satisfy both equations. Since the problem states to show that the solution is (1,1), the proof would involve solving the system and confirming the solution.\n\nI think that's all. The problem is straightforward, but maybe the user wants a clear explanation of each step. So in the informal proof, explain substitution or elimination, show the steps, and verify the solution.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo find the ordered pair \\((a, b)\\) that satisfies both equations \\(3a + 2b = 5\\) and \\(a + b = 2\\), we can use the method of substitution.

Solving for \\(a\\), we get:  \n   \\[\n   a = 2 - b.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Substitute into the other equation**:  \n   Plug \\(a = 2 - b\\) into the first equation \\(3a + 2b = 5\\):  \n   \\[\n   3(2 - b) + 2b = 5.\n   \\]  \n   Expand and simplify:  \n   \\[\n   6 - 3b + 2b = 5 \\implies 6 - b = 5.\n   \\]  \n   Solving for \\(b\\), we subtract 6 from both sides:  \n   \\[\n   -b = -1 \\implies b = 1.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Find the value of \\(a\\)**:  \n   Substitute \\(b = 1\\) back into \\(a = 2 - b\\):  \n   \\[\n   a = 2 - 1 = 1.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Verify the solution**:  \n   Check that \\((a, b) = (1, 1)\\) satisfies both original equations:  \n   - For \\(3a + 2b = 5\\):  \n     \\[\n     3(1) + 2(1) = 3 + 2 = 5.\n     \\]  \n   - For \\(a + b = 2\\):  \n     \\[\n     1 + 1 = 2.\n     \\]  \n   Both equations hold true.\n\nSince the system of equations has a unique solution (the lines intersect at exactly one point), \\((1, 1)\\) is the only ordered pair that satisfies both equations. This completes the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is asking for the value of f(g(2)) where f(x) = x + 1 and g(x) = x\u00b2 + 3. And we need to show that it's 8. Alright, so first, I need to remember how function composition works. So f(g(2)) means I first apply g to 2, and then apply f to the result of that.\n\nSo let's start with g(2). The function g is defined as g(x) = x squared plus 3. So plugging in 2 for x, that would be 2 squared plus 3. 2 squared is 4, so 4 plus 3 is 7. So g(2) equals 7. Then, f(g(2)) is f(7). Now, f(x) is x plus 1, so plugging in 7, that's 7 plus 1, which is 8. So f(g(2)) should be 8. That seems straightforward.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check if there's any trick here. Like, maybe the functions are defined differently or there's some order of operations I'm missing. Let me double-check. The functions are given as f(x) = x + 1 and g(x) = x\u00b2 + 3. So substituting 2 into g first, then taking that result into f. Yeah, that's right. So 2 squared is 4, plus 3 is 7. Then 7 plus 1 is 8. Hmm, seems correct.\n\nIs there another way to approach this? Maybe by composing the functions first and then evaluating? Let's see. If f(g(x)) is the composition, then f(g(x)) = f(x\u00b2 + 3) = (x\u00b2 + 3) + 1 = x\u00b2 + 4. Then plugging in x = 2, that's 2\u00b2 + 4 = 4 + 4 = 8. Oh, that's another way to get the same result. So both methods give 8. That confirms it.\n\nI guess the key steps here are understanding function composition and correctly substituting the values. First, compute the inner function g(2), then use that result as the input for f. Alternatively, compose the functions first and then substitute. Either way, the answer is 8. There's no ambiguity in the functions' definitions, so the steps are pretty straightforward. Just making sure there's no arithmetic errors. Let me check again: 2 squared is 4, plus 3 is 7. Then 7 plus 1 is 8. Yep, that's right. So the value of f(g(2)) is indeed 8.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo find the value of \\( f(g(2)) \\) where \\( f(x) = x + 1 \\) and \\( g(x) = x^2 + 3 \\), we proceed step-by-step:\n\n1. **Compute \\( g(2) \\):**  \n   Substitute \\( x = 2 \\) into \\( g(x) \\):  \n   \\[\n   g(2) = (2)^2 + 3 = 4 + 3 = 7.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Substitute \\( g(2) \\) into \\( f(x) \\):**  \n   Now use \\( g(2) = 7 \\) as the input for \\( f(x) \\):  \n   \\[\n   f(g(2)) = f(7) = 7 + 1 = 8.\n   \\]\n\n**Alternative verification:**  \nAlternatively, compose \\( f \\) and \\( g \\) first:  \n\\[\nf(g(x)) = f(x^2 + 3) = (x^2 + 3) + 1 = x^2 + 4.\n\\]  \nThen substitute \\( x = 2 \\):  \n\\[\nf(g(2)) = (2)^2 + 4 = 4 + 4 = 8.\n\\]\n\nBoth methods confirm that \\( f(g(2)) = 8 \\).",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this arithmetic sequence problem. So, the problem says that the 7th term is 30 and the 11th term is 60, and we need to find the 21st term and show it's 135. Hmm, arithmetic sequences have a common difference between consecutive terms. Let me recall the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence.\n\nThe general formula for the nth term, a_n, is a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d, where a_1 is the first term and d is the common difference. Right. So, given that the 7th term is 30, that would be a_7 = a_1 + 6d = 30. Similarly, the 11th term is 60, so a_11 = a_1 + 10d = 60. \n\nNow, we have two equations here:\n\n1. a_1 + 6d = 30\n2. a_1 + 10d = 60\n\nI need to solve these two equations to find a_1 and d. Maybe subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate a_1. Let's see: (a_1 + 10d) - (a_1 + 6d) = 60 - 30. That simplifies to 4d = 30, so d = 30/4 = 7.5. Wait, 30 divided by 4 is 7.5? Let me check that again. 60 minus 30 is 30, and 10d minus 6d is 4d. So 4d = 30, so d = 7.5. Hmm, that seems correct. So the common difference is 7.5.\n\nNow, substitute d back into one of the equations to find a_1. Let's use the first equation: a_1 + 6*(7.5) = 30. 6 times 7.5 is 45. So a_1 = 30 - 45 = -15. Wait, that's negative. That's okay, arithmetic sequences can have negative first terms. So a_1 is -15.\n\nNow, we need to find the 21st term. Using the formula again: a_21 = a_1 + 20d. Plugging in the values: a_21 = -15 + 20*(7.5). Let's compute 20 times 7.5. 7.5 times 20 is 150. So -15 + 150 = 135. There we go, that's 135. So the 21st term is indeed 135. Let me just double-check the steps to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. The difference between the 11th and 7th term is 4d = 30, so d=7.5. Then a_1 is 30 - 6*7.5 = 30 -45 = -15. Then 21st term is -15 +20*7.5= -15+150=135. Yep, that all checks out.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nLet's start by recalling that in an arithmetic sequence, each term increases by a constant difference \\( d \\). The \\( n \\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence can be expressed as:\n\\[\na_n = a_1 + (n-1)d\n\\]\nwhere \\( a_1 \\) is the first term.\n\nWe are given:\n- The 7th term (\\( a_7 \\)) is 30.\n- The 11th term (\\( a_{11} \\)) is 60.\n\nUsing the formula for the \\( n \\)-th term, we write two equations:\n1. \\( a_1 + 6d = 30 \\) (since \\( a_7 = a_1 + 6d \\))\n2. \\( a_1 + 10d = 60 \\) (since \\( a_{11} = a_1 + 10d \\))\n\n**Step 1: Find the common difference \\( d \\).**  \nSubtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \\( a_1 \\):\n\\[\n(a_1 + 10d) - (a_1 + 6d) = 60 - 30\n\\]\nSimplifying:\n\\[\n4d = 30 \\implies d = 7.5\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Find the first term \\( a_1 \\).**  \nSubstitute \\( d = 7.5 \\) into the first equation:\n\\[\na_1 + 6(7.5) = 30 \\implies a_1 + 45 = 30 \\implies a_1 = -15\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the 21st term (\\( a_{21} \\)).**  \nUsing the formula \\( a_{21} = a_1 + 20d \\):\n\\[\na_{21} = -15 + 20(7.5) = -15 + 150 = 135\n\\]\n\nThus, the 21st term of the arithmetic sequence is **135**. The key steps involved solving for the common difference \\( d \\), determining the first term \\( a_1 \\), and applying the arithmetic sequence formula to the desired term.\nPrevious attempt failed with: linarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase h1.h\na d : \u211d\nh\u2080 : a + 6 * d = 30\nh\u2081 : a + 10 * d = 60\na\u271d : d < 7.5\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: linarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase h1.h\na d : \u211d\nh\u2080 : a + 6 * d = 30\nh\u2081 : a + 10 * d = 60\na\u271d : d < 7.5\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: linarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase h1.h\na d : \u211d\nh\u2080 : a + 6 * d = 30\nh\u2081 : a + 10 * d = 60\na\u271d : d < 7.5\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to find f(84) for this function. The function is defined recursively, so I need to understand how it works step by step. \n\nFirst, the function f(n) has two cases. If n is 1000 or greater, then f(n) is just n minus 3. That's straightforward. But if n is less than 1000, then f(n) is equal to f(f(n+5)). Hmm, that's a bit more complicated because it's nested. So for n < 1000, we have to compute f(n+5) first and then apply f again to the result.\n\nLet's start with n = 84. Since 84 is less than 1000, we use the second case: f(84) = f(f(84 + 5)) = f(f(89)). Now I need to compute f(89). Again, 89 is less than 1000, so f(89) = f(f(89 + 5)) = f(f(94)). This seems like a pattern where each time, the argument increases by 5 until it reaches 1000 or more. Let's see where this leads.\n\nContinuing this process: f(94) = f(f(99)), then f(99) = f(f(104)). Now, 104 is still less than 1000, so f(104) = f(f(109)). Wait, but 104 +5 is 109, which is still under 1000. This seems like it's going to take a lot of steps. Maybe there's a pattern here where each time we add 5 until we get to 1000 or above. Let's see how many steps that would take.\n\nStarting from 84, each step adds 5. Let's calculate how many steps to reach 1000. The difference between 1000 and 84 is 916. Dividing 916 by 5 gives 183.2, so we need 184 steps to get past 1000. Wait, but each step adds 5, so starting at 84, after k steps, the number would be 84 + 5k. We need 84 +5k >= 1000. Solving for k: 5k >= 916 \u2192 k >= 183.2, so k=184. Then 84 +5*184 = 84 + 920 = 1004. So when we reach 1004, which is over 1000, then f(1004) = 1004 -3 = 1001. Then we have to work our way back through all those function calls. But this seems tedious. Maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can find a general formula for n < 1000. Let's think recursively. Suppose for some n < 1000, f(n) = f(f(n+5)). If we can express f(n+5) in terms of f(n+10), and so on, until we reach a point where n+5k >= 1000. Let's denote that when n +5k >=1000, then f(n+5k) = (n+5k) -3. Then f(n+5(k-1)) = f(f(n+5(k-1)+5)) = f(f(n+5k)). But since n+5k >=1000, f(n+5k) = (n+5k)-3. So f(n+5(k-1)) = f((n+5k)-3). Now, we need to check if (n+5k)-3 is still >=1000. If it is, then f((n+5k)-3) = (n+5k -3) -3 = n+5k -6. But if (n+5k)-3 is less than 1000, then we have to apply the recursive case again. Wait, this might get complicated. Let's try with our example.\n\nStarting with n=84. Let's find the smallest k where 84 +5k >=1000. As before, k=184 gives 84+5*184=1004. So f(84) = f(f(89)) = f(f(f(94))) = ... and so on until we get to f(1004) = 1001. Then working backwards: f(1004)=1001. Then f(999 +5) = f(1004) =1001, so f(999) = f(f(1004))=f(1001)=1001-3=998. Then f(994) = f(f(999))=f(998). Now, 998 is less than 1000, so f(998)=f(f(1003)). f(1003)=1003-3=1000. Then f(998)=f(1000). 1000 is >=1000, so f(1000)=1000-3=997. Therefore, f(998)=997. Then f(994)=f(997). 997 is less than 1000, so f(997)=f(f(1002)). f(1002)=1002-3=999. So f(997)=f(999). We already found f(999)=998. So f(997)=998. Then f(994)=f(997)=998. Wait, this seems like it's getting somewhere. Let me try to track this step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern where once you reach a number >=1000, you subtract 3, and then each step back subtracts 2? Because when you have f(n) = f(f(n+5)), and once n+5k >=1000, then f(n+5k) = n+5k -3. Then f(n+5(k-1)) = f(n+5k -3). If n+5k -3 >=1000, then f(n+5k -3) = (n+5k -3) -3 = n+5k -6. Then f(n+5(k-1)) = n+5k -6. But if n+5k -3 is still less than 1000, then we have to go further. Wait, but in our case, starting from 84, adding 5*184 gives 1004. Then 1004-3=1001, which is still >=1000, so f(1004)=1001. Then f(999) = f(f(1004))=f(1001)=1001-3=998. Then f(994)=f(f(999))=f(998). Now, 998 is less than 1000, so f(998)=f(f(1003)). f(1003)=1000, so f(998)=f(1000)=997. Then f(994)=f(997). f(997)=f(f(1002))=f(999)=998. So f(994)=998. Then f(989)=f(f(994))=f(998)=997. Hmm, this seems like a pattern where every time we subtract 5 from the original n, the result alternates between 998 and 997? Let's check.\n\nWait, let's track this step by step for n=84. Let's list the steps:\n\nf(84) = f(f(89))\nf(89) = f(f(94))\nf(94) = f(f(99))\nf(99) = f(f(104))\n...\nThis continues until we reach a number >=1000. Let's find the first n where n+5k >=1000. Starting at 84, adding 5 each time. Let's compute how many steps needed:\n\n1000 -84 = 916. 916 /5 = 183.2, so 184 steps. So 84 +5*184 =84 +920=1004. So the first time we hit >=1000 is at 1004. Then f(1004)=1004-3=1001.\n\nNow, working backwards:\n\nThe last step before 1004 would be 1004-5=999. So f(999) = f(f(1004))=f(1001)=1001-3=998.\n\nThen f(999) =998.\n\nThen the previous step was f(994) = f(f(999))=f(998). Now, f(998) = f(f(1003)). f(1003)=1003-3=1000. So f(998)=f(1000)=1000-3=997.\n\nSo f(994)=f(998)=997.\n\nThen f(989)=f(f(994))=f(997). Now, f(997)=f(f(1002)). f(1002)=1002-3=999. So f(997)=f(999)=998.\n\nSo f(989)=f(997)=998.\n\nThen f(984)=f(f(989))=f(998)=997.\n\nContinuing this pattern, each time we subtract 5 from the original n, the result alternates between 998 and 997. For example:\n\nn=1004: 1001\n\nn=999:998\n\nn=994:997\n\nn=989:998\n\nn=984:997\n\n...\n\nSo when n is 84, which is 84 = 1004 -5*184. Wait, but how does this pattern apply? Let's see how many steps back from 1004 to 84. Since we added 5 each time 184 steps to get to 1004, then going back each step subtracts 5. So starting from 1004 (step 184), step 183 is 999, step 182 is 994, etc., down to step 0 which is 84.\n\nNow, the values alternate between 1001, 998, 997, 998, 997, etc. Wait, but let's see:\n\nAt step 184 (n=1004): 1001\n\nstep 183 (n=999): f(999)=998\n\nstep 182 (n=994): f(994)=997\n\nstep 181 (n=989): f(989)=998\n\nstep 180 (n=984): f(984)=997\n\n...\n\nSo the pattern is that for even steps (from the top), we get 997, and for odd steps, 998? Wait, but how does this pattern continue? Let's see:\n\nstep 184:1001 (but this is the starting point)\n\nstep 183:998\n\nstep 182:997\n\nstep 181:998\n\nstep 180:997\n\nSo every two steps back, it alternates between 997 and 998. So starting from step 183 (n=999) which is 998, then step 182 (n=994) is 997, step 181 (n=989) is 998, step 180 (n=984) is 997, etc.\n\nNow, the question is, when we get back to n=84, which is step 0, what is the value?\n\nWe need to determine whether the step number (from 0 to 184) is even or odd in the pattern. Let's see:\n\nTotal steps from 84 to 1004 is 184 steps. So when we work backwards, starting from step 184 (n=1004) with value 1001, then step 183 (n=999) is 998, step 182 (n=994) is 997, step 181 (n=989) is 998, etc.\n\nThe pattern after step 184 is:\n\nstep 184:1001\n\nstep 183:998\n\nstep 182:997\n\nstep 181:998\n\nstep 180:997\n\n...\n\nSo from step 183 onwards, the pattern alternates between 998 and 997 every step. So step 183 (odd) is 998, step 182 (even) is 997, step 181 (odd) is 998, step 180 (even) is 997, etc.\n\nBut wait, the steps from 184 down to 0: step 184 is the first one (n=1004), step 183 is next (n=999), etc., down to step 0 (n=84). So the number of steps from 84 to 1004 is 184 steps. Therefore, when working backwards, step 0 (n=84) corresponds to step 184 in the forward direction. But the values after step 184 (n=1004) start with 1001, then step 183 is 998, step 182 is 997, etc.\n\nBut how does this pattern translate to the value of f(84)? Let's see:\n\nThe total number of steps from n=84 to reach >=1000 is 184 steps. Then, when working back, each step corresponds to a function evaluation. The value at step 184 is 1001. Then step 183 (n=999) is 998, step 182 (n=994) is 997, step 181 (n=989) is 998, step 180 (n=984) is 997, and so on.\n\nNow, the pattern from step 183 onwards is alternating between 998 and 997. The question is, for step 0 (n=84), which is 184 steps away from 1004, what is the value?\n\nBut wait, step 184 is n=1004, step 183 is n=999, step 182 is n=994, ..., step 0 is n=84. So the number of steps from n=84 to n=1004 is 184 steps. Each step back (from 184 to 0) decreases by 5. Now, the values after step 184 (n=1004) start with 1001, then step 183 (n=999) is 998, step 182 (n=994) is 997, step 181 (n=989) is 998, etc.\n\nSo the pattern after step 184 is:\n\nstep 184:1001\n\nstep 183:998\n\nstep 182:997\n\nstep 181:998\n\nstep 180:997\n\n...\n\nSo starting from step 183, the pattern alternates between 998 and 997 every step. Now, the total number of steps from step 183 down to step 0 is 183 steps. So step 183 is the first step after reaching 1004, and step 0 is the original n=84.\n\nNow, the pattern from step 183 to step 0 is alternating between 998 and 997. Since there are 183 steps from step 183 to step 0, we need to determine whether 183 is even or odd. 183 is odd. So starting at step 183 (value 998), each pair of steps would alternate. But since it's odd, the number of alternations would be such that the last step (step 0) would be 997.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Let's model the pattern. Let's say starting at step 183 (value 998), then step 182 is 997, step 181 is 998, step 180 is 997, ..., until step 0. Each step alternates. So the parity of the step number (from 183 down to 0) determines the value. Let's index the steps from 183 (index 0) to step 0 (index 183). Wait, maybe not. Let's see:\n\nStarting at step 183 (index 0) with value 998.\n\nEach subsequent step (index 1, 2, ..., 183) alternates between 997 and 998.\n\nSo for index i (starting at 0 for step 183), if i is even, the value is 998, if odd, 997? Or vice versa? Let's check:\n\nstep 183 (index 0):998\n\nstep 182 (index 1):997\n\nstep 181 (index 2):998\n\nstep 180 (index 3):997\n\n...\n\nSo the pattern is that for even indices (0,2,4,...), the value is 998, and for odd indices (1,3,5,...), it's 997. But the total number of steps from 183 to 0 is 184 steps (since 183 -0 +1 =184). Wait, no, from step 183 down to step 0, that's 184 steps (including both ends). Wait, but step 183 is the first one after step 184. So the total number of steps from step 183 to step 0 is 184 steps. Wait, no: step numbers go from 184 (n=1004) down to 0 (n=84). So steps from 184 to 0: total of 185 steps. But perhaps this is getting too confusing.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the number of times we apply the function. Each time we go down by 5, starting from 1004, until we reach 84. The number of steps is 184 steps (since 1004-84=920, divided by 5 is 184). So from 1004 down to 84, each step subtracts 5, 184 times.\n\nNow, the value at 1004 is 1001. Then at 999, it's 998. At 994, it's 997. At 989, 998. At 984, 997. So every time we subtract 5, the value alternates between 998 and 997. So starting from 1004 (value 1001), then 999 (998), 994 (997), 989 (998), 984 (997), etc. So every two steps (subtracting 10), the pattern repeats.\n\nBut how does this apply to 84? Let's see how many steps from 1004 down to 84: 1004 -84 =920, divided by 5 is 184 steps. So starting at 1004 (step 0), then 999 (step 1), 994 (step 2), ..., 84 (step 184). Wait, no: each step subtracts 5, so from 1004 to 999 is one step, to 994 is two steps, etc. So total steps from 1004 to 84 is (1004-84)/5 =920/5=184 steps. So step 0:1004, step1:999, step2:994,..., step184:84.\n\nNow, the values start at step0:1001, step1:998, step2:997, step3:998, step4:997, etc. So the pattern is that for even-numbered steps (0,2,4,...), the value is 1001, 997, 997,...? Wait, no. Let's list the first few steps:\n\nstep0:1004 \u21921001\n\nstep1:999 \u2192998\n\nstep2:994 \u2192997\n\nstep3:989 \u2192998\n\nstep4:984 \u2192997\n\nstep5:979 \u2192998\n\n...\n\nSo the pattern is that for steps 0:1001, then starting from step1, it's 998,997,998",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about a function f(x) = a x\u2074 - b x\u00b2 + x + 5. We know that f(-3) = 2, and we need to show that f(3) = 8. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how to connect f(-3) and f(3). The function has terms with even powers of x and some odd ones. Let me think: x\u2074 and x\u00b2 are even functions, so when you plug in -x, those terms stay the same. But the x term is an odd function, so plugging in -x would change its sign. The constant term, 5, remains the same regardless of x.\n\nSo maybe if I compute f(3) and f(-3), there's a relationship between them. Let's write out both:\n\nf(3) = a*(3)^4 - b*(3)^2 + 3 + 5 = 81a - 9b + 3 + 5 = 81a - 9b + 8.\n\nf(-3) = a*(-3)^4 - b*(-3)^2 + (-3) + 5 = 81a - 9b -3 +5 = 81a -9b +2.\n\nWait, the problem states that f(-3) = 2. So according to the calculation above, 81a -9b +2 = 2. Let me check that again. Yes, because (-3)^4 is 81, (-3)^2 is 9, so the a and b terms are the same as in f(3). Then the linear term is -3, and the constant is 5. So 81a -9b -3 +5 = 81a -9b +2. And that's equal to 2. So 81a -9b +2 = 2. Subtracting 2 from both sides gives 81a -9b = 0. So 81a = 9b, which simplifies to 9a = b. So b is 9 times a.\n\nNow, let's go back to f(3). We had f(3) = 81a -9b +8. But since b =9a, substitute that in: 81a -9*(9a) +8 = 81a -81a +8 = 0 +8 =8. So f(3) is 8. That's exactly what we needed to show.\n\nWait, but let me make sure there's no mistake here. The key idea is that the even-powered terms (x\u2074, x\u00b2) are the same for x and -x, so when you compute f(3) and f(-3), those terms contribute the same. The odd-powered term (x) changes sign. The constants are the same. So the difference between f(3) and f(-3) comes from the linear term and the sign change. Since f(-3) is given, we can solve for the combination of a and b, then plug into f(3). Since the a and b terms cancel out when substituting, we end up with a numerical value. That makes sense. So the answer is 8.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nLet's analyze the function \\( f(x) = ax^4 - bx^2 + x + 5 \\). We know \\( f(-3) = 2 \\), and we want to find \\( f(3) \\).\n\nFirst, observe that the terms \\( ax^4 \\) and \\( -bx^2 \\) involve even powers of \\( x \\), so substituting \\( x = 3 \\) or \\( x = -3 \\) into these terms will produce the same result. For example:\n- \\( (-3)^4 = 81 = 3^4 \\),\n- \\( (-3)^2 = 9 = 3^2 \\).\n\nThe linear term \\( x \\), however, is an odd function. Substituting \\( x = -3 \\) gives \\( -3 \\), while \\( x = 3 \\) gives \\( 3 \\). The constant term \\( +5 \\) remains unchanged.\n\nLet's compute \\( f(-3) \\):\n\\[\nf(-3) = a(-3)^4 - b(-3)^2 + (-3) + 5 = 81a - 9b - 3 + 5 = 81a - 9b + 2.\n\\]\nWe are told \\( f(-3) = 2 \\), so:\n\\[\n81a - 9b + 2 = 2 \\implies 81a - 9b = 0 \\implies 9a = b.\n\\]\nThis simplifies \\( b \\) in terms of \\( a \\).\n\nNow compute \\( f(3) \\):\n\\[\nf(3) = a(3)^4 - b(3)^2 + 3 + 5 = 81a - 9b + 3 + 5.\n\\]\nSubstitute \\( b = 9a \\):\n\\[\nf(3) = 81a - 9(9a) + 8 = 81a - 81a + 8 = 8.\n\\]\nThus, \\( f(3) = 8 \\), as required. The key insight is that the even-powered terms cancel out due to the relationship \\( b = 9a \\), leaving only the constant and linear terms to determine the final value.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unsolved goals\na b : \u211d\nf : \u211d \u2192 \u211d\nh\u2080 : \u2200 (x : \u211d), f x = a * x ^ 4 - b * x ^ 2 + x + 5\nh\u2082 : f (-3) = 2\nh\u2083 : 81 * a - 9 * b + 2 = 2\nh\u2084 : 81 * a - 9 * b = 0\nh\u2085 : 9 * a = b\n\u22a2 a * 81 - b * 9 + 3 + 5 = 81 * a - 9 * b + 8\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  9 * a\na b : \u211d\nf : \u211d \u2192 \u211d\nh\u2080 : \u2200 (x : \u211d), f x = a * x ^ 4 - b * x ^ 2 + x + 5\nh\u2082 : f (-3) = 2\nh\u2083 : 81 * a - 9 * b + 2 = 2\nh\u2084 : 81 * a - 9 * b = 0\nh\u2085 : 9 * a = b\nh\u2086 : f 3 = 81 * a - 9 * b + 8\n\u22a2 f 3 = 8\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unexpected identifier; expected command\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unsolved goals\na b : \u211d\nf : \u211d \u2192 \u211d\nh\u2080 : \u2200 (x : \u211d), f x = a * x ^ 4 - b * x ^ 2 + x + 5\nh\u2082 : f (-3) = 2\nh\u2083 : 81 * a - 9 * b + 2 = 2\nh\u2084 : 81 * a - 9 * b = 0\nh\u2085 : 9 * a = b\n\u22a2 a * 81 - b * 9 + 3 + 5 = 81 * a - 9 * b + 8\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  9 * a\na b : \u211d\nf : \u211d \u2192 \u211d\nh\u2080 : \u2200 (x : \u211d), f x = a * x ^ 4 - b * x ^ 2 + x + 5\nh\u2082 : f (-3) = 2\nh\u2083 : 81 * a - 9 * b + 2 = 2\nh\u2084 : 81 * a - 9 * b = 0\nh\u2085 : 9 * a = b\nh\u2086 : f 3 = 81 * a - 9 * b + 8\n\u22a2 f 3 = 8\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking for the product of the real roots of the equation x\u00b2 + 18x + 30 = 2\u221a(x\u00b2 + 18x + 45). And we need to show that this product is 20. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the equation looks a bit complicated because of the square root on the right side. Maybe I can simplify it by substituting a variable for the expression inside the square root. Let me let y = x\u00b2 + 18x + 45. Then, the equation becomes y - 15 = 2\u221ay. Wait, because x\u00b2 + 18x + 30 is equal to (x\u00b2 + 18x + 45) - 15, which is y - 15. So substituting that in, the equation is y - 15 = 2\u221ay.\n\nThat seems easier to handle. Let me rearrange this equation to eliminate the square root. If I move the 2\u221ay to the left side, I get y - 15 - 2\u221ay = 0. But maybe a better approach is to isolate the square root first. Let's add 15 to both sides and subtract y: -2\u221ay = -y + 15. Then multiply both sides by -1: 2\u221ay = y - 15. Now, square both sides to get rid of the square root. That would give (2\u221ay)\u00b2 = (y - 15)\u00b2, which simplifies to 4y = y\u00b2 - 30y + 225. Let's bring all terms to one side: y\u00b2 - 34y + 225 = 0. Now, solve this quadratic equation for y.\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, y = [34 \u00b1 \u221a(34\u00b2 - 4*1*225)] / 2. Calculating the discriminant: 34\u00b2 is 1156, and 4*1*225 is 900. So the discriminant is 1156 - 900 = 256. The square root of 256 is 16. Therefore, y = [34 \u00b1 16]/2. That gives two solutions: (34 + 16)/2 = 50/2 = 25, and (34 - 16)/2 = 18/2 = 9. So y can be 25 or 9.\n\nBut wait, we squared the equation earlier, which can introduce extraneous solutions. So we need to check these solutions in the original equation. Let's check y = 25 first. Substitute back into 2\u221ay = y - 15: 2*5 = 25 - 15 \u2192 10 = 10. That works. Now y = 9: 2*3 = 9 - 15 \u2192 6 = -6. That's not true. So y = 9 is an extraneous solution and we discard it. Therefore, the only valid solution is y = 25.\n\nNow, recall that y = x\u00b2 + 18x + 45. So substituting back, we have x\u00b2 + 18x + 45 = 25. Subtract 25 from both sides: x\u00b2 + 18x + 20 = 0. Now, this is a quadratic equation in x. The product of the roots of a quadratic equation ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0 is c/a. Here, a = 1 and c = 20, so the product is 20/1 = 20. Therefore, the product of the real roots is 20.\n\nBut wait, we need to make sure that both roots of this quadratic are real. Let's check the discriminant of x\u00b2 + 18x + 20 = 0. The discriminant is 18\u00b2 - 4*1*20 = 324 - 80 = 244, which is positive. So there are two distinct real roots, and their product is indeed 20. Hence, the answer is 20.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo find the product of the real roots of the equation \\( x^2 + 18x + 30 = 2 \\sqrt{x^2 + 18x + 45} \\), we start by simplifying the equation. Let \\( y = x^2 + 18x + 45 \\). Substituting this into the original equation gives:\n\n\\[\ny - 15 = 2 \\sqrt{y}.\n\\]\n\nRearranging and squaring both sides to eliminate the square root:\n\n\\[\n2 \\sqrt{y} = y - 15 \\implies 4y = y^2 - 30y + 225 \\implies y^2 - 34y + 225 = 0.\n\\]\n\nSolving this quadratic equation for \\( y \\), we find:\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{34 \\pm \\sqrt{34^2 - 4 \\cdot 225}}{2} = \\frac{34 \\pm 16}{2} \\implies y = 25 \\text{ or } y = 9.\n\\]\n\nChecking for extraneous solutions:\n- For \\( y = 25 \\): \\( 2 \\sqrt{25} = 10 = 25 - 15 \\), which is valid.\n- For \\( y = 9 \\): \\( 2 \\sqrt{9} = 6 \\neq 9 - 15 = -6 \\), so \\( y = 9 \\) is discarded.\n\nSubstituting \\( y = 25 \\) back into \\( x^2 + 18x + 45 = 25 \\), we get:\n\n\\[\nx^2 + 18x + 20 = 0.\n\\]\n\nThe product of the roots of this quadratic equation is \\( \\frac{c}{a} = \\frac{20}{1} = 20 \\). The discriminant \\( 18^2 - 4 \\cdot 20 = 244 \\) confirms both roots are real.

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to show that for any positive integer n, the remainder when 3^{2^n} - 1 is divided by 2^{n+3} is congruent to 2^{n+2} modulo 2^{n+3}. Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with exponents modulo powers of 2, there's some pattern or theorem that might help. Maybe something related to lifting the exponent lemma or properties of exponents in modular arithmetic. Let me think. For example, I know that 3 is congruent to -1 modulo 4, but here we're dealing with higher powers of 2. \n\nLet's start with small values of n to see if there's a pattern. Let's try n=1. Then the statement becomes 3^{2^1} - 1 = 3^2 -1 = 9 -1 =8. Now, 2^{1+3}=16. So 8 mod 16 is 8, and 2^{1+2}=8. So 8 \u22618 mod16. That works.\n\nFor n=2: 3^{4} -1=81-1=80. 2^{2+3}=32. Wait, 80 mod32 is 16, and 2^{2+2}=16. So 16\u226116 mod32. That also works.\n\nn=3: 3^{8}-1=6561-1=6560. 2^{3+3}=64. 6560 mod64. Let's compute 64*102=6528, so 6560-6528=32. But 2^{3+2}=32. So 32\u226132 mod64. Correct again.\n\nSo the pattern holds for these small n. Now, how to generalize this?\n\nI recall that for 3 modulo 2^k, there's a certain behavior. Let's see. Maybe using induction. Suppose that for some k \u22651, 3^{2^{k}} \u22611 + 2^{k+2} mod2^{k+3}. Then, we need to show that 3^{2^{k+1}} \u22611 +2^{k+3} mod2^{k+4}.\n\nWait, but the original problem is about 3^{2^n} -1 \u22612^{n+2} mod2^{n+3}. So maybe induction is the way to go here.\n\nLet's try induction. Base case n=1: as checked, works.\n\nAssume for n=k, 3^{2^k} \u22611 +2^{k+2} mod2^{k+3}. Then, for n=k+1, we need to compute 3^{2^{k+1}} = (3^{2^k})^2. Let's square the induction hypothesis.\n\nSo (1 +2^{k+2} + m*2^{k+3})^2, where m is some integer. Expanding this, we get 1 + 2*2^{k+2} + (2^{k+2})^2 + 2*m*2^{k+3} + ... But modulo 2^{k+4}, higher terms may vanish.\n\nLet's compute modulo 2^{k+4}. The square of (1 + a) where a=2^{k+2} mod2^{k+4} is 1 + 2a + a\u00b2. Here, a=2^{k+2}, so 2a=2^{k+3}, and a\u00b2=2^{2k+4}. Since k is a positive integer, 2k+4 \u2265k+4 when k\u22651. For example, if k=1, 2k+4=6 \u22655=1+4. So a\u00b2 is divisible by 2^{k+4}, hence a\u00b2\u22610 mod2^{k+4}. Therefore, the square becomes 1 +2^{k+3} mod2^{k+4}. Therefore, 3^{2^{k+1}} \u22611 +2^{k+3} mod2^{k+4}, which is exactly the statement for n=k+1. Hence, by induction, the result holds.\n\nWait, but the original problem states that 3^{2^n} -1 \u22612^{n+2} mod2^{n+3}. But according to the induction step, we have 3^{2^n} \u22611 +2^{n+2} mod2^{n+3}? Wait, no. Wait, the induction step shows that if 3^{2^k} \u22611 +2^{k+2} mod2^{k+3}, then 3^{2^{k+1}}}\u22611 +2^{k+3} mod2^{k+4}. So the congruence for n=k is modulo 2^{k+3}, and for n=k+1, modulo 2^{(k+1)+3}=2^{k+4}. So the induction step works. Therefore, the general result is that 3^{2^n} \u22611 +2^{n+2} mod2^{n+3}, which implies 3^{2^n} -1 \u22612^{n+2} mod2^{n+3}, which is exactly what we need to prove.\n\nTherefore, the proof by induction works. The key idea is squaring the induction hypothesis and expanding, then simplifying modulo the higher power of 2. The cross term gives the next term in the sequence, and the square term becomes negligible modulo the higher power.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the fact that 3 is congruent to -1 modulo 4, but that might not directly help here. Another approach could be using the binomial theorem on 3=2+1, but that might complicate things. The induction approach seems straightforward once the pattern is observed through examples.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo show that for any positive integer \\( n \\), the expression \\( 3^{2^n} - 1 \\) leaves a remainder of \\( 2^{n+2} \\) when divided by \\( 2^{n+3} \\), we use mathematical induction. This approach leverages the pattern observed in small cases and generalizes it by exploiting properties of exponents modulo powers of 2.\n\n**Base Case (\\( n = 1 \\)):**  \nCompute \\( 3^{2^1} - 1 = 3^2 - 1 = 9 - 1 = 8 \\).  \nHere, \\( 2^{1+3} = 16 \\), and \\( 8 \\mod 16 = 8 \\).  \nThe claim is \\( 8 \\equiv 2^{1+2} = 8 \\mod 16 \\), which holds true.\n\n**Inductive Step:**  \nAssume the statement holds for \\( n = k \\), i.e.,  \n\\[\n3^{2^k} \\equiv 1 + 2^{k+2} \\mod 2^{k+3}.\n\\]  \nWe need to prove it for \\( n = k + 1 \\).  \n\n**Compute \\( 3^{2^{k+1}} \\):**  \nObserve that \\( 3^{2^{k+1}} = \\left(3^{2^k}\\right)^2 \\).  \nUsing the inductive hypothesis:  \n\\[\n\\left(1 + 2^{k+2}\\right)^2 = 1 + 2 \\cdot 2^{k+2} + \\left(2^{k+2}\\right)^2.\n\\]  \nSimplify modulo \\( 2^{k+4} \\):  \n1. The term \\( 2 \\cdot 2^{k+2} = 2^{k+3} \\).  \n2. The term \\( \\left(2^{k+2}\\right)^2 = 2^{2k+4} \\). Since \\( 2k + 4 \\geq k + 4 \\) for \\( k \\geq 1 \\), this term is divisible by \\( 2^{k+4} \\), so it vanishes modulo \\( 2^{k+4} \\).  \n\nThus,  \n\\[\n\\left(1 + 2^{k+2}\\right)^2 \\equiv 1 + 2^{k+3} \\mod 2^{k+4}.\n\\]  \nThis implies:  \n\\[\n3^{2^{k+1}} \\equiv 1 + 2^{k+3} \\mod 2^{k+4}.\n\\]  \nSubtracting 1 from both sides:  \n\\[\n3^{2^{k+1}} - 1 \\equiv 2^{k+3} \\mod 2^{k+4}.\n\\]  \nThis matches the claim for \\( n = k + 1 \\), completing the inductive step.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nBy induction, the congruence \\( 3^{2^n} - 1 \\equiv 2^{n+2} \\mod 2^{n+3} \\) holds for all positive integers \\( n \\). The key insight is that squaring the inductive hypothesis amplifies the exponent of 2 in the remainder, while higher-order terms vanish modulo the increasing power of 2.\nPrevious attempt failed with: omega could not prove the goal:\na possible counterexample may satisfy the constraints\n  b \u2265 0\n  a \u2265 0\n  16*a - b \u2265 1\nwhere\n a := \u21912 ^ n\n b := \u2191(3 ^ (2 ^ n * 2 * 2) - 1) % \u2191(2 ^ n * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2)\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  ?n ^ ?m.succ\ncase succ.succ\nn : \u2115\nih : (3 ^ (2 ^ n * 2) - 1) % (2 ^ n * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2) = 2 ^ n * 2 * 2 * 2\nh\u2080 : True\n\u22a2 (3 ^ (2 ^ n * 2 * 2) - 1) % (2 ^ n * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2) = 2 ^ n * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  ?a * ?b % ?n\ncase succ.succ\nn : \u2115\nih : 0 < n + 1 \u2192 (3 ^ 2 ^ (n + 1) - 1) % 2 ^ (n + 1 + 3) = 2 ^ (n + 1 + 2)\nh\u2080 : 0 < n + 1 + 1\n\u22a2 (3 ^ (2 * (2 ^ n * 2)) - 1) % 2 ^ (n + 1 + 1 + 3) = 2 ^ (n + 1 + 1 + 2)\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking to convert the base three number 1222\u2083 to base ten and show that it equals 53. Alright, first, I need to remember how to convert numbers from base 3 to base 10. \n\nSo, in base 3, each digit represents a power of 3, starting from the rightmost digit as 3\u2070, then 3\u00b9, 3\u00b2, and so on. The number given is 1222\u2083. Let's break down each digit's position. The rightmost digit is the units place (3\u2070), then moving left, they are 3\u00b9, 3\u00b2, 3\u00b3, etc.\n\nLet me write out the digits of 1222\u2083. From right to left, the digits are 2, 2, 2, and 1. Wait, no, actually, in the number 1222\u2083, the digits from left to right are 1, 2, 2, 2. So the leftmost digit is the highest power. Let me confirm the positions. The rightmost digit is the 0th position, so for a 4-digit number in base 3, the positions are 3\u00b3, 3\u00b2, 3\u00b9, 3\u2070. Wait, no, the leftmost digit is the highest power. So for 1222\u2083, which has four digits, the leftmost digit is 3\u00b3, then next is 3\u00b2, then 3\u00b9, then 3\u2070. Let me check that again. For example, the number 1222 in base 3 would be calculated as:\n\n1 * 3\u00b3 + 2 * 3\u00b2 + 2 * 3\u00b9 + 2 * 3\u2070.\n\nYes, that's correct. Each digit is multiplied by 3 raised to the power of its position, starting from 0 on the right. So let's compute each term:\n\nFirst term: 1 * 3\u00b3 = 1 * 27 = 27.\n\nSecond term: 2 * 3\u00b2 = 2 * 9 = 18.\n\nThird term: 2 * 3\u00b9 = 2 * 3 = 6.\n\nFourth term: 2 * 3\u2070 = 2 * 1 = 2.\n\nNow, add all these together: 27 + 18 + 6 + 2. Let's add them step by step. 27 + 18 is 45. Then 45 + 6 is 51. Then 51 + 2 is 53. So the total is 53. Therefore, 1222 in base 3 is 53 in base 10. \n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to be sure. Let's verify each part again. 3\u00b3 is 27, correct. 3\u00b2 is 9, so 2*9=18. 3\u00b9 is 3, so 2*3=6. 3\u2070 is 1, so 2*1=2. Adding them up: 27 + 18 is indeed 45. 45 + 6 is 51. 51 + 2 is 53. Yep, that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write the number as 1*3\u00b3 + 2*3\u00b2 + 2*3 + 2. Let me compute each term again. 3\u00b3 is 27, so 1*27=27. 3\u00b2 is 9, 2*9=18. 3^1 is 3, 2*3=6. 3^0 is 1, 2*1=2. Summing: 27+18=45, 45+6=51, 51+2=53. Same result. \n\nSo the conversion seems correct. Therefore, the father's age is 53 in base ten. The problem asks to show that it's 53, which matches our calculation. \n\nI should also consider if there's any alternative way someone might approach this, perhaps by expanding the number step by step. Let's see. Starting from the rightmost digit: the digits are 1 (thousands place in base 3), 2 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 2 (units). Wait, no, in base 3, each position is a power of 3. So the rightmost digit is 3^0 (units), then 3^1 (threes), 3^2 (nines), 3^3 (twenty-sevens). So the leftmost digit here is 3^3. So the number is 1 in the 3^3 place, 2 in 3^2, 2 in 3^1, and 2 in 3^0. That's exactly what I did before. \n\nAnother way to think about it: 1222 in base 3. Let's write it as (1)(2)(2)(2). So expanding each digit's value:\n\n1 * 3^3 = 27\n\n2 * 3^2 = 18\n\n2 * 3^1 = 6\n\n2 * 3^0 = 2\n\nAdding those gives 27 + 18 + 6 + 2 = 53. Yep, same result. \n\nI think that's solid. There's no mistake here. So the answer is indeed 53. The problem statement just wants confirmation, and the steps all check out. Therefore, the proof is straightforward once you break down each digit's positional value and sum them up.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo convert the base three number \\(1222_3\\) to base ten, we need to understand how each digit contributes to the total value based on its position. In base 3, the rightmost digit represents \\(3^0\\), the next \\(3^1\\), then \\(3^2\\), and so on. Breaking down \\(1222_3\\):\n\n- The leftmost digit is \\(1\\) in the \\(3^3\\) position: \\(1 \\times 3^3 = 1 \\times 27 = 27\\).\n- The next digit is \\(2\\) in the \\(3^2\\) position: \\(2 \\times 9 = 18\\).\n- The third digit is \\(2\\) in the \\(3^1\\) position: \\(2 \\times 3 = 6\\).\n- The rightmost digit is \\(2\\) in the \\(3^0\\) position: \\(2 \\times 1 = 2\\).\n\nAdding these values together:  \n\\(27 + 18 + 6 + 2 = 53\\).  \n\nThus, \\(1222_3\\) in base three is equivalent to \\(53\\) in base ten.

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. We have four positive integers a, b, c, d. Their product is 8! which is 40320. Also, there are three equations given:\n\nab + a + b = 524  \nbc + b + c = 146  \ncd + c + d = 104  \n\nWe need to find a - d and show it's 10. The answer choices suggest it's one of the options, so maybe 10 is the correct one. Let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, looking at the equations, they all have a similar structure: something like xy + x + y. That reminds me of the formula for combining two numbers in a way that can be factored. Let me think. If we add 1 to both sides, maybe we can factor it. For example, take the first equation:\n\nab + a + b + 1 = 524 + 1 = 525  \nThen, (a + 1)(b + 1) = 525. Oh, right! Because (x+1)(y+1) = xy + x + y +1. So this factorization might be useful for all three equations.\n\nLet's apply this to each equation:\n\n1. ab + a + b = 524 \u2192 (a+1)(b+1) = 525  \n2. bc + b + c = 146 \u2192 (b+1)(c+1) = 147  \n3. cd + c + d = 104 \u2192 (c+1)(d+1) = 105  \n\nNow, this seems promising. Let's denote each product as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s set:\n- X = a + 1\n- Y = b + 1\n- Z = c + 1\n- W = d + 1\n\nThen the equations become:\n1. X * Y = 525  \n2. Y * Z = 147  \n3. Z * W = 105  \n\nSo we have a chain of products here. Also, the product of a, b, c, d is 8! = 40320. Let's express a, b, c, d in terms of X, Y, Z, W:\n\na = X - 1  \nb = Y - 1  \nc = Z - 1  \nd = W - 1  \n\nSo the product (X-1)(Y-1)(Z-1)(W-1) = 40320.\n\nBut maybe we can find X, Y, Z, W first. Let's see. From the equations:\n\nFrom 1: X = 525 / Y  \nFrom 2: Z = 147 / Y  \nFrom 3: W = 105 / Z = 105 / (147 / Y) = 105Y / 147 = (105/147)Y = (5/7)Y. Wait, but Y must be a divisor of 525, 147, and 105Y must be divisible by 147? Hmm, maybe better to find Y first.\n\nLooking at the equations, Y is a common factor in both 525 and 147. So Y must be a common divisor of 525 and 147. Let's find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 525 and 147.\n\nPrime factors of 525: 5^2 * 3 * 7  \nPrime factors of 147: 3 * 7^2  \nSo GCD is 3 * 7 = 21. Therefore, possible values for Y are the divisors of 21, i.e., 1, 3, 7, 21. But since Y = b + 1 and b is a positive integer, Y must be at least 2. So possible Y values are 3, 7, 21.\n\nWait, but let's check. If Y is 3, then from equation 1: X = 525 / 3 = 175. Then from equation 2: Z = 147 / 3 = 49. Then from equation 3: W = 105 / 49. But 105 divided by 49 is not an integer. 49*2=98, 105-98=7, so 105/49=2.142..., which is not an integer. So W would not be an integer, which is invalid because W = d + 1 must be an integer. Therefore, Y=3 is invalid.\n\nNext, Y=7. Then X=525/7=75. Z=147/7=21. Then W=105/21=5. So W=5. Then check if these values make sense. Then a = X-1=74, b=Y-1=6, c=Z-1=20, d=W-1=4. Let's check the product: 74*6*20*4. Let's compute that: 74*6=444, 20*4=80, then 444*80=35,520. But 8! is 40320, so this product is 35,520 which is less than 40320. So this can't be right. Therefore, Y=7 is invalid.\n\nNext, Y=21. Then X=525/21=25. Z=147/21=7. Then W=105/7=15. So W=15. Then a=24, b=20, c=6, d=14. Check the product: 24*20*6*14. Let's compute: 24*20=480, 6*14=84, 480*84=40,320. Which is exactly 8! So this works. Therefore, the values are a=24, b=20, c=6, d=14. Then a - d =24 -14=10. So the answer is 10, option D.\n\nWait, but let's confirm all the equations. Let's check each equation:\n\nFirst equation: ab +a +b. a=24, b=20. 24*20 +24 +20 = 480 +44=524. Correct.\n\nSecond equation: bc +b +c. b=20, c=6. 20*6 +20 +6=120+26=146. Correct.\n\nThird equation: cd +c +d. c=6, d=14. 6*14 +6 +14=84+20=104. Correct.\n\nProduct: 24*20*6*14=24*20=480, 6*14=84, 480*84=40320=8!. Correct.\n\nSo all conditions are satisfied. Therefore, a-d=24-14=10. So the answer is D)10.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nLet's start by analyzing the given equations. Each equation has the form \\( xy + x + y \\), which can be cleverly rewritten by adding 1 to both sides. For example, the first equation becomes:\n\\[\nab + a + b + 1 = 525 \\implies (a+1)(b+1) = 525.\n\\]\nSimilarly, applying this to all three equations:\n1. \\((a+1)(b+1) = 525\\),\n2. \\((b+1)(c+1) = 147\\),\n3. \\((c+1)(d+1) = 105\\).\n\nLet \\( X = a+1 \\), \\( Y = b+1 \\), \\( Z = c+1 \\), and \\( W = d+1 \\). The equations simplify to:\n\\[\nX \\cdot Y = 525, \\quad Y \\cdot Z = 147, \\quad Z \\cdot W = 105.\n\\]\nThese relationships form a chain of products. To solve for \\( Y \\), observe that \\( Y \\) must divide both \\( 525 \\) and \\( 147 \\). The greatest common divisor (GCD) of \\( 525 \\) and \\( 147 \\) is \\( 21 \\), so possible values for \\( Y \\) are \\( 3, 7, 21 \\).\n\n- **Testing \\( Y = 21 \\):**  \n  - \\( X = 525 / 21 = 25 \\implies a = 24 \\),  \n  - \\( Z = 147 / 21 = 7 \\implies c = 6 \\),  \n  - \\( W = 105 / 7 = 15 \\implies d = 14 \\).  \n\n  Verify the product \\( a \\cdot b \\cdot c \\cdot d = 24 \\cdot 20 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 14 = 40320 = 8! \\), which matches.  \n  Check all equations:\n  - \\( ab + a + b = 24 \\cdot 20 + 24 + 20 = 524 \\),  \n  - \\( bc + b + c = 20 \\cdot 6 + 20 + 6 = 146 \\),  \n  - \\( cd + c + d = 6 \\cdot 14 + 6 + 14 = 104 \\).  \n\nAll conditions are satisfied. Thus, \\( a - d = 24 - 14 = 10 \\).

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the remainder when the sum of numbers from 1 to 12 is divided by 4. The problem says the answer should be 2, but I need to show why that's the case. Hmm, how do I approach this?\n\nFirst, maybe I should just add all the numbers from 1 to 12 and then divide by 4 to find the remainder. But adding all those numbers might take time. Wait, there's a formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers: n(n+1)/2. Let me check that. For n=12, the sum would be 12*13/2 = 78. Then 78 divided by 4 is 19 with a remainder of 2, since 19*4=76 and 78-76=2. So the remainder is 2. That seems straightforward, but maybe there's another way using modulo properties to break it down without calculating the entire sum.\n\nAlternatively, I could compute each term modulo 4 first and then add those remainders together, taking modulo 4 at each step to keep numbers small. Let's try that. Let's list the numbers from 1 to 12 and their remainders modulo 4:\n\n1 mod 4 = 1\n\n2 mod 4 = 2\n\n3 mod 4 = 3\n\n4 mod 4 = 0\n\n5 mod 4 = 1 (since 5-4=1)\n\n6 mod 4 = 2\n\n7 mod 4 = 3\n\n8 mod 4 = 0\n\n9 mod 4 = 1\n\n10 mod 4 = 2\n\n11 mod 4 = 3\n\n12 mod 4 = 0\n\nNow, adding these remainders: 1+2+3+0+1+2+3+0+1+2+3+0. Let's add them step by step:\n\n1+2=3\n\n3+3=6\n\n6+0=6\n\n6+1=7\n\n7+2=9\n\n9+3=12\n\n12+0=12\n\n12+1=13\n\n13+2=15\n\n15+3=18\n\n18+0=18\n\nNow, 18 mod 4 is 18 - 4*4 = 18 -16 = 2. So the remainder is 2. That matches the first method. But maybe there's a pattern here. Looking at the remainders, every four numbers, the remainders cycle through 1, 2, 3, 0. So from 1 to 4: 1,2,3,0; 5 to 8:1,2,3,0; 9 to 12:1,2,3,0. Each group of four adds up to 1+2+3+0=6. There are three such groups (since 12/4=3), so total sum of remainders is 3*6=18. Then 18 mod 4 is 2. That's a quicker way. So both methods confirm the remainder is 2.\n\nBut wait, the problem mentions \"modulo addition is well-defined\" in the context. Maybe I should relate this to that concept. Modulo addition being well-defined means that if two numbers are congruent modulo 4, their sums are also congruent modulo 4. So adding each term modulo 4 first and then summing gives the same result as summing all terms and then taking modulo 4. That's exactly what I did here. So by breaking down each term's remainder and adding them, I used the property that modulo addition is well-defined to simplify the calculation. That makes sense. So the key idea is leveraging the properties of modular arithmetic to simplify the computation instead of dealing with large numbers. This approach is efficient and avoids potential errors from handling big sums directly.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo determine the remainder when the sum \\(1 + 2 + 3 + \\dots + 12\\) is divided by \\(4\\), we can leverage the properties of modular arithmetic. Instead of calculating the total sum first, we compute the remainder of each term modulo \\(4\\) and then sum these remainders, simplifying at each step.\n\n1. **Compute individual remainders modulo \\(4\\):**\n   - \\(1 \\mod 4 = 1\\)\n   - \\(2 \\mod 4 = 2\\)\n   - \\(3 \\mod 4 = 3\\)\n   - \\(4 \\mod 4 = 0\\)\n   - \\(5 \\mod 4 = 1\\) (since \\(5 - 4 = 1\\))\n   - \\(6 \\mod 4 = 2\\)\n   - \\(7 \\mod 4 = 3\\)\n   - \\(8 \\mod 4 = 0\\)\n   - \\(9 \\mod 4 = 1\\)\n   - \\(10 \\mod 4 = 2\\)\n   - \\(11 \\mod 4 = 3\\)\n   - \\(12 \\mod 4 = 0\\)\n\n2. **Sum the remainders:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 2 + 3 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 0\n   \\]\n   Grouping terms for clarity:\n   \\[\n   (1 + 2 + 3 + 0) + (1 + 2 + 3 + 0) + (1 + 2 + 3 + 0) = 6 + 6 + 6 = 18\n   \\]\n\n3. **Compute the final remainder:**\n   \\[\n   18 \\mod 4 = 2 \\quad (\\text{since } 18 - 4 \\times 4 = 18 - 16 = 2).\n   \\]\n\n**Conclusion:** The remainder when \\(1 + 2 + 3 + \\dots + 12\\) is divided by \\(4\\) is **2**.

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is to find the value of the expression (3x - 2)(4x + 1) - (3x - 2)4x + 1 when x=4. The answer choices are given, and we need to show that the correct answer is D) 11.\n\nFirst, I need to simplify the expression step by step. Let me look at the original expression: (3x - 2)(4x + 1) minus (3x - 2)4x plus 1. Hmm, maybe there's a common factor here that I can factor out to make it simpler. \n\nLooking at the first two terms, both have (3x - 2) multiplied by something. The first term is (3x - 2)(4x + 1), and the second term is -(3x - 2)(4x). So maybe I can factor out (3x - 2) from those two terms. Let's try that.\n\nSo, factoring out (3x - 2) from the first two terms: (3x - 2)[(4x + 1) - 4x] + 1. Let's simplify inside the brackets. (4x + 1) - 4x would just be 1, right? Because 4x cancels out. So then the expression becomes (3x - 2)(1) + 1. Which simplifies to 3x - 2 + 1. Then combine the constants: 3x - 1.\n\nWait, so after simplifying the entire expression, it's just 3x - 1. Then plug in x=4. So 3*4 is 12, minus 1 is 11. That gives the answer 11, which is option D. That makes sense.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the factoring. Let's expand the original expression without factoring first to confirm. \n\nFirst, expand (3x - 2)(4x + 1). Multiply 3x by 4x to get 12x\u00b2, 3x by 1 to get 3x, -2 by 4x to get -8x, and -2 by 1 to get -2. So combining those terms: 12x\u00b2 + 3x -8x -2 = 12x\u00b2 -5x -2.\n\nThen subtract (3x - 2)4x. Let's expand that: 3x*4x =12x\u00b2, -2*4x = -8x. So that term is 12x\u00b2 -8x. So subtracting that from the previous result: (12x\u00b2 -5x -2) - (12x\u00b2 -8x) = 12x\u00b2 -5x -2 -12x\u00b2 +8x. The 12x\u00b2 terms cancel out, leaving (-5x +8x) -2 = 3x -2. Then add the +1 at the end: 3x -2 +1 = 3x -1. So yes, that's the same as before. Then plugging x=4 gives 3*4 -1 =12 -1=11. So the answer is indeed D)11.\n\nAlternatively, maybe someone might try plugging x=4 directly into the original expression without simplifying. Let's see what happens then. Let's compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst, compute (3x -2) when x=4: 3*4=12, 12-2=10. Then (4x +1) when x=4: 4*4=16, 16+1=17. So the first term is 10*17=170.\n\nNext, compute (3x -2)4x when x=4: 10 (from 3x-2) multiplied by 4x=16 (since 4*4=16). So 10*16=160. Then subtract that from the first term: 170 -160=10. Then add 1: 10 +1=11. So again, we get 11. So both methods confirm the answer is D)11.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 11.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nLet's tackle the expression step by step. We need to evaluate \\((3x - 2)(4x + 1) - (3x - 2)4x + 1\\) at \\(x = 4\\).\n\n**Step 1: Factor out the common term**  \nNotice that \\((3x - 2)\\) appears in both the first and second terms. Factor it out:  \n\\[\n(3x - 2)\\big[(4x + 1) - 4x\\big] + 1.\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Simplify inside the brackets**  \nThe expression inside the brackets simplifies to:  \n\\[\n(4x + 1) - 4x = 1.\n\\]  \nSo the entire expression reduces to:  \n\\[\n(3x - 2)(1) + 1 = 3x - 2 + 1 = 3x - 1.\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Substitute \\(x = 4\\)**  \nPlugging in \\(x = 4\\):  \n\\[\n3(4) - 1 = 12 - 1 = 11.\n\\]\n\n**Verification (Alternative Approach):**  \nFor clarity, let's expand the original expression directly at \\(x = 4\\):  \n1.

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is to find the sum of all solutions to the equation |2 - x| = 3 and show that the sum is 4. Hmm. Alright, absolute value equations usually have two solutions because the expression inside can be either positive or negative. So, I remember that |A| = B means A = B or A = -B. Let me apply that here.\n\nSo, starting with |2 - x| = 3. This means that either 2 - x = 3 or 2 - x = -3. Let me solve each equation separately.\n\nFirst case: 2 - x = 3. Subtract 2 from both sides: -x = 1. Multiply both sides by -1: x = -1. So that's one solution, x = -1.\n\nSecond case: 2 - x = -3. Again, subtract 2 from both sides: -x = -5. Multiply by -1: x = 5. So the other solution is x = 5.\n\nNow, the solutions are x = -1 and x = 5. To find the sum, just add them together: -1 + 5 = 4. That's the answer. Wait, but let me double-check. Did I solve both equations correctly?\n\nFirst equation: 2 - x = 3. Solving for x: x = 2 - 3 = -1. Yep. Second equation: 2 - x = -3. So x = 2 + 3 = 5. Correct. Adding them gives 4. Seems straightforward. Maybe the problem is testing understanding that absolute value equations can have two solutions and their sum can be found by adding both roots. Alternatively, maybe there's a shortcut. For equations like |x - a| = b, the solutions are a + b and a - b, so their sum is 2a. Wait, in this case, the equation is |2 - x| = 3, which is the same as |x - 2| = 3. So the solutions would be 2 + 3 = 5 and 2 - 3 = -1. Sum is 5 + (-1) = 4. So that's another way to see it. The sum of solutions is 2 times the value inside the absolute value expression (since a + b + a - b = 2a). So here, a is 2, so 2*2=4. That's a quicker way. But since the problem asks to show the sum is 4, either method works. But since the user wants a detailed explanation, maybe I should explain both solving each case and then adding, and perhaps mention the shortcut if applicable. But maybe the first method is clearer for someone learning. Let me structure it step by step.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo solve the equation \\( |2 - x| = 3 \\), we start by recalling that the absolute value equation \\( |A| = B \\) implies two possibilities: \\( A = B \\) or \\( A = -B \\). Applying this to \\( |2 - x| = 3 \\), we split it into two separate linear equations:\n\n1. **First case:** \\( 2 - x = 3 \\)\\\n   Solving for \\( x \\):\\\n   Subtract 2 from both sides: \\( -x = 1 \\)\\\n   Multiply by \\(-1\\): \\( x = -1 \\).\n\n2. **Second case:** \\( 2 - x = -3 \\)\\\n   Solving for \\( x \\):\\\n   Subtract 2 from both sides: \\( -x = -5 \\)\\\n   Multiply by \\(-1\\): \\( x = 5 \\).\n\nThe solutions are \\( x = -1 \\) and \\( x = 5 \\). To find the sum of all solutions, we add them together:  \n\\[\n-1 + 5 = 4.\n\\]\n\n**Alternative Insight:** For equations of the form \\( |x - a| = b \\), the solutions are \\( x = a + b \\) and \\( x = a - b \\). Their sum is \\( (a + b) + (a - b) = 2a \\). Here, \\( |2 - x| = 3 \\) can be rewritten as \\( |x - 2| = 3 \\), so \\( a = 2 \\) and \\( b = 3 \\). The sum of solutions is \\( 2 \\times 2 = 4 \\), confirming the result. Either approach shows the sum of all solutions is **4**.\nPrevious attempt failed with: dependent elimination failed, failed to solve equation\n  { cauchy := \u21913 } = Real.sup (2 - x) (-(2 - x))\ntactic 'left' failed, left tactic works for inductive types with exactly 2 constructors\ncase a.mpr.inl\nS : Finset \u211d\nh\u2080 : \u2200 (x : \u211d), x \u2208 S \u2194 |2 - x| = 3\nx : \u211d\nh : x = -1\n\u22a2 |2 - x| = 3\ntactic 'right' failed, right tactic works for inductive types with exactly 2 constructors\ncase a.mpr.inr\nS : Finset \u211d\nh\u2080 : \u2200 (x : \u211d), x \u2208 S \u2194 |2 - x| = 3\nx : \u211d\nh : x = 5\n\u22a2 |2 - x| = 3\nsimp made no progress\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: expected token\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: typeclass instance problem is stuck, it is often due to metavariables\n  Insert \u2124 ?m.498\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about an arithmetic series. The sum of the first 5 terms is 70, and the sum of the first 10 terms is 210. We need to find the first term and show it's 42/5. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember that the sum of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula S_n = n/2 * [2a + (n-1)d], where a is the first term, d is the common difference, and n is the number of terms. Alternatively, another formula is S_n = n*(a1 + an)/2, where a1 is the first term and an is the nth term. Maybe using these formulas will help set up equations.\n\nGiven that the sum of the first 5 terms is 70, let's plug n=5 into the formula. So S_5 = 5/2 * [2a + 4d] = 70. Simplifying that, 5/2*(2a +4d) =70. Multiply both sides by 2/5 to get 2a +4d = 28. Then divide both sides by 2: a +2d =14. Let's call this equation (1).\n\nSimilarly, for the sum of the first 10 terms being 210, S_10 =10/2 * [2a +9d] =210. That simplifies to 5*(2a +9d)=210. Divide both sides by 5: 2a +9d =42. Let's call this equation (2).\n\nNow we have two equations:\n1) a +2d =14\n2) 2a +9d =42\n\nWe can solve this system of equations. Let's solve equation (1) for a: a =14 -2d. Then substitute this into equation (2). So 2*(14 -2d) +9d =42. Let's compute that: 28 -4d +9d =42. Combine like terms: 28 +5d =42. Subtract 28: 5d=14. So d=14/5=2.8.\n\nNow substitute d=14/5 back into equation (1): a +2*(14/5)=14. That's a +28/5=14. Convert 14 to 70/5, so a=70/5 -28/5=42/5. Which is 8.4. So the first term is 42/5. That matches what the problem asked to show. Let me check the calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with S_5: 5/2*(2a +4d)=70. If a=42/5 and d=14/5, then 2a=84/5, 4d=56/5. Adding them gives 140/5=28. Then 5/2*28=5*14=70. Correct. For S_10: 10/2*(2a +9d)=5*(84/5 + 126/5)=5*(210/5)=5*42=210. Yep, that works. So the answer is indeed 42/5.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo find the first term of the arithmetic series, we start with the standard formula for the sum of the first \\( n \\) terms of an arithmetic series:\n\\[\nS_n = \\frac{n}{2} \\left[2a + (n-1)d\\right],\n\\]\nwhere \\( a \\) is the first term and \\( d \\) is the common difference.\n\n**Step 1: Set up equations using the given sums.**  \nFor the first 5 terms (\\( n = 5 \\)) with sum \\( 70 \\):\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{2} \\left[2a + 4d\\right] = 70.\n\\]\nSimplify by multiplying both sides by \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\):\n\\[\n2a + 4d = 28 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad a + 2d = 14. \\quad \\text{(Equation 1)}\n\\]\n\nFor the first 10 terms (\\( n = 10 \\)) with sum \\( 210 \\):\n\\[\n\\frac{10}{2} \\left[2a + 9d\\right] = 210 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 5(2a + 9d) = 210.\n\\]\nDivide by 5:\n\\[\n2a + 9d = 42. \\quad \\text{(Equation 2)}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Solve the system of equations.**  \nFrom Equation 1, solve for \\( a \\):\n\\[\na = 14 - 2d.\n\\]\nSubstitute \\( a = 14 - 2d \\) into Equation 2:\n\\[\n2(14 - 2d) + 9d = 42 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 28 - 4d + 9d = 42.\n\\]\nCombine like terms:\n\\[\n28 + 5d = 42 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 5d = 14 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad d = \\frac{14}{5}.\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Find \\( a \\).**  \nSubstitute \\( d = \\frac{14}{5} \\) back into \\( a = 14 - 2d \\):\n\\[\na = 14 - 2\\left(\\frac{14}{5}\\right) = 14 - \\frac{28}{5} = \\frac{70}{5} - \\frac{28}{5} = \\frac{42}{5}.\n\\]\n\n**Verification:**  \n- For \\( n = 5 \\):  \n  \\( 2a + 4d = 2\\left(\\frac{42}{5}\\right) + 4\\left(\\frac{14}{5}\\right) = \\frac{84}{5} + \\frac{56}{5} = \\frac{140}{5} = 28 \\).  \n  Then \\( \\frac{5}{2} \\times 28 = 70 \\), which matches the given sum.  \n\n- For \\( n = 10 \\):  \n  \\( 2a + 9d = 2\\left(\\frac{42}{5}\\right) + 9\\left(\\frac{14}{5}\\right) = \\frac{84}{5} + \\frac{126}{5} = \\frac{210}{5} = 42 \\).  \n  Then \\( \\frac{10}{2} \\times 42 = 210 \\), which also matches the given sum.  \n\nThus, the first term of the series is indeed \\( \\frac{42}{5} \\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: linarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase h2.h\nk a d : \u211d\nh\u2080 : 5 * a + k * d = 70\nh\u2081 : 10 * a + k * d = 210\na\u271d : 42 / 5 < a\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: linarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase h2.h\nk a d : \u211d\nh\u2080 : 5 * a + k * d = 70\nh\u2081 : 10 * a + k * d = 210\na\u271d : 42 / 5 < a\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: linarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase h2.h\nk a d : \u211d\nh\u2080 : 5 * a + k * d = 70\nh\u2081 : 10 * a + k * d = 210\na\u271d : 42 / 5 < a\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the modulo 4 residue of the product 121 multiplied by 122 multiplied by 123, and show that it's equal to 2. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with modular arithmetic, especially with products, it's helpful to reduce each number modulo the base first before multiplying. Since we're working modulo 4, I can simplify each of these numbers by finding their remainder when divided by 4. That should make the multiplication easier and the numbers smaller, which is less error-prone.\n\nLet's start with 121. Dividing 121 by 4: 4 times 30 is 120, so 121 divided by 4 is 30 with a remainder of 1. So 121 \u2261 1 mod 4.\n\nNext, 122. 4 times 30 is 120 again, so 122 minus 120 is 2. Therefore, 122 \u2261 2 mod 4.\n\nThen, 123. 4 times 30 is 120, so 123 minus 120 is 3. So 123 \u2261 3 mod 4.\n\nNow, the original product 121\u00d7122\u00d7123 modulo 4 is equivalent to (1\u00d72\u00d73) mod 4. Let's compute that step by step. First, multiply 1 and 2: 1\u00d72 = 2. Then multiply that result by 3: 2\u00d73 = 6. Now, 6 mod 4 is 2 because 4 goes into 6 once with a remainder of 2. Therefore, the product modulo 4 is 2.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's verify each number's remainder again. \n\n121 divided by 4: 4\u00d730=120, remainder 1. Correct. \n\n122 divided by 4: 4\u00d730=120, remainder 2. Correct. \n\n123 divided by 4: 4\u00d730=120, remainder 3. Correct. \n\nMultiplying 1\u00d72\u00d73 gives 6. 6 divided by 4 is 1 with remainder 2. So yes, 6 mod 4 is 2. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this. For example, noticing that 121 is odd, 122 is even, and 123 is odd. But modulo 4, even numbers can be 0 or 2, and odd numbers can be 1 or 3. But in this case, we already broke them down into their specific residues. \n\nAnother check: Let's compute the product first and then take modulo 4. 121\u00d7122 is 14762, then multiply by 123: 14762\u00d7123. But that's a huge number. Instead of calculating the entire product, which is tedious, using modular arithmetic properties is smarter. Since (a \u00d7 b \u00d7 c) mod 4 = [(a mod 4) \u00d7 (b mod 4) \u00d7 (c mod 4)] mod 4, which is exactly what I did. So the approach is valid.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion that the residue is 2 is correct.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo find the modulo 4 residue of \\(121 \\cdot 122 \\cdot 123\\), we first reduce each factor modulo 4:\n\n1. **Simplify each number:**\n   - \\(121 \\div 4 = 30\\) with a remainder of \\(1\\), so \\(121 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}\\).\n   - \\(122 \\div 4 = 30\\) with a remainder of \\(2\\), so \\(122 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4}\\).\n   - \\(123 \\div 4 = 30\\) with a remainder of \\(3\\), so \\(123 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}\\).\n\n2. **Multiply the reduced values:**\n   Substitute the simplified residues into the product:\n   \\[\n   (1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3) \\pmod{4}.\n   \\]\n   Compute step-by-step:\n   - \\(1 \\cdot 2 = 2\\),\n   - \\(2 \\cdot 3 = 6\\),\n   - \\(6 \\pmod{4} = 2\\) (since \\(6 = 1 \\cdot 4 + 2\\)).\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   The product \\(121 \\cdot 122 \\cdot 123\\) leaves a remainder of \\(2\\) when divided by \\(4\\).

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The problem says that the first three terms of an arithmetic sequence are 2x - 3, 5x - 11, and 3x + 1. The nth term is 2009, and we need to find n. The answer choices are given, but we need to show that it's 502.\n\nFirst, I remember that in an arithmetic sequence, the difference between consecutive terms is constant. So, the difference between the second and first term should be the same as the difference between the third and second term. Let me write that down.\n\nThe first term is 2x - 3, the second is 5x - 11, and the third is 3x + 1. The common difference (d) can be found by subtracting the first term from the second, and the second term from the third. These two differences should be equal because it's an arithmetic sequence.\n\nSo, let's calculate the first difference: (5x - 11) - (2x - 3). Simplifying that, 5x - 11 - 2x + 3 = 3x - 8.\n\nNow the second difference: (3x + 1) - (5x - 11). That simplifies to 3x + 1 - 5x + 11 = -2x + 12.\n\nSince these differences are equal, set them equal to each other: 3x - 8 = -2x + 12. Solving for x, add 2x to both sides: 5x - 8 = 12. Then add 8 to both sides: 5x = 20. So x = 4.\n\nNow that we know x is 4, substitute back into the terms to find the actual terms of the sequence. \n\nFirst term: 2(4) - 3 = 8 - 3 = 5.\n\nSecond term: 5(4) - 11 = 20 - 11 = 9.\n\nThird term: 3(4) + 1 = 12 + 1 = 13.\n\nLet me check if these form an arithmetic sequence. The difference between the second and first term is 9 - 5 = 4. The difference between the third and second term is 13 - 9 = 4. Yep, common difference d = 4. Good.\n\nNow, the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is given by a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d. We know the nth term is 2009, so plug in the values:\n\n2009 = 5 + (n - 1)*4.\n\nSubtract 5 from both sides: 2004 = (n - 1)*4.\n\nDivide both sides by 4: 501 = n - 1.\n\nAdd 1 to both sides: n = 502.\n\nSo, the answer is 502, which is option B. Let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. The substitution for x=4 gives the terms 5, 9, 13, which have a common difference of 4. Then solving 5 + 4(n-1) = 2009 leads to n=502. Everything checks out.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo solve the problem, we start by recognizing that in an arithmetic sequence, the difference between consecutive terms is constant.

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking for f(f(1)) where f(x) is defined as 1 divided by (x + 2). I need to show that the result is 3/7.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what f(f(1)) means. That's applying the function f twice. So first compute f(1), then take that result and plug it back into f again. Let's break it down.\n\nStarting with the inner function: f(1). According to the definition of f, wherever there's an x, we substitute 1. So f(1) = 1 / (1 + 2). Wait, 1 + 2 is 3, so that simplifies to 1/3. So f(1) is 1/3. That seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the next step is to compute f of that result. So f(f(1)) is f(1/3). Again, substituting x with 1/3 in the function f. So f(1/3) = 1 / ( (1/3) + 2 ). Let me compute the denominator here. 1/3 plus 2. To add these, I can express 2 as 6/3, so 1/3 + 6/3 = 7/3. Therefore, the denominator becomes 7/3. So f(1/3) is 1 divided by (7/3), which is the same as multiplying by the reciprocal: 1 * (3/7) = 3/7. \n\nWait, let me check that again. If you have 1 divided by (7/3), that's equivalent to 1 multiplied by 3/7, which is indeed 3/7. So yes, that's correct. \n\nBut let me make sure there's no mistake in the substitution steps. When substituting x = 1/3 into f(x), the expression is 1/(x + 2). So x is 1/3, so x + 2 is 1/3 + 2. Converting 2 to thirds gives 6/3, so 1/3 + 6/3 = 7/3. Then 1 divided by 7/3 is 3/7. That checks out.\n\nSo putting it all together: f(1) = 1/3, then f(1/3) = 3/7. Therefore, f(f(1)) = 3/7. \n\nI should also consider if there are any restrictions or domain issues here. The function f(x) is defined as long as the denominator x + 2 is not zero. For x = 1, x + 2 = 3, which is fine. Then for x = 1/3, x + 2 = 7/3, which is also not zero. So both steps are valid, and there's no division by zero issue here. \n\nAnother way to look at it is to compose the functions. If f(x) = 1/(x + 2), then f(f(x)) would be f applied to 1/(x + 2). So substituting into f, we get 1 / [ (1/(x + 2)) + 2 ]. Let's compute that denominator: 1/(x + 2) + 2. To combine these terms, express 2 as 2(x + 2)/(x + 2), so that becomes [1 + 2(x + 2)] / (x + 2). Expanding the numerator: 1 + 2x + 4 = 2x + 5. So the denominator of f(f(x)) is (2x + 5)/(x + 2), so f(f(x)) = 1 / [ (2x + 5)/(x + 2) ) ] = (x + 2)/(2x + 5). Then plugging x = 1 into this composed function: (1 + 2)/(2*1 + 5) = 3/7. That's another way to verify the result. \n\nThis method of composing the functions first and then substituting might be a good check.

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, we have a polynomial z\u2076 - 10z\u2075 + Az\u2074 + Bz\u00b3 + Cz\u00b2 + Dz + 16, and all its roots are positive integers, possibly repeated. We need to find the value of B, which is the coefficient of z\u00b3. The answer choices suggest it's a negative number, and we need to show it's -88.\n\nFirst, I remember that for polynomials with integer roots, Vieta's formulas relate the coefficients to the sums and products of the roots. Since all roots are positive integers, we can denote them as r\u2081, r\u2082, ..., r\u2086. Then, the polynomial can be written as (z - r\u2081)(z - r\u2082)...(z - r\u2086).\n\nGiven the polynomial is monic (leading coefficient 1), the constant term is the product of the roots with a sign. Here, the constant term is 16, and since all roots are positive, their product is 16. So, r\u2081r\u2082r\u2083r\u2084r\u2085r\u2086 = 16.\n\nAlso, the coefficient of z\u2075 is -10, which by Vieta's formula is equal to the negative of the sum of the roots. Therefore, the sum of the roots is 10: r\u2081 + r\u2082 + ... + r\u2086 = 10.\n\nSo, we need to find six positive integers that add up to 10 and multiply to 16. Let's list the possible combinations. Since 16 factors into primes as 2\u2074, but we have six factors. Since 16 = 2^4, but we need six numbers. The only way to split 16 into six positive integers is to use 1s and 2s, because 1s don't affect the product. Let's see:\n\nPossible roots: Since 16 = 2^4, and we need six numbers. Let's think of how many 2s and 1s we need. Each 2 contributes a factor of 2, and each 1 contributes 1. So, if we have four 2s and two 1s, the product is 2^4 * 1^2 = 16. That works. Let's check the sum: four 2s sum to 8, and two 1s sum to 2, total 10. Perfect, that matches the sum required.\n\nSo the roots must be four 2s and two 1s. Therefore, the roots are 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2.\n\nNow, we need to find the coefficient B, which is the coefficient of z\u00b3. Using Vieta's formula, the coefficient B is related to the sum of the products of the roots taken three at a time, but with a sign. Wait, let me recall Vieta's formulas for a monic polynomial:\n\nFor a monic polynomial z\u207f + a\u2081z\u207f\u207b\u00b9 + ... + a\u2099 = 0,\n\nThe coefficient a_k is (-1)^k times the sum of the products of the roots taken (n - k) at a time. Wait, no, wait. Let me get this right. For a monic polynomial (z - r\u2081)(z - r\u2082)...(z - r\u2099) = z\u207f - S\u2081z\u207f\u207b\u00b9 + S\u2082z\u207f\u207b\u00b2 - ... + (-1)\u207fS\u2099, where S\u2081 is the sum of roots, S\u2082 is the sum of products of roots two at a time, etc.\n\nSo in our case, the polynomial is z\u2076 - 10z\u2075 + Az\u2074 + Bz\u00b3 + Cz\u00b2 + Dz + 16. Comparing to the general form, the coefficient of z\u00b3 is S\u2083, but with a sign. Wait, let's see:\n\nThe expansion is z\u2076 - (sum roots)z\u2075 + (sum products two at a time)z\u2074 - (sum products three at a time)z\u00b3 + ... + (-1)^6(product of all roots). So the coefficient of z\u00b3 is - (sum of products of roots three at a time). Therefore, B = - (sum of products of roots three at a time).\n\nSo we need to compute the sum of all possible products of three roots and then take the negative of that to get B.\n\nGiven the roots are 1,1,2,2,2,2. Let's compute this sum.\n\nFirst, let's list all possible combinations of three roots. Since there are repetitions, we need to account for duplicates.\n\nBut since the roots are not distinct, we can use combinations with repetition, but actually, since the roots are specific numbers (two 1s and four 2s), we can categorize the possible triples based on how many 1s and 2s they include.\n\nPossible cases for triples:\n\n0 ones, 3 twos: All three are 2s. The product is 2*2*2=8. How many such combinations? Since there are four 2s, the number of ways to choose 3 is C(4,3)=4. So total contribution: 4*8=32.\n\n1 one, 2 twos: Product is 1*2*2=4. Number of such combinations: C(2,1)*C(4,2). Wait, we have two 1s and four 2s. Choosing 1 one and 2 twos. So C(2,1) ways to choose the 1, and C(4,2) ways to choose the 2s. So 2 * 6 = 12 combinations. Each contributes 4, so total 12*4=48.\n\n2 ones, 1 two: Product is 1*1*2=2. Number of combinations: C(2,2)*C(4,1)=1*4=4. So total contribution: 4*2=8.\n\n3 ones: Not possible because there are only two 1s. So this case is 0.\n\nSo total sum of products three at a time is 32 + 48 + 8 = 88. Therefore, B = -88. Hence the answer is A) -88.\n\nWait, let me verify the calculations again to be sure.\n\nFirst case: three 2s. There are four 2s, so choosing 3: C(4,3)=4. Each product is 8, so 4*8=32. Correct.\n\nSecond case: one 1 and two 2s. Number of ways: choose 1 out of two 1s and 2 out of four 2s. So 2 * 6 =12. Each product is 1*2*2=4. 12*4=48. Correct.\n\nThird case: two 1s and one 2. But we only have two 1s, so choosing both 1s and one 2. Number of ways: C(2,2)*C(4,1)=1*4=4. Each product is 1*1*2=2. 4*2=8. Correct.\n\nTotal sum: 32+48+8=88. Therefore, B = -88. That's answer choice A. So the proof is correct.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nWe need to determine the value of \\( B \\) in the polynomial \\( z^6 - 10z^5 + Az^4 + Bz^3 + Cz^2 + Dz + 16 \\), given that all roots are positive integers. \n\n**Key Observations:**\n1. **Vieta's Formulas:** For a monic polynomial \\( (z - r_1)(z - r_2)\\dots(z - r_6) \\), the constant term is the product of the roots \\( r_1r_2\\dots r_6 = 16 \\), and the coefficient of \\( z^5 \\) is the negative sum of the roots: \\( -(r_1 + r_2 + \\dots + r_6) = -10 \\), so \\( r_1 + r_2 + \\dots + r_6 = 10 \\).\n\n2. **Root Constraints:** The roots are positive integers.

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, we have two equations involving a and b. The first one is a squared times b cubed equals 32 over 27. The second equation is a divided by b cubed equals 27 over 4. We need to find a + b and show that it's 8/3.\n\nHmm, let me start by writing down the equations to get a clear picture. The first equation is a\u00b2b\u00b3 = 32/27, and the second is a/(b\u00b3) = 27/4. Maybe I can solve one of these equations for a variable and substitute into the other. Let's see.\n\nLooking at the second equation, a/(b\u00b3) = 27/4. If I solve for a, that would give me a = (27/4) * b\u00b3. That seems useful because then I can substitute this expression for a into the first equation. Let's try that.\n\nSubstituting a = (27/4)b\u00b3 into the first equation: ( (27/4)b\u00b3 )\u00b2 * b\u00b3 = 32/27. Let's compute the left side step by step. First, square (27/4)b\u00b3. Squaring 27/4 gives (27\u00b2)/(4\u00b2) = 729/16. Squaring b\u00b3 gives b\u2076. So, the squared term is (729/16)b\u2076. Then we multiply by b\u00b3, which gives (729/16)b\u2079. So the equation becomes (729/16)b\u2079 = 32/27.\n\nNow, solve for b\u2079. Multiply both sides by 16/729 to isolate b\u2079. That gives b\u2079 = (32/27)*(16/729). Let me compute that. Multiply the numerators: 32*16 = 512. Multiply the denominators: 27*729. Wait, 27 times 729. Let me calculate that. 27*700 = 18,900 and 27*29 = 783, so total is 18,900 + 783 = 19,683. So, b\u2079 = 512/19,683.\n\nHmm, 512 is 2^9, right? Because 2^10 is 1024, so 2^9 is 512. And 19,683. Let me check if that's 3^9. 3^6 is 729, 3^7 is 2187, 3^8 is 6561, 3^9 is 19,683. Yes! So, 19,683 is 3^9. Therefore, b\u2079 = (2^9)/(3^9) = (2/3)^9. So, taking the ninth root of both sides, b = 2/3. Since we're dealing with real numbers and exponents, the real ninth root of (2/3)^9 is 2/3.\n\nOkay, so b = 2/3. Now, substitute back into the expression for a. Earlier, we had a = (27/4)b\u00b3. Let's compute b\u00b3 first. (2/3)^3 = 8/27. Then, a = (27/4)*(8/27). The 27 in the numerator and denominator cancels out, leaving 8/4 = 2. So, a = 2.\n\nTherefore, a = 2 and b = 2/3. Adding them together, a + b = 2 + 2/3 = 8/3. That's the answer we were supposed to show. Let me double-check the steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, solving the second equation for a gives a = (27/4)b\u00b3. Substituting into the first equation, we squared that term correctly and multiplied by b\u00b3. Then, solving for b\u2079 gave us 512/19,683, which simplifies to (2/3)^9. Taking the ninth root gives b = 2/3. Plugging back into a's expression gives a = 2. Adding them gives 8/3. Everything checks out. I think that's solid.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nLet's start with the given equations: \\( a^2b^3 = \\frac{32}{27} \\) and \\( \\frac{a}{b^3} = \\frac{27}{4} \\). Our goal is to find \\( a + b \\).\n\nFirst, solve the second equation for \\( a \\). Rearranging \\( \\frac{a}{b^3} = \\frac{27}{4} \\), we get:\n\\[\na = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot b^3.\n\\]\nNow substitute this expression for \\( a \\) into the first equation \\( a^2b^3 = \\frac{32}{27} \\):\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{27}{4} \\cdot b^3\\right)^2 \\cdot b^3 = \\frac{32}{27}.\n\\]\nSimplify the left-hand side:\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{27^2}{4^2}\\right) \\cdot b^6 \\cdot b^3 = \\frac{729}{16} \\cdot b^9.\n\\]\nThis gives:\n\\[\n\\frac{729}{16} \\cdot b^9 = \\frac{32}{27}.\n\\]\nSolve for \\( b^9 \\) by multiplying both sides by \\( \\frac{16}{729} \\):\n\\[\nb^9 = \\frac{32}{27} \\cdot \\frac{16}{729} = \\frac{512}{19,\\!683}.\n\\]\nNotice that \\( 512 = 2^9 \\) and \\( 19,\\!683 = 3^9 \\), so:\n\\[\nb^9 = \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^9.\n\\]\nTaking the ninth root of both sides (valid for real numbers), we find:\n\\[\nb = \\frac{2}{3}.\n\\]\nSubstitute \\( b = \\frac{2}{3} \\) back into \\( a = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot b^3 \\):\n\\[\na = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^3 = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot \\frac{8}{27} = \\frac{8}{4} = 2.\n\\]\nFinally, add \\( a \\) and \\( b \\):\n\\[\na + b = 2 + \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{8}{3}.\n\\]\nThus, \\( a + b = \\frac{8}{3} \\), as required.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'pow_eq_pow_iff_eq'\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'pow_eq_pow_iff_eq'\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'pow_eq_pow_iff_eq'\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The question says that the product of two consecutive positive even integers is 288, and we need to show that the greater of these two integers is 18. Alright, so first, let's understand what consecutive positive even integers are. Consecutive even numbers are numbers like 2, 4, 6, 8, etc., where each is 2 more than the previous. So if one integer is, say, n, the next consecutive even integer would be n + 2.\n\nThe problem states that their product is 288. So, if the smaller integer is n, the next one is n + 2, and their product is n*(n + 2) = 288. We need to solve for n and then find the greater one, which would be n + 2. The answer should be 18, so we need to verify that.\n\nLet me set up the equation. Let n be the smaller even integer. Then the next one is n + 2. So:\n\nn(n + 2) = 288\n\nExpanding this, we get:\n\nn\u00b2 + 2n = 288\n\nThen, bringing 288 to the left side:\n\nn\u00b2 + 2n - 288 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation. To solve for n, we can use the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is n = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 - 4ac)]/(2a). Here, a = 1, b = 2, c = -288.\n\nCalculating the discriminant first:\n\nb\u00b2 - 4ac = (2)\u00b2 - 4*1*(-288) = 4 + 1152 = 1156\n\nThe square root of 1156 is 34, since 34*34 = 1156. So,\n\nn = [-2 \u00b1 34]/2\n\nThis gives two solutions:\n\nn = (-2 + 34)/2 = 32/2 = 16\n\nn = (-2 - 34)/2 = -36/2 = -18\n\nBut since we're dealing with positive integers, we discard the negative solution. So n = 16. Therefore, the next consecutive even integer is 16 + 2 = 18. That's the greater one, so that checks out.\n\nWait, but maybe there's another way to approach this without using the quadratic formula? Let me think. Since we're dealing with integers, perhaps factoring the equation or estimating.\n\nLet's see. The product of two numbers is 288, and they are even and consecutive. Let's list the factors of 288 and see which pair fits. 288 is even, so all factors are even. Let's find pairs of even numbers that multiply to 288.\n\nStarting from the middle: sqrt(288) is approximately 16.97. So the factors around that. Let's see:\n\n16 * 18 = 288. Yes, that's exactly the pair. 16 and 18 are consecutive even integers, and their product is 288. So the greater one is 18. That's straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't think of that, maybe trial and error. Let's try some even numbers. Let's say 14 and 16: 14*16=224, which is less than 288. 16*18=288. There we go. So that's the pair. So the answer is 18.\n\nTherefore, the greater integer is 18. The problem is solved. But let me make sure there's no other pair. Suppose someone picks higher numbers. For example, 20 and 22: 20*22=440, which is way higher. So no. Lower numbers: 12*14=168, too low. So 16 and 18 are the only consecutive even integers whose product is 288. Hence, 18 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo find the greater of two consecutive positive even integers whose product is 288, let\u2019s denote the smaller integer as \\( n \\). The next consecutive even integer is \\( n + 2 \\). Their product is given by:\n\n\\[\nn(n + 2) = 288\n\\]\n\nExpanding and rearranging gives the quadratic equation:\n\n\\[\nn^2 + 2n - 288 = 0\n\\]\n\nWe solve this by factoring or using the quadratic formula. However, since we\u2019re dealing with integers, we can look for pairs of even factors of 288. The square root of 288 is approximately 16.97, so we check pairs near this value.

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, we have two different positive numbers a and b, each of which differs from their reciprocals by 1. We need to find a + b, and the answer is supposed to be \u221a5. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the problem statement. Each number differs from its reciprocal by 1. That means for a number x, either x - 1/x = 1 or 1/x - x = 1. But since the numbers are positive, we need to check which of these makes sense.\n\nWait, the problem says \"differs from their reciprocals by 1\". The wording is a bit ambiguous. It could mean x - 1/x = 1 or 1/x - x = 1. Let's consider both possibilities. But since a and b are positive, let's see which equations have positive solutions.\n\nLet's take the first case: x - 1/x = 1. Multiply both sides by x to eliminate the denominator. That gives x\u00b2 - 1 = x. Rearranging, x\u00b2 - x - 1 = 0. Solving this quadratic equation, the discriminant is 1 + 4 = 5, so roots are [1 \u00b1 \u221a5]/2. Since x is positive, we take the positive root: [1 + \u221a5]/2.\n\nSecond case: 1/x - x = 1. Multiply both sides by x: 1 - x\u00b2 = x. Rearranging, x\u00b2 + x - 1 = 0. The discriminant here is 1 + 4 = 5, so roots are [-1 \u00b1 \u221a5]/2. Again, positive root is [-1 + \u221a5]/2. Wait, that's positive because \u221a5 is about 2.236, so -1 + 2.236 \u2248 1.236, divided by 2 is about 0.618. So that's positive.\n\nSo there are two equations here. Each equation gives one solution. So the two numbers a and b must be the solutions to these two equations. Let's verify that.\n\nSo, the first equation x - 1/x = 1 gives x = [1 + \u221a5]/2, and the second equation 1/x - x = 1 gives x = [-1 + \u221a5]/2. Let's check if these are reciprocals of each other. Let me compute their product. Let\u2019s take the first solution: [1 + \u221a5]/2. The second solution is [-1 + \u221a5]/2. Multiply them: ([1 + \u221a5]/2) * ([-1 + \u221a5]/2) = [(\u221a5 +1)(\u221a5 -1)]/(4) = (5 -1)/4 = 4/4 = 1. Oh, so they are reciprocals. That makes sense. Because if x is a solution to x - 1/x =1, then 1/x would satisfy 1/x - x = -1, but maybe not exactly. Wait, let's see.\n\nWait, if x satisfies x - 1/x =1, then 1/x would satisfy 1/x - x = -1. But the problem states that each number differs from its reciprocal by 1. So if x is a solution to x - 1/x =1, then 1/x would be a solution to 1/x - (1/(1/x)) = 1/x - x = -1, which is not the same as the other equation. Wait, but the problem says \"differs from their reciprocals by 1\", which could mean the absolute difference is 1. But the problem says \"each differ from their reciprocals by 1\", so maybe each of them satisfies either x - 1/x =1 or 1/x -x =1. But since a and b are different, they must be the two distinct solutions of these equations.\n\nWait, but actually, solving x - 1/x =1 gives x = [1 + \u221a5]/2, and solving 1/x -x =1 gives x = [-1 + \u221a5]/2. Let me check if these are the same. Let's compute [1 + \u221a5]/2 \u2248 (1 + 2.236)/2 \u2248 1.618, and [-1 + \u221a5]/2 \u2248 (1.236)/2 \u2248 0.618. So these are two distinct positive numbers. Therefore, a and b are these two numbers. Then a + b would be [1 + \u221a5]/2 + [-1 + \u221a5]/2 = (1 -1 + \u221a5 + \u221a5)/2 = (2\u221a5)/2 = \u221a5. So that's the answer, which is option C.\n\nBut let me make sure there are no other possibilities. The problem states that there are two different positive numbers a and b. So we have two equations, each giving one solution, and their sum is \u221a5. Therefore, the answer is \u221a5.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different approach. Let's suppose that both a and b satisfy the same equation, but since they are different, that's not possible. Each quadratic equation has only one positive root. So the two numbers must come from the two different equations. Hence, their sum is \u221a5.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo solve the problem, we start by translating the condition that each number differs from its reciprocal by 1 into equations. Let\u2019s denote one of the numbers as \\( x \\). The statement \"differs from its reciprocal by 1\" can mean either \\( x - \\frac{1}{x} = 1 \\) or \\( \\frac{1}{x} - x = 1 \\). We analyze both cases:\n\n1. **Case 1: \\( x - \\frac{1}{x} = 1 \\)**  \n   Multiply through by \\( x \\):  \n   \\[\n   x^2 - 1 = x \\implies x^2 - x - 1 = 0.\n   \\]  \n   Solving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \\( x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\), we get:  \n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{5}}{2}.\n   \\]  \n   Since \\( x \\) is positive, we take the positive root:  \n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Case 2: \\( \\frac{1}{x} - x = 1 \\)**  \n   Multiply through by \\( x \\):  \n   \\[\n   1 - x^2 = x \\implies x^2 + x - 1 = 0.\n   \\]  \n   Solving this quadratic equation:  \n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{5}}{2}.\n   \\]  \n   Again, taking the positive root:  \n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}.\n   \\]\n\n**Key Observations:**  \n- The two solutions \\( \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2} \\) and \\( \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2} \\) are distinct positive numbers.  \n- These numbers are reciprocals of each other. Multiplying them gives:  \n  \\[\n  \\left(\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}\\right) = \\frac{(\\sqrt{5})^2 - 1^2}{4} = \\frac{5 - 1}{4} = 1.\n  \\]\n\n**Sum of the Solutions:**  \nAdding the two numbers:  \n\\[\n\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2} + \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2} = \\frac{(1 - 1) + (\\sqrt{5} + \\sqrt{5})}{2} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{5}}{2} = \\sqrt{5}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the two distinct positive numbers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) satisfying the given condition sum to \\( \\sqrt{5} \\). The answer is \\(\\boxed{\\sqrt{5}}\\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'abs_eq_one.mp'\nunsolved goals\ncase inl.h.h.h.a\na b : \u211d\nh\u2080 : 0 < a \u2227 0 < b\nh\u2081 : a \u2260 b\nh\u2082 : |a - 1 / a| = 1\nh\u2083 : |b - 1 / b| = 1\nh\u2084 : a - 1 / a = 1\n\u22a2 a + (a\u207b\u00b9 - \u221a5) = 0\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  -1\ncase inr.h.h.h.a\na b : \u211d\nh\u2080 : 0 < a \u2227 0 < b\nh\u2081 : a \u2260 b\nh\u2082 : |a - 1 / a| = 1\nh\u2083 : |b - 1 / b| = 1\nh\u2084 : a - 1 / a = -1\n\u22a2 2 * a - (1 - \u221a5) = 0\nunknown identifier 'abs_eq_one.mp'\nunsolved goals\ncase inl.h.h.h.a\na b : \u211d\nh\u2080 : 0 < a \u2227 0 < b\nh\u2081 : a \u2260 b\nh\u2082 : |a - 1 / a| = 1\nh\u2083 : |b - 1 / b| = 1\nh\u2084 : a = (1 + \u221a5) / 2 \u2228 a = (1 - \u221a5) / 2\nh\u2085 : b - 1 / b = 1\n\u22a2 b + (b\u207b\u00b9 - \u221a5) = 0\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  -1\ncase inr.h.h.h.a\na b : \u211d\nh\u2080 : 0 < a \u2227 0 < b\nh\u2081 : a \u2260 b\nh\u2082 : |a - 1 / a| = 1\nh\u2083 : |b - 1 / b| = 1\nh\u2084 : a = (1 + \u221a5) / 2 \u2228 a = (1 - \u221a5) / 2\nh\u2085 : b - 1 / b = -1\n\u22a2 2 * b - (1 - \u221a5) = 0\nunsolved goals\ncase inl.inl\na b : \u211d\nh\u2080 : 0 < a \u2227 0 < b\nh\u2081 : a \u2260 b\nh\u2082 : |a - 1 / a| = 1\nh\u2083 : |b - 1 / b| = 1\nh\u2084 : a = (1 + \u221a5) / 2\nh\u2085 : b = (1 + \u221a5) / 2\n\u22a2 1 + \u221a5 = \u221a5\nunsolved goals\ncase inl.inr\na b : \u211d\nh\u2080 : 0 < a \u2227 0 < b\nh\u2081 : a \u2260 b\nh\u2082 : |a - 1 / a| = 1\nh\u2083 : |b - 1 / b| = 1\nh\u2084 : a = (1 + \u221a5) / 2\nh\u2085 : b = (1 - \u221a5) / 2\n\u22a2 1 = \u221a5\nunsolved goals\ncase inr.inl\na b : \u211d\nh\u2080 : 0 < a \u2227 0 < b\nh\u2081 : a \u2260 b\nh\u2082 : |a - 1 / a| = 1\nh\u2083 : |b - 1 / b| = 1\nh\u2084 : a = (1 - \u221a5) / 2\nh\u2085 : b = (1 + \u221a5) / 2\n\u22a2 1 = \u221a5\nunsolved goals\ncase inr.inr\na b : \u211d\nh\u2080 : 0 < a \u2227 0 < b\nh\u2081 : a \u2260 b\nh\u2082 : |a - 1 / a| = 1\nh\u2083 : |b - 1 / b| = 1\nh\u2084 : a = (1 - \u221a5) / 2\nh\u2085 : b = (1 - \u221a5) / 2\n\u22a2 1 - \u221a5 = \u221a5\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'abs_eq_one.mp'\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase inl.h.h.h.a.h1.h\na b : \u211d\nh\u2080 : 0 < a \u2227 0 < b\nh\u2081 : a \u2260 b\nh\u2082 : |a - 1 / a| = 1\nh\u2083 : |b - 1 / b| = 1\nh\u2084 : a - 1 / a = 1\na\u271d : 2 * a < 1 + \u221a5\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase inr.h.h.h.a.h1.h\na b : \u211d\nh\u2080 : 0 < a \u2227 0 < b\nh\u2081 : a \u2260 b\nh\u2082 : |a - 1 / a| = 1\nh\u2083 : |b - 1 / b| = 1\nh\u2084 : a - 1 / a = -1\na\u271d : 2 * a < 1 - \u221a5\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nunknown identifier 'abs_eq_one.mp'\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase inl.h.h.h.a.h1.h\na b : \u211d\nh\u2080 : 0 < a \u2227 0 < b\nh\u2081 : a \u2260 b\nh\u2082 : |a - 1 / a| = 1\nh\u2083 : |b - 1 / b| = 1\nh\u2084 : a = (1 + \u221a5) / 2 \u2228 a = (1 - \u221a5) / 2\nh\u2085 : b - 1 / b = 1\na\u271d : 2 * b < 1 + \u221a5\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase inr.h.h.h.a.h1.h\na b : \u211d\nh\u2080 : 0 < a \u2227 0 < b\nh\u2081 : a \u2260 b\nh\u2082 : |a - 1 / a| = 1\nh\u2083 : |b - 1 / b| = 1\nh\u2084 : a = (1 + \u221a5) / 2 \u2228 a = (1 - \u221a5) / 2\nh\u2085 : b - 1 / b = -1\na\u271d : 2 * b < 1 - \u221a5\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nunsolved goals\ncase inl.inl\na b : \u211d\nh\u2080 : 0 < a \u2227 0 < b\nh\u2081 : a \u2260 b\nh\u2082 : |a - 1 / a| = 1\nh\u2083 : |b - 1 / b| = 1\nh\u2084 : a = (1 + \u221a5) / 2\nh\u2085 : b = (1 + \u221a5) / 2\n\u22a2 1 + \u221a5 = \u221a5\nunsolved goals\ncase inl.inr\na b : \u211d\nh\u2080 : 0 < a \u2227 0 < b\nh\u2081 : a \u2260 b\nh\u2082 : |a - 1 / a| = 1\nh\u2083 : |b - 1 / b| = 1\nh\u2084 : a = (1 + \u221a5) / 2\nh\u2085 : b = (1 - \u221a5) / 2\n\u22a2 1 = \u221a5\nunsolved goals\ncase inr.inl\na b : \u211d\nh\u2080 : 0 < a \u2227 0 < b\nh\u2081 : a \u2260 b\nh\u2082 : |a - 1 / a| = 1\nh\u2083 : |b - 1 / b| = 1\nh\u2084 : a = (1 - \u221a5) / 2\nh\u2085 : b = (1 + \u221a5) / 2\n\u22a2 1 = \u221a5\nunsolved goals\ncase inr.inr\na b : \u211d\nh\u2080 : 0 < a \u2227 0 < b\nh\u2081 : a \u2260 b\nh\u2082 : |a - 1 / a| = 1\nh\u2083 : |b - 1 / b| = 1\nh\u2084 : a = (1 - \u221a5) / 2\nh\u2085 : b = (1 - \u221a5) / 2\n\u22a2 1 - \u221a5 = \u221a5\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to prove that for a triangle with sides a, b, c, the expression a\u00b2(b + c - a) + b\u00b2(c + a - b) + c\u00b2(a + b - c) is less than or equal to 3abc. Hmm, let's start by understanding what each part of this expression represents. \n\nFirst, I recall that in a triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side. So, terms like (b + c - a) must be positive because, for example, b + c > a in a valid triangle. That means each of the terms being multiplied by the squares of the sides is positive. So the entire left-hand side (LHS) is a sum of positive terms. \n\nThe inequality is comparing this sum to 3abc. Maybe I can manipulate the inequality to bring everything to one side and see if I can factor it or find some known inequality that applies. Let's write the inequality as:\n\na\u00b2(b + c - a) + b\u00b2(c + a - b) + c\u00b2(a + b - c) - 3abc \u2264 0.\n\nHmm, maybe expanding the left-hand side would help.

Let's see:\n\n- The terms with a\u00b2b and b\u00b2a: a\u00b2b + b\u00b2a = ab(a + b)\n- Similarly, a\u00b2c + c\u00b2a = ac(a + c)\n- b\u00b2c + c\u00b2b = bc(b + c)\n- Then the negative terms: -a\u00b3 - b\u00b3 - c\u00b3\n- And the -3abc term.\n\nSo combining these:\n\nab(a + b) + ac(a + c) + bc(b + c) - a\u00b3 - b\u00b3 - c\u00b3 - 3abc.\n\nWait, maybe we can factor this expression. Let's see. Let's consider each pair:\n\nTake ab(a + b) - a\u00b3 - b\u00b3. Let's compute that:\n\nab(a + b) - a\u00b3 - b\u00b3 = a\u00b2b + ab\u00b2 - a\u00b3 - b\u00b3 = -a\u00b3 + a\u00b2b + ab\u00b2 - b\u00b3.\n\nFactor this as -a\u00b3 - b\u00b3 + a\u00b2b + ab\u00b2. Hmm, maybe factor by grouping:\n\n(-a\u00b3 + a\u00b2b) + (-b\u00b3 + ab\u00b2) = a\u00b2(-a + b) + b\u00b2(-b + a) = (a\u00b2 - b\u00b2)(b - a) = (a - b)(a + b)(b - a) = - (a - b)^2 (a + b).\n\nWait, that's interesting. So for each pair, like ab(a + b) - a\u00b3 - b\u00b3, it's equal to - (a - b)^2 (a + b). Let me check that again.\n\nWait, let's take ab(a + b) - a\u00b3 - b\u00b3. Let's factor:\n\nab(a + b) - a\u00b3 - b\u00b3 = a\u00b2b + ab\u00b2 - a\u00b3 - b\u00b3 = a\u00b2(b - a) + b\u00b2(a - b) = a\u00b2(b - a) - b\u00b2(b - a) = (b - a)(a\u00b2 - b\u00b2) = (b - a)(a - b)(a + b) = - (a - b)^2 (a + b). Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo each of these terms ab(a + b) - a\u00b3 - b\u00b3 is equal to - (a - b)^2 (a + b). Similarly, the same would apply for the other pairs. So applying this to all three pairs:\n\nab(a + b) + ac(a + c) + bc(b + c) - a\u00b3 - b\u00b3 - c\u00b3 = - (a - b)^2 (a + b) - (a - c)^2 (a + c) - (b - c)^2 (b + c).\n\nSo substituting back into the original expression:\n\nLeft-hand side (LHS) - 3abc = [ab(a + b) + ac(a + c) + bc(b + c) - a\u00b3 - b\u00b3 - c\u00b3] - 3abc = - (a - b)^2 (a + b) - (a - c)^2 (a + c) - (b - c)^2 (b + c) - 3abc.\n\nWait, but this seems complicated. Maybe there's another approach. Let's think about using known inequalities like AM \u2265 GM or other symmetric inequalities. Alternatively, maybe homogenizing the inequality or using substitution.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is symmetric in a, b, c, perhaps assuming that a = b = c would give equality. Let's check that. If a = b = c, then each term becomes a\u00b2(a + a - a) = a\u00b2(a) = a\u00b3. There are three such terms, so LHS = 3a\u00b3. The right-hand side (RHS) is 3a\u00b3. So equality holds when the triangle is equilateral. That's a good check.\n\nNow, perhaps we can use the Ravi substitution, where we let a = y + z, b = z + x, c = x + y, where x, y, z are positive real numbers. This substitution is often useful in triangle inequalities because it automatically satisfies the triangle inequalities. Let's try that.\n\nLet a = y + z, b = z + x, c = x + y. Then, substituting into the LHS:\n\na\u00b2(b + c - a) = (y + z)^2 ( (z + x) + (x + y) - (y + z) ) = (y + z)^2 (2x).\n\nSimilarly, b\u00b2(c + a - b) = (z + x)^2 (2y), and c\u00b2(a + b - c) = (x + y)^2 (2z).\n\nSo the LHS becomes 2x(y + z)^2 + 2y(z + x)^2 + 2z(x + y)^2.\n\nThe RHS is 3abc = 3(y + z)(z + x)(x + y).\n\nSo the inequality becomes:\n\n2x(y + z)^2 + 2y(z + x)^2 + 2z(x + y)^2 \u2264 3(y + z)(z + x)(x + y).\n\nDivide both sides by (y + z)(z + x)(x + y) (which is positive), so the inequality simplifies to:\n\n2x(y + z)/(x + y) + 2y(z + x)/(y + z) + 2z(x + y)/(z + x) \u2264 3.\n\nWait, no, let me check that again. Wait, when we divide both sides by (y + z)(z + x)(x + y), the left-hand side becomes:\n\n[2x(y + z)^2]/[(y + z)(z + x)(x + y)] + [2y(z + x)^2]/[(y + z)(z + x)(x + y)] + [2z(x + y)^2]/[(y + z)(z + x)(x + y)].\n\nSimplifying each term:\n\nFirst term: 2x(y + z)/[(z + x)(x + y)]\n\nSecond term: 2y(z + x)/[(y + z)(x + y)]\n\nThird term: 2z(x + y)/[(y + z)(z + x)]\n\nSo the inequality becomes:\n\n2x(y + z)/[(z + x)(x + y)] + 2y(z + x)/[(y + z)(x + y)] + 2z(x + y)/[(y + z)(z + x)] \u2264 3.\n\nHmm, this seems a bit messy. Maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, perhaps expanding both sides and comparing terms.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the original inequality again:\n\na\u00b2(b + c - a) + b\u00b2(c + a - b) + c\u00b2(a + b - c) \u2264 3abc.\n\nLet me try to rearrange terms. Let's move all terms to the left:\n\na\u00b2(b + c - a) + b\u00b2(c + a - b) + c\u00b2(a + b - c) - 3abc \u2264 0.\n\nAlternatively, factor terms. Let's see:\n\nEach term like a\u00b2(b + c - a) can be written as a\u00b2(b + c) - a\u00b3. So the entire expression becomes:\n\na\u00b2(b + c) + b\u00b2(c + a) + c\u00b2(a + b) - (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3) - 3abc \u2264 0.\n\nNow, notice that a\u00b2(b + c) + b\u00b2(c + a) + c\u00b2(a + b) = a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b.\n\nAnd the expression a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 can be written as a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3.\n\nSo the left-hand side is:\n\n(a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b) - (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3) - 3abc.\n\nThis looks similar to the expression for (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 + 3abc). Let's check:\n\n(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) = a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + ab\u00b2 + b\u00b2c + ac\u00b2 + bc\u00b2 + 3abc.\n\nSo (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 + 3abc) = (a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + ab\u00b2 + b\u00b2c + ac\u00b2 + bc\u00b2 + 3abc) - (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 + 3abc) = a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + ab\u00b2 + b\u00b2c + ac\u00b2 + bc\u00b2 - a\u00b3 - b\u00b3 - c\u00b3.\n\nWhich is exactly the same as our left-hand side expression. Therefore, the left-hand side can be written as:\n\n(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 + 3abc) - 3abc + 3abc? Wait, no. Wait, let me re-express:\n\nWait, our LHS is:\n\n(a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b) - (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3) - 3abc.\n\nWhich is equal to (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3) - 3abc - 3abc? Wait, no. Wait, (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) = a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + ab\u00b2 + b\u00b2c + ac\u00b2 + bc\u00b2 + 3abc. So if we subtract (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 + 3abc), we get:\n\n(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 + 3abc) = (a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + ab\u00b2 + b\u00b2c + ac\u00b2 + bc\u00b2 + 3abc) - (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 + 3abc) = (a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + ab\u00b2 + b\u00b2c + ac\u00b2 + bc\u00b2) - (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3).\n\nBut our LHS is this minus 3abc. Wait, no. Wait, our original LHS is:\n\n(a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b) - (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3) - 3abc.\n\nWhich is equal to [(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc] - (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3) - 3abc.\n\nWait, this seems confusing. Let me think differently. Let's recall that a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 - 3abc = (a + b + c)(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - ab - bc - ca). But here we have the opposite sign. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps factor the expression:\n\n(a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b) - (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3) - 3abc.\n\nLet me group terms:\n\n= a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c - a\u00b3 + b\u00b2c + b\u00b2a - b\u00b3 + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b - c\u00b3 - 3abc.\n\nWhich can be written as:\n\na\u00b2(b + c - a) + b\u00b2(c + a - b) + c\u00b2(a + b - c) - 3abc.\n\nBut that's the original expression. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the identity:\n\na\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 - 3abc = (a + b + c)(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - ab - bc - ca).\n\nBut here we have the negative of that: - (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 - 3abc) = - (a + b + c)(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - ab - bc - ca).\n\nBut our LHS is:\n\n(a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b) - (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3) - 3abc.\n\nWhich can be written as:\n\n(a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b) - (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 + 3abc).\n\nBut I'm not sure if that helps. Let's see:\n\nLet me consider the expression:\n\n(a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b) - (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 + 3abc).\n\nThis can be rewritten as:\n\na\u00b2(b + c - a) + b\u00b2(c + a - b) + c\u00b2(a + b - c) - 3abc.\n\nWait, but that's exactly the original LHS minus 3abc. Wait, no, the original LHS is a\u00b2(b + c - a) + ... which equals this expression. So the inequality is equivalent to this expression \u2264 0.\n\nBut how to show that this expression is \u2264 0?\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the AM-GM inequality. Let's think about each term. For example, a\u00b2(b + c - a). Since in a triangle, b + c - a is positive, but how does this relate to abc?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using substitution variables. Let me set x = b + c - a, y = c + a - b, z = a + b - c. These are the expressions known as the triangle's exradii or related to the inradius. Since a, b, c are sides of a triangle, x, y, z are all positive.\n\nThen, we can express a, b, c in terms of x, y, z:\n\nAdding the equations:\n\nx + y = (b + c - a) + (c + a - b) = 2c\n\nSimilarly, y + z = 2a, and z + x = 2b.\n\nSo, a = (y + z)/2, b = (z + x)/2, c = (x + y)/2.\n\nNow, substituting into the original inequality:\n\na\u00b2(b + c - a) + b\u00b2(c + a - b) + c\u00b2(a + b - c) = a\u00b2x + b\u00b2y + c\u00b2z.\n\nBut since a = (y + z)/2, then a\u00b2x = [(y + z)/2]^2 x.\n\nSimilarly for the other terms. So the LHS becomes:\n\n[(y + z)/2]^2 x + [(z + x)/2]^2 y + [(x + y)/2]^2 z.\n\nThe RHS is 3abc = 3 * [(y + z)/2] * [(z + x)/2] * [(x + y)/2].\n\nSimplifying both sides:\n\nLHS = (1/4)[(y + z)^2 x + (z + x)^2 y + (x + y)^2 z]\n\nRHS = 3/8 (y + z)(z + x)(x + y).\n\nSo the inequality becomes:\n\n(1/4)[(y + z)^2 x + (z + x)^2 y + (x + y)^2 z] \u2264 (3/8)(y + z)(z + x)(x + y).\n\nMultiply both sides by 8 to eliminate denominators:\n\n2[(y + z)^2 x + (z + x)^2 y + (x + y)^2 z] \u2264 3(y + z)(z + x)(x + y).\n\nHmm, this seems similar to the earlier substitution approach. Maybe expanding both sides would help. Let's expand the left-hand side:\n\nLeft-hand side (LHS):\n\n2[ x(y + z)^2 + y(z + x)^2 + z(x + y)^2 ]\n\n= 2[ x(y\u00b2 + 2yz + z\u00b2) + y(z\u00b2 + 2zx + x\u00b2) + z(x\u00b2 + 2xy + y\u00b2) ]\n\n= 2[ xy\u00b2 + 2xyz + xz\u00b2 + yz\u00b2 + 2xyz + yx\u00b2 + zx\u00b2 + 2xyz + zy\u00b2 ]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n= 2[ xy\u00b2 + xz\u00b2 + yz\u00b2 + yx\u00b2 + zx\u00b2 + zy\u00b2 + 6xyz ]\n\n= 2[ x\u00b2y + x\u00b2z + y\u00b2x + y\u00b2z + z\u00b2x + z\u00b2y + 6xyz ]\n\nNow, the right-hand side (RHS):\n\n3(y + z)(z + x)(x + y).\n\nFirst, expand (y + z)(z + x) = yz + yx + z\u00b2 + zx.\n\nThen multiply by (x + y):\n\n= (yz + yx + z\u00b2 + zx)(x + y)\n\n= yz(x) + yz(y) + yx(x) + yx(y) + z\u00b2(x) + z\u00b2(y) + zx(x) + zx(y)\n\n= xyz + y\u00b2z + x\u00b2y + y\u00b2x + xz\u00b2 + yz\u00b2 + x\u00b2z + xyz\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n= x\u00b2y + x\u00b2z + y\u00b2x + y\u00b2z + z\u00b2x + z\u00b2y + 2xyz + 2xyz\n\nWait",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, we have a quadratic equation x\u00b2 - mx + n = 0, and its roots are k and t, with m and n being prime numbers, and k > t. We need to find the value of m\u207f + n\u1d50 + k\u1d57 + t\u1d56 and show it's 20. Alright, let's start by recalling Vieta's formulas because they relate the coefficients of a quadratic to its roots.\n\nVieta's tells us that the sum of the roots k + t equals m, and the product k*t equals n. Since m and n are primes, that gives us some constraints. Let's note that primes are numbers greater than 1 with no divisors other than 1 and themselves. So, m is the sum of two integers k and t, both positive since they're roots of a quadratic with positive coefficients (assuming the equation has positive roots, which it does here because m and n are primes, hence positive). \n\nSince n is prime and it's the product of k and t, the only way two positive integers multiply to a prime is if one of them is 1 and the other is the prime itself. Because primes have exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and themselves. So, either k = 1 and t = n, or t = 1 and k = n. But wait, the problem states that k > t, so t must be 1 and k must be n. Because if t were 1, then k would be n, which is prime. So, the roots are 1 and n. \n\nBut wait, Vieta's sum is k + t = m. So, if t is 1 and k is n, then m = n + 1. But m is also a prime number. So, we have two primes, m and n, where m = n + 1. The only two primes that are consecutive are 2 and 3. Because primes greater than 2 are odd, and adding 1 to an odd number gives an even number, which can't be prime unless it's 2. So, the only consecutive primes are 2 and 3. Therefore, n must be 2 and m must be 3. \n\nLet me check that. If n = 2, then m = 3. The roots would be 1 and 2 (since n = 2, and t = 1, k = 2). Wait, but k has to be greater than t, so k = 2 and t = 1. Then the quadratic equation would be (x - 1)(x - 2) = x\u00b2 - 3x + 2, which matches m = 3 and n = 2. Both 3 and 2 are primes. \n\nNow, compute m\u207f + n\u1d50 + k\u1d57 + t\u1d4f. Plugging in the values: m = 3, n = 2, k = 2, t = 1. So:\n\n3\u00b2 + 2\u00b3 + 2\u00b9 + 1\u00b2 = 9 + 8 + 2 + 1 = 20. That adds up to 20. \n\nWait, but let me make sure there are no other possibilities. Suppose n is another prime. Let's say n = 3, then m would be 4, but 4 isn't prime. If n = 5, m = 6, which isn't prime. The only case where m is prime and n is prime with m = n + 1 is n=2, m=3. So that's the only solution. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 20.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nLet's analyze the quadratic equation \\( x^2 - mx + n = 0 \\) with roots \\( k \\) and \\( t \\), where \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are prime numbers and \\( k > t \\). By Vieta's formulas, we know:\n1. \\( k + t = m \\) (sum of roots),\n2. \\( k \\cdot t = n \\) (product of roots).\n\nSince \\( n \\) is prime, the only way to factor \\( n \\) into two positive integers is \\( 1 \\times n \\). Given \\( k > t \\), this forces \\( t = 1 \\) and \\( k = n \\). Substituting into the sum formula, we get:\n\\[\nm = k + t = n + 1.\n\\]\nNow, \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are consecutive primes. The only consecutive primes are \\( 2 \\) and \\( 3 \\), so \\( n = 2 \\) and \\( m = 3 \\). This gives roots \\( k = 2 \\) and \\( t = 1 \\).\n\nFinally, compute \\( m^n + n^m + k^t + t^k \\):\n\\[\n3^2 + 2^3 + 2^1 + 1^2 = 9 + 8 + 2 + 1 = 20.\n\\]\nThus, the value is **20**.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, we have two natural numbers that add up to 17,402. One of them is divisible by 10, which means it ends with a 0. If we erase the units digit (the 0), we get the other number. We need to find the difference between these two numbers.\n\nFirst, let's denote the numbers. Let's call the number divisible by 10 as N. Since erasing the units digit (which is 0) gives the other number, let's call that other number M. So, if N is, say, 50, then erasing the 0 gives M = 5. But in this case, N is a larger number. The key here is that erasing the last digit of N gives M. That means N is 10 times M. Because erasing the last digit of a number is equivalent to dividing it by 10. For example, 50 becomes 5, 120 becomes 12, etc. So, N = 10*M.\n\nNow, the sum of N and M is 17,402. So, N + M = 17,402. But since N = 10*M, substitute that into the equation: 10*M + M = 11*M = 17,402. Therefore, M = 17,402 / 11. Let me compute that. 11 times 1582 is 17,402 (because 11*1500=16,500; 11*82=902; 16,500 + 902 = 17,402). So M = 1,582. Then N = 10*M = 15,820.\n\nNow, the problem asks for the difference between these two numbers. So, N - M = 15,820 - 1,582. Let's compute that. 15,820 minus 1,582: subtract 1,500 from 15,820 to get 14,320, then subtract 82 more, which gives 14,238. So the difference is 14,238, which is option D.\n\nWait, let me check if there's any possible mistake here. Let's verify the steps again. If N = 10*M, then their sum is 11*M = 17,402. Dividing 17,402 by 11: 11*1,582 = 17,402. Correct. Then N is 15,820. Difference is 15,820 - 1,582 = 14,238. That seems right. The answer should be D.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nLet's denote the two numbers as follows: the number divisible by 10 will be called \\( N \\), and the other number will be \\( M \\). Since erasing the units digit (which is 0) of \\( N \\) gives \\( M \\), this means \\( N \\) is exactly 10 times \\( M \\). For example, if \\( N = 150 \\), erasing the last digit gives \\( M = 15 \\), and indeed \\( N = 10 \\times M \\).\n\nGiven that their sum is \\( 17,\\!402 \\), we can write:\n\\[\nN + M = 17,\\!402\n\\]\nSubstituting \\( N = 10M \\) into the equation:\n\\[\n10M + M = 11M = 17,\\!402\n\\]\nSolving for \\( M \\):\n\\[\nM = \\frac{17,\\!402}{11} = 1,\\!582\n\\]\nThus, \\( N = 10 \\times 1,\\!582 = 15,\\!820 \\).\n\nThe difference between the two numbers is:\n\\[\nN - M = 15,\\!820 - 1,\\!582 = 14,\\!238\n\\]\nThis matches option **D**. To verify, observe that \\( 15,\\!820 + 1,\\!582 = 17,\\!402 \\), confirming the sum, and the units digit of \\( N \\) is erased to produce \\( M \\). The calculations are consistent throughout.\nPrevious attempt failed with: type mismatch\n  Nat.div_mul_cancel h\u2081\nhas type\n  x / 10 * 10 = x : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  x = 10 * (x / 10) : Prop\nunsolved goals\nx y : \u2115\nh\u2080 : 10 * y + y = 17402\nh\u2081 : 10 \u2223 x\nh\u2082 : x / 10 = y\nh\u2083 : x = 10 * y\nh\u2084 : 10 * y + y = 17402\nh\u2085 : 11 * y = 17402\nh\u2086 : y = 1582\n\u22a2 y = 1582\nunsolved goals\nx y : \u2115\nh\u2080 : 10 * y + y = 17402\nh\u2081 : 10 \u2223 x\nh\u2082 : x / 10 = y\nh\u2083 : x = 10 * y\nh\u2084 : 10 * y + y = 17402\nh\u2085 : 11 * y = 17402\nh\u2086 : y = 17402 / 11\nh\u2087 : y = 1582\nh\u2088 : x = 15820\n\u22a2 x = 15820\ntype mismatch\n  h\u2081\u2080\nhas type\n  x - y = 14238 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u2191x - \u2191y = 14238 : Prop\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: no goals to be solved\ntype mismatch\n  h\u2087\nhas type\n  x - y = 14238 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u2191x - \u2191y = 14238 : Prop\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: type mismatch\n  h\u2080\nhas type\n  10 * y + y = 17402 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  11 * y = 17402 : Prop\nno goals to be solved\ntype mismatch\n  h\u2087\nhas type\n  x - y = 14238 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u2191x - \u2191y = 14238 : Prop\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. So we have a sequence of points (a\u2081, b\u2081), (a\u2082, b\u2082), etc., where each subsequent point is defined by the transformation (\u221a3 a\u2099 - b\u2099, \u221a3 b\u2099 + a\u2099). We know that after 99 transformations, the 100th term is (2,4). We need to find a\u2081 + b\u2081, and the answer is supposed to be 1/(2^98). Hmm, how do we approach this?\n\nFirst, the transformation looks like a linear transformation. Maybe it's a rotation or scaling combined with a rotation. Let me think. The transformation matrix would be:\n\n[\u221a3  -1]\n[1    \u221a3]\n\nBecause if you multiply a vector (a, b) by this matrix, you get (\u221a3 a - b, a + \u221a3 b). Wait, but in the problem, the second component is \u221a3 b\u2099 + a\u2099. Oh, right, so the matrix is actually:\n\n[\u221a3  -1]\n[1    \u221a3]\n\nYes, that's correct. So each step is multiplying by this matrix. So applying this matrix 99 times to (a\u2081, b\u2081) gives (2,4). So we need to reverse this process. Instead of going forward 99 steps, we need to go backward from (2,4) to find the original (a\u2081, b\u2081).\n\nBut working with matrices raised to the 99th power might be complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way. Let's see if this matrix can be represented in terms of complex numbers. If we think of each point (a\u2099, b\u2099) as a complex number z\u2099 = a\u2099 + b\u2099 i, then the transformation is z\u2099\u208a\u2081 = (\u221a3 - i) z\u2099. Wait, let's check:\n\nIf z\u2099 = a\u2099 + b\u2099 i, then multiplying by (\u221a3 - i) gives:\n\n(\u221a3)(a\u2099) + (\u221a3)(b\u2099 i) - i(a\u2099) - i(b\u2099 i)\n= \u221a3 a\u2099 + \u221a3 b\u2099 i - i a\u2099 - i\u00b2 b\u2099\n= \u221a3 a\u2099 + \u221a3 b\u2099 i - i a\u2099 + b\u2099 (since i\u00b2 = -1)\n= (\u221a3 a\u2099 + b\u2099) + (\u221a3 b\u2099 - a\u2099) i\n\nBut the problem's transformation is (\u221a3 a\u2099 - b\u2099, \u221a3 b\u2099 + a\u2099). So the real part is \u221a3 a\u2099 - b\u2099, and the imaginary part is \u221a3 b\u2099 + a\u2099. Comparing this to the complex multiplication result:\n\nReal part: \u221a3 a\u2099 + b\u2099 vs. \u221a3 a\u2099 - b\u2099. Hmm, that's different. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me redo it.\n\nWait, the transformation is z\u2099\u208a\u2081 = (\u221a3 - i) z\u2099. Let's compute that:\n\n(\u221a3 - i)(a\u2099 + b\u2099 i) = \u221a3 a\u2099 + \u221a3 b\u2099 i - i a\u2099 - i\u00b2 b\u2099\n= \u221a3 a\u2099 + \u221a3 b\u2099 i - i a\u2099 + b\u2099 (since i\u00b2 = -1)\n= (\u221a3 a\u2099 + b\u2099) + (\u221a3 b\u2099 - a\u2099) i\n\nBut the problem's transformation is (\u221a3 a\u2099 - b\u2099, \u221a3 b\u2099 + a\u2099). So the real part here is \u221a3 a\u2099 - b\u2099, but in the complex multiplication, the real part is \u221a3 a\u2099 + b\u2099. That's a discrepancy. So maybe I need to adjust the complex multiplier. Let's see:\n\nSuppose instead that the transformation is z\u2099\u208a\u2081 = (\u221a3 + i) z\u2099. Let's check that:\n\n(\u221a3 + i)(a\u2099 + b\u2099 i) = \u221a3 a\u2099 + \u221a3 b\u2099 i + i a\u2099 + i\u00b2 b\u2099\n= \u221a3 a\u2099 + \u221a3 b\u2099 i + i a\u2099 - b\u2099\n= (\u221a3 a\u2099 - b\u2099) + (\u221a3 b\u2099 + a\u2099) i\n\nAh, there we go! So the real part is \u221a3 a\u2099 - b\u2099 and the imaginary part is \u221a3 b\u2099 + a\u2099, which matches the problem's transformation. Therefore, each step is multiplication by (\u221a3 + i). Therefore, z\u2099\u208a\u2081 = (\u221a3 + i) z\u2099. So after n steps, z_{n} = (\u221a3 + i)^{n-1} z\u2081. Wait, because z\u2082 = (\u221a3 + i) z\u2081, z\u2083 = (\u221a3 + i) z\u2082 = (\u221a3 + i)^2 z\u2081, etc. So z_{100} = (\u221a3 + i)^{99} z\u2081. But we know z_{100} = 2 + 4i. Therefore, z\u2081 = (2 + 4i) / (\u221a3 + i)^{99}.\n\nBut computing (\u221a3 + i)^{99} seems difficult. However, maybe we can express \u221a3 + i in polar form. Let's find its magnitude and angle.\n\nThe complex number \u221a3 + i has magnitude r = sqrt( (\u221a3)^2 + 1^2 ) = sqrt(3 + 1) = sqrt(4) = 2. The angle \u03b8 is arctangent of (1/\u221a3), which is 30 degrees or \u03c0/6 radians. So \u221a3 + i can be written as 2 (cos \u03c0/6 + i sin \u03c0/6) = 2 e^{i \u03c0/6}.\n\nTherefore, (\u221a3 + i)^{99} = (2 e^{i \u03c0/6})^{99} = 2^{99} e^{i (99 \u03c0/6)}. Simplify 99 \u03c0/6: 99 divided by 6 is 16.5, so 16.5 \u03c0 = 16 \u03c0 + 0.5 \u03c0 = 8*2\u03c0 + \u03c0/2. Since e^{i \u03b8} is periodic with period 2\u03c0, e^{i (16 \u03c0 + \u03c0/2)} = e^{i \u03c0/2} = i. Therefore, (\u221a3 + i)^{99} = 2^{99} * i.\n\nTherefore, z\u2081 = (2 + 4i) / (2^{99} i) = (2 + 4i) / (2^{99} i). Let's compute this. Multiply numerator and denominator by -i to rationalize the denominator:\n\n(2 + 4i)(-i) / (2^{99} i * -i) = (-2i -4i\u00b2) / (2^{99} * 1) = (-2i +4) / 2^{99} = (4 - 2i)/2^{99} = 2^{2}(1 - 0.5i)/2^{99} = (1 - 0.5i)/2^{97}.\n\nWait, let me check that step again. Let's compute (2 + 4i)/(-i * 2^{99}):\n\nFirst, note that 1/i = -i. So (2 + 4i)/(i * 2^{99}) = (2 + 4i) * (-i)/(2^{99} * i * -i) = (2 + 4i)(-i)/(2^{99} * 1) since i*(-i) = 1.\n\nSo (2 + 4i)(-i) = -2i -4i\u00b2 = -2i +4 (since i\u00b2 = -1). So that's 4 - 2i. Then divide by 2^{99}: (4 - 2i)/2^{99} = 2*(2 - i)/2^{99} = (2 - i)/2^{98}.\n\nTherefore, z\u2081 = (2 - i)/2^{98}. So a\u2081 + b\u2081 is the real part plus the imaginary part. Wait, z\u2081 = a\u2081 + b\u2081 i, so a\u2081 is the real part (2)/2^{98} = 1/2^{97}, and b\u2081 is the coefficient of i, which is (-1)/2^{98}. Therefore, a\u2081 + b\u2081 = 1/2^{97} + (-1)/2^{98} = (2 -1)/2^{98} = 1/2^{98}. Which is option D. So that's the answer.\n\nBut let me verify this again step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, representing the transformation as complex numbers: correct, since multiplying by \u221a3 + i gives the required components. Then converting to polar form: \u221a3 + i has magnitude 2 and angle \u03c0/6. Raising to the 99th power: magnitude becomes 2^{99}, angle becomes 99*(\u03c0/6) = 16.5\u03c0. Subtracting multiples of 2\u03c0: 16.5\u03c0 = 8*2\u03c0 + \u03c0/2, so equivalent to \u03c0/2. So e^{i \u03c0/2} is i. Therefore, (\u221a3 + i)^{99} = 2^{99} * i. Correct.\n\nThen z\u2081 = (2 +4i)/(2^{99} *i). Multiplying numerator and denominator by -i: denominator becomes 2^{99}*i*(-i) = 2^{99}*1. Numerator: (2 +4i)*(-i) = -2i -4i\u00b2 = -2i +4. So numerator is 4 -2i. Then divide by 2^{99}: (4 -2i)/2^{99} = 2*(2 -i)/2^{99} = (2 -i)/2^{98}. Therefore, z\u2081 = (2 -i)/2^{98}. So a\u2081 = 2/2^{98} = 1/2^{97}, and b\u2081 = -1/2^{98}. Therefore, a\u2081 + b\u2081 = 1/2^{97} -1/2^{98} = (2 -1)/2^{98} = 1/2^{98}. Yep, that's correct. So the answer is D, 1/2^{98}.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo solve the problem, we recognize that each transformation step can be represented using complex numbers. Let's model each point \\((a_n, b_n)\\) as a complex number \\(z_n = a_n + b_n i\\). The given recurrence relation translates to multiplying by the complex number \\(\\sqrt{3} + i\\) at each step. This is verified by expanding \\((\\sqrt{3} + i)(a_n + b_n i)\\), which matches the components of the transformation.\n\nThe key insight is to express \\(\\sqrt{3} + i\\) in polar form. Its magnitude is \\(2\\) (since \\(|\\sqrt{3} + i| = \\sqrt{(\\sqrt{3})^2 + 1^2} = 2\\)), and its angle is \\(\\pi/6\\) radians. Raising this to the 99th power (to reverse 99 steps from \\(z_{100}\\) to \\(z_1\\)) gives:\n\\[\n(\\sqrt{3} + i)^{99} = \\left(2 e^{i\\pi/6}\\right)^{99} = 2^{99} e^{i(99 \\cdot \\pi/6)}.\n\\]\nSimplifying the angle: \\(99 \\cdot \\pi/6 = 16.5\\pi = 8 \\cdot 2\\pi + \\pi/2\\), which reduces to \\(e^{i\\pi/2} = i\\). Thus, \\((\\sqrt{3} + i)^{99} = 2^{99} \\cdot i\\).\n\nGiven \\(z_{100} = 2 + 4i\\), we reverse the transformation:\n\\[\nz_1 = \\frac{z_{100}}{(\\sqrt{3} + i)^{99}} = \\frac{2 + 4i}{2^{99} \\cdot i}.\n\\]\nMultiplying numerator and denominator by \\(-i\\) to simplify:\n\\[\nz_1 = \\frac{(2 + 4i)(-i)}{2^{99}} = \\frac{4 - 2i}{2^{99}} = \\frac{2 - i}{2^{98}}.\n\\]\nThis corresponds to \\(a_1 = \\frac{2}{2^{98}} = \\frac{1}{2^{97}}\\) and \\(b_1 = \\frac{-1}{2^{98}}\\). Adding these:\n\\[\na_1 + b_1 = \\frac{1}{2^{97}} - \\frac{1}{2^{98}} = \\frac{2 - 1}{2^{98}} = \\frac{1}{2^{98}}.\n\\]\nThus, the answer is \\(\\boxed{\\mathrm{(D)}}\\ \\frac{1}{2^{98}}\\).",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. We need to show the bounds for a, b, c given the conditions a \u2264 b \u2264 c, a + b + c = 2, and ab + bc + ca = 1. Hmm, the context provided earlier involved a similar problem where x + y + z = 1 led to xy + yz + zx < 1/2. Maybe some techniques from there can help here.\n\nFirst, let's recall that in the context, they expanded (x + y + z)^2 to relate the sum of variables to the sum of their products and squares. Let's try that here. If we take (a + b + c)^2, that equals a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2(ab + bc + ca). We know a + b + c = 2 and ab + bc + ca = 1. Plugging those in:\n\n2\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2*1 \u2192 4 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2 \u2192 a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 2.\n\nSo the sum of squares is 2. That might be useful. Also, since a \u2264 b \u2264 c, maybe we can find inequalities based on their ordering.\n\nLet me think about the possible ranges. We need to find lower and upper bounds for each variable. Let's start with variable a. Since a is the smallest, maybe we can find its maximum possible value. Suppose a is as large as possible. If a is maximum, then b and c would be at least a. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe express variables in terms of each other. Let's see. Since a + b + c = 2, we can write c = 2 - a - b. Then substitute into ab + bc + ca = 1:\n\nab + b(2 - a - b) + a(2 - a - b) = 1.\n\nExpanding that: ab + 2b - ab - b\u00b2 + 2a - a\u00b2 - ab = 1.\n\nSimplify terms: ab cancels with -ab, so we have 2b - b\u00b2 + 2a - a\u00b2 - ab = 1.\n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Maybe there's a better approach. Let's consider using inequalities. Since a \u2264 b \u2264 c, we can use the fact that the smallest variable a can't be too large, and the largest variable c can't be too small.\n\nAnother idea: use the method of Lagrange multipliers, but since this is an inequality problem, maybe not necessary. Let's think about the possible values for a. Suppose a is negative. If a is negative, then since a \u2264 b \u2264 c, maybe b and c are positive. But the sum a + b + c = 2, so even if a is negative, the sum of b and c would have to compensate. Let's see.\n\nWait, but the problem states that a, b, c are real numbers. So a could be negative. But the bounds we need to show are 0 \u2264 a \u2264 1/3, which suggests a is non-negative. Wait, but the problem says \"Show that 0 \u2264 a \u2264 1/3\", so maybe a is actually non-negative. Let me check if that's necessarily true.\n\nSuppose a is negative. Then since a \u2264 b \u2264 c, and a + b + c = 2, the other variables must sum to more than 2. Let's see. Let's take a as negative. Let's say a = -k where k > 0. Then b + c = 2 + k. But since b \u2265 a = -k, and c \u2265 b, so c \u2265 b \u2265 -k. But then the sum b + c \u2265 -k + (-k) = -2k. But b + c = 2 + k, so 2 + k \u2265 -2k \u2192 3k \u2265 -2 \u2192 k \u2265 -2/3. But k is positive, so this is always true. Hmm, maybe this isn't helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that ab + bc + ca = 1. If a is negative, then some products might be negative. For example, if a is negative and b and c are positive, then ab and ac are negative, but bc is positive. The sum ab + bc + ca = 1. Let's see if that's possible.\n\nSuppose a = -1 (just as a test). Then b + c = 3. Then ab + bc + ca = (-1)b + bc + (-1)c = -b - c + bc = bc - (b + c) = bc - 3. So bc - 3 = 1 \u2192 bc = 4. But since b + c = 3, the maximum product bc occurs when b = c = 1.5, giving bc = 2.25, which is less than 4. So this is impossible. Therefore, a cannot be -1. So maybe a can't be too negative. Let's check for a = 0. Then b + c = 2, and ab + bc + ca = 0 + bc + 0 = bc = 1. So bc = 1. Then since b + c = 2, the maximum bc is 1 when b = c = 1. So that's possible. So when a = 0, b and c are 1 each. But the problem states that a \u2264 b \u2264 c, so if a = 0, then b and c are at least 0. But in this case, they are 1 each. So that's valid. But the problem wants to show that a \u2265 0. So maybe a can't be negative. Let's see.\n\nSuppose a is negative. Let's assume a < 0. Then, since a \u2264 b \u2264 c, and a + b + c = 2, then b and c must be positive enough to sum to 2 - a. But let's see if ab + bc + ca can be 1. Let's take a = -d where d > 0. Then:\n\nab + bc + ca = (-d)b + bc + (-d)c = bc - d(b + c).\n\nBut since a + b + c = 2, then b + c = 2 - a = 2 + d. So substituting:\n\nab + bc + ca = bc - d(2 + d).\n\nBut we know ab + bc + ca = 1, so:\n\nbc - d(2 + d) = 1 \u2192 bc = 1 + d(2 + d).\n\nBut since b + c = 2 + d, the maximum possible bc is when b = c = (2 + d)/2, so bc \u2264 [(2 + d)/2]^2. Therefore:\n\n1 + d(2 + d) \u2264 [(2 + d)/2]^2.\n\nLet's compute the right-hand side: ( (2 + d)^2 ) /4 = (4 + 4d + d\u00b2)/4 = 1 + d + (d\u00b2)/4.\n\nSo the inequality becomes:\n\n1 + 2d + d\u00b2 \u2264 1 + d + (d\u00b2)/4.\n\nSubtract 1 from both sides:\n\n2d + d\u00b2 \u2264 d + (d\u00b2)/4.\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n2d + d\u00b2 - d - (d\u00b2)/4 = d + (3d\u00b2)/4 \u2264 0.\n\nSo d + (3d\u00b2)/4 \u2264 0. But d > 0 (since a = -d < 0), so each term is positive: d > 0 and (3d\u00b2)/4 > 0. Therefore, their sum is positive, which contradicts the inequality. Therefore, our assumption that a < 0 leads to a contradiction. Therefore, a must be \u2265 0. So 0 \u2264 a.\n\nThat's a good start. So a is non-negative. Now, the upper bound for a is 1/3. Let's see why. Since a \u2264 b \u2264 c, and all are non-negative, then the maximum a can be is when a is as large as possible, but still less than or equal to b and c, and the sum is 2. Let's try to find the maximum possible a.\n\nSuppose a is maximum. Then, since a \u2264 b \u2264 c, we can assume a = b \u2264 c. Let's set a = b. Then, since a + a + c = 2 \u2192 c = 2 - 2a. Then, the product ab + bc + ca = a\u00b2 + a(2 - 2a) + a(2 - 2a) = a\u00b2 + 2a(2 - 2a) = a\u00b2 + 4a - 4a\u00b2 = -3a\u00b2 +4a. This must equal 1.\n\nSo -3a\u00b2 +4a = 1 \u2192 3a\u00b2 -4a +1 =0. Solving quadratic equation: a = [4 \u00b1 sqrt(16 -12)] /6 = [4 \u00b12]/6 \u2192 (4+2)/6=1 or (4-2)/6=1/3. So a=1 or a=1/3. But if a=1, then c=2-2a=0, but since a \u2264 b \u2264 c, and a=1, then c=0 would be less than a, which contradicts a \u2264 c. Therefore, a=1 is invalid. So the valid solution is a=1/3. Then c=2-2*(1/3)=4/3. So when a=1/3, b=1/3, c=4/3. This satisfies a \u2264 b \u2264 c. Therefore, the maximum possible a is 1/3. Hence, a \u22641/3.\n\nTherefore, 0 \u2264 a \u22641/3.\n\nNow for b. The bounds are 1/3 \u2264 b \u22641. Let's see. Since a \u2264 b \u2264 c, and a \u22650, then b is at least a, which is at least 0. But we need to show it's at least 1/3. Let's think. If a is maximum at 1/3, then b would be 1/3 as well. But if a is less than 1/3, then b could be larger. Wait, but how to find the lower bound for b.\n\nAlternatively, consider that since a + b + c =2 and ab + bc + ca=1. Let's express variables in terms of a. Let\u2019s set a as fixed. Then, b + c =2 -a, and bc=1 -a(b + c) =1 -a(2 -a). So bc=1 -2a +a\u00b2. Then, since b and c are roots of the equation x\u00b2 - (2 -a)x + (1 -2a +a\u00b2)=0. The discriminant must be non-negative: (2 -a)^2 -4*(1 -2a +a\u00b2) \u22650.\n\nCompute discriminant: 4 -4a +a\u00b2 -4 +8a -4a\u00b2 = (-3a\u00b2 +4a). So discriminant is -3a\u00b2 +4a \u22650 \u2192 a(4 -3a) \u22650. Since a \u22650, then 4 -3a \u22650 \u2192 a \u22644/3. Which is already satisfied since a \u22641/3. So the roots exist. Now, since b \u2264 c, then b = [ (2 -a) - sqrt(discriminant) ] /2 and c = [ (2 -a) + sqrt(discriminant) ] /2. But how does this help us find the bounds for b?\n\nAlternatively, since a \u2264 b \u2264 c, and a is between 0 and 1/3, maybe we can find the minimum possible value of b. Let's consider when b is minimized. Since a \u2264 b, the minimum b is when a is maximum, which is 1/3. So when a=1/3, then b=1/3. So the lower bound for b is 1/3. But if a is less than 1/3, then b could be larger than 1/3. Wait, but how do we know that b can't be less than 1/3 when a is less than 1/3?\n\nWait, suppose a is less than 1/3. Then, since a \u2264 b \u2264 c, and a is smaller, maybe b can be as small as a, but since a is less than 1/3, then b could be less than 1/3. But the problem states that 1/3 \u2264 b \u22641. So there must be a reason why b can't be less than 1/3 even when a is less than 1/3. Hmm, this suggests that my previous thought is incorrect. Let's think again.\n\nWait, maybe when a is less than 1/3, the constraints force b to be at least 1/3. Let's see. Let's take a=0. Then, b + c=2, and bc=1. So solving for b and c: they are roots of x\u00b2 -2x +1=0, which factors as (x-1)^2=0. So b=c=1. So in this case, b=1. So when a=0, b=1. So b is 1, which is above 1/3. If a is 1/3, then b=1/3. So maybe as a increases from 0 to 1/3, b decreases from 1 to 1/3. Therefore, the minimum value of b is 1/3, achieved when a=1/3. Hence, b \u22651/3.\n\nSimilarly, the upper bound for b is 1. Let's see. When is b maximized? Since b \u2264 c, and a \u2264 b, the maximum b occurs when b is as large as possible. Let's suppose that b=c. Then, since a \u2264 b =c, and a +2b=2 \u2192 a=2-2b. Then, ab + bc + ca = a b + b\u00b2 + a b = 2ab + b\u00b2. Substitute a=2-2b:\n\n2*(2-2b)*b + b\u00b2 = (4b -4b\u00b2) + b\u00b2 =4b -3b\u00b2. This must equal 1.\n\nSo 4b -3b\u00b2 =1 \u2192 3b\u00b2 -4b +1=0. Solving: b=(4\u00b1sqrt(16-12))/6=(4\u00b12)/6 \u2192 b=1 or 1/3. If b=1, then a=2-2*1=0. So a=0, b=c=1. This is valid. If b=1/3, then a=2-2*(1/3)=4/3 -2= -2/3. But a must be \u2264 b=1/3, and here a=4/3 -2= 2 - 2*(1/3)= 2 - 2/3=4/3? Wait, wait, a=2-2b. If b=1/3, then a=2-2*(1/3)=2 - 2/3=4/3. But then a=4/3, which is greater than b=1/3, contradicting a \u2264 b. Therefore, the solution b=1/3 is invalid. So the only valid solution is b=1. Therefore, when b is maximized, it's 1. Hence, b \u22641.\n\nTherefore, the bounds for b are 1/3 \u2264b \u22641.\n\nNow for c. The bounds are 1 \u2264c \u22644/3. Let's see. Since c is the largest, and a + b + c=2, with a and b at least 0 and 1/3 respectively, the minimum c can be is when a and b are as large as possible. Wait, but a is at most 1/3, and b is at most 1. So the minimum c would be when a=1/3, b=1/3, then c=2 -1/3 -1/3=4/3. Wait, but that's the upper bound for c. Wait, no. Wait, if a and b are as large as possible, then c is minimized. But a is maximum at 1/3, and b is maximum at 1. So if a=1/3 and b=1, then c=2 -1/3 -1=2 -4/3=2/3. But this contradicts c \u2265b=1. So that's impossible. Therefore, the minimum c must be when a and b are as small as possible. Wait, but a is at least 0, and b is at least 1/3. So the minimum c is when a=0 and b=1/3. Then c=2 -0 -1/3=5/3\u22481.666, which is larger than 1. But the problem states that c \u22651. Let's check when c is minimized.\n\nWait, perhaps when a and b are as large as possible. Wait, but a can't exceed 1/3, and b can't exceed 1. Let's take a=1/3 and b=1. Then c=2 -1/3 -1=2/3, but this is less than b=1, which contradicts c \u2265b. Therefore, this is impossible. So the minimum c must be when a and b are arranged such that c is as small as possible while maintaining a \u2264b \u2264c.\n\nLet's consider the case when a=0. Then, as before, b +c=2 and bc=1. The solutions are b=1 and c=1. So c=1. So when a=0, c=1. But since a \u2264b \u2264c, and a=0, then b=1 and c=1. So c=1 is possible. Therefore, the minimum c is 1.\n\nNow, the maximum c. When is c maximized? When a and b are as small as possible. Since a \u22650 and b \u22651/3, the smallest a and b can be is a=0 and b=1/3. Then c=2 -0 -1/3=5/3\u22481.666. But the problem states c \u22644/3\u22481.333. Wait, this contradicts. So there must be an error here.\n\nWait, let's check. If a=0 and b=1/3, then c=2 -0 -1/3=5/3. But according to the problem, c should be \u22644/3. So this suggests a mistake in my reasoning. Let's see why.\n\nWait, but if a=0 and b=1/3, then ab + bc + ca=0 + (1/3)c +0= (1/3)c. But we know ab + bc + ca=1. So (1/3)c=1 \u2192 c=3. But c=3 would mean a + b",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the remainder when 194 is divided by 11, and show that it's 7. Hmm, let's see. I remember that when you divide a number by another, the remainder is what's left after subtracting multiples of the divisor. So, 194 divided by 11. Maybe I can start by figuring out how many times 11 fits into 194.\n\nLet me try multiplying 11 by some numbers to get close to 194. 11 times 10 is 110. 11 times 15 is 165. 11 times 17 is 187. Oh, 17 times 11 is 187. Then 194 minus 187 is 7. So the remainder should be 7. Wait, does that make sense?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a quicker way using modular arithmetic. Like, breaking down 194 into parts that are easier to handle modulo 11. For example, 194 can be written as 11*17 + 7, right? So when you divide 194 by 11, the quotient is 17 and the remainder is 7. That seems straightforward.\n\nBut maybe I should check using another method to be sure. Like, using the property that (a + b) mod m = [(a mod m) + (b mod m)] mod m. Let's see. 194 is 100 + 90 + 4. Let's compute each part modulo 11.\n\n100 divided by 11 is 9 with a remainder of 1, because 11*9=99, so 100-99=1. So 100 mod 11 is 1.\n\n90 divided by 11 is 8*11=88, so 90-88=2. So 90 mod 11 is 2.\n\n4 mod 11 is just 4, since 4 is less than 11.\n\nAdding those up: 1 + 2 + 4 = 7. Then 7 mod 11 is still 7. So that confirms the remainder is 7.\n\nWait, but maybe I should explain why breaking it into parts works. Because when you take each part modulo 11 and add them, the sum modulo 11 is the same as the original number modulo 11. That's a property of modular arithmetic. So by breaking 194 into 100 + 90 + 4, and finding each part's remainder, adding them gives the total remainder.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the fact that 10 \u2261 -1 mod 11. Because 10 + 1 = 11, which is 0 mod 11. So 10 \u2261 -1 mod 11. Then, 194 in decimal is 1*10^2 + 9*10^1 + 4*10^0. Using the congruence 10 \u2261 -1, we can substitute:\n\n1*(-1)^2 + 9*(-1)^1 + 4*(-1)^0 = 1*1 + 9*(-1) + 4*1 = 1 -9 +4 = -4. But -4 mod 11 is the same as 7 mod 11 because -4 + 11 =7. So that also gives 7 as the remainder. That's another way to verify it.\n\nSo multiple methods lead to the same answer, which makes me confident that the remainder is indeed 7.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo determine the remainder of 194 when divided by 11, we can use modular arithmetic properties and direct computation. Here's a step-by-step explanation:\n\n**Method 1: Direct Division**  \n1. **Find the largest multiple of 11 less than or equal to 194**:  \n   - \\(11 \\times 17 = 187\\)  \n   - Subtract this from 194: \\(194 - 187 = 7\\).  \n   - Thus, \\(194 = 11 \\times 17 + 7\\), so the remainder is **7**.\n\n**Method 2: Modular Breakdown**  \nBreak 194 into components and compute each modulo 11:  \n1. \\(194 = 100 + 90 + 4\\).  \n2. Compute each part:  \n   - \\(100 \\div 11 = 9\\) with remainder \\(1\\) \u2192 \\(100 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}\\).  \n   - \\(90 \\div 11 = 8\\) with remainder \\(2\\) \u2192 \\(90 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{11}\\).  \n   - \\(4 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{11}\\) (since \\(4 < 11\\)).  \n3. Sum the remainders: \\(1 + 2 + 4 = 7\\).  \n   - \\(194 \\equiv 7 \\pmod{11}\\).\n\n**Method 3: Digit-Based Congruence**  \nUse the fact that \\(10 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{11}\\):  \n1. Express 194 as \\(1 \\times 10^2 + 9 \\times 10^1 + 4 \\times 10^0\\).  \n2. Substitute \\(10 \\equiv -1\\):  \n   - \\(1 \\times (-1)^2 + 9 \\times (-1)^1 + 4 \\times (-1)^0 = 1 - 9 + 4 = -4\\).  \n3. Adjust negative result: \\(-4 \\equiv 7 \\pmod{11}\\) (since \\(-4 + 11 = 7\\)).\n\n**Conclusion**  \nAll methods confirm that the remainder of \\(194 \\div 11\\) is **7**.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem: How many integer values of x satisfy |x| < 3\u03c0? The options are given, and we need to show that the answer is (D) 19.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the inequality |x| < 3\u03c0 means. The absolute value inequality |x| < a, where a is a positive number, translates to x being between -a and a. So in this case, x must be greater than -3\u03c0 and less than 3\u03c0. So x is in the interval (-3\u03c0, 3\u03c0). Since x has to be an integer, we need to find all integers within this interval.\n\nNext, I should figure out the numerical value of 3\u03c0 to determine the bounds. From the context provided, \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535... So multiplying that by 3 gives 3\u03c0 \u2248 9.42477796077. So the interval for x is from -9.424... to 9.424.... Since x must be an integer, we need to list all integers greater than -9.424... and less than 9.424....\n\nNow, let's break it down. The lower bound is -9.424..., so the smallest integer greater than this is -9 (since -10 would be -10, which is less than -9.424...). Similarly, the upper bound is 9.424..., so the largest integer less than this is 9. Therefore, the integers x that satisfy the inequality are from -9 up to 9 inclusive.\n\nBut wait, I need to check if the endpoints are included. The inequality is strict (less than, not less than or equal to), so x must be strictly less than 9.424... and strictly greater than -9.424.... However, since 9.424... is not an integer, the largest integer less than 9.424... is 9, and the smallest integer greater than -9.424... is -9. So even though the inequality is strict, the integers at -9 and 9 are still included because they are within the bounds. For example, 9 is less than 9.424..., so it's included. Similarly, -9 is greater than -9.424..., so it's included.\n\nNow, let's count the integers from -9 to 9 inclusive. To find the number of integers in this range, we can calculate the total. The integers are: -9, -8, -7, ..., -1, 0, 1, ..., 7, 8, 9. \n\nHow many numbers is that? From -9 to 9, inclusive, there are 9 negative integers, 1 zero, and 9 positive integers. Wait, but that would be 9 + 1 + 9 = 19. Wait, no. Wait, from -9 to 9 inclusive, the count is (upper - lower + 1). So 9 - (-9) +1 = 19. Let me verify. Let's list them:\n\nNegative integers: -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1 (that's 9 numbers)\nZero: 0 (1 number)\nPositive integers: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 (9 numbers)\nTotal: 9 +1 +9 =19. Yes, that's 19 integers.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. If you have a range from a to b inclusive, the number of integers is b - a +1. Here, a is -9 and b is 9. So 9 - (-9) +1 = 9 +9 +1=19. Correct.\n\nTherefore, there are 19 integer values of x that satisfy |x| <3\u03c0. So the answer is D) 19.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure there's no mistake here. Let's confirm the value of 3\u03c0 again. Since \u03c0\u22483.1415926535, 3\u03c0\u22489.42477796077. So the upper bound is approximately 9.424, so the integers less than that are up to 9. Similarly, the lower bound is -9.424, so integers greater than that are starting from -9. So yes, integers from -9 to 9 inclusive. That's 19 integers. So the answer is D.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo determine how many integer values of \\( x \\) satisfy \\( |x| < 3\\pi \\), we start by interpreting the inequality. The absolute value \\( |x| < 3\\pi \\) means \\( x \\) lies in the interval \\( (-3\\pi, 3\\pi) \\). \n\nFirst, calculate \\( 3\\pi \\).

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to prove that for positive real numbers a and b, and a positive integer n, the inequality ( (a + b)/2 )^n \u2264 (a^n + b^n)/2 holds. Hmm. So, this looks like an inequality involving averages and exponents. Maybe I can relate this to some known inequality.\n\nFirst, I remember that Bernoulli's Inequality is about expressions like (1 + x)^n, but I'm not sure how that connects here. Wait, the context given includes a proof of Bernoulli's Inequality using a substitution y = 1 + x and splitting into cases where y is greater or less than 1. Maybe there's a similar substitution or case analysis here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe this is related to convexity. The function f(x) = x^n is convex for n \u2265 1 when x is positive because the second derivative is non-negative. If that's the case, then by Jensen's Inequality, the average of the function values is at least the function of the average. Wait, Jensen's Inequality states that for a convex function f, f( (a + b)/2 ) \u2264 (f(a) + f(b))/2. Wait, no, actually, for convex functions, it's the other way around. Wait, no, let me check. For convex functions, the inequality is f(\u03bbx + (1-\u03bb)y) \u2264 \u03bbf(x) + (1-\u03bb)f(y). So if f is convex, then the function at the average is less than or equal to the average of the function. That's exactly the inequality here. So if f(x) = x^n is convex on positive reals for n \u2265 1, then applying Jensen's with \u03bb = 1/2 gives the desired result. But maybe I need to verify that f is indeed convex.\n\nWait, the second derivative of f(x) = x^n is n(n-1)x^{n-2}. Since x is positive and n is a positive integer, if n \u2265 1, then for n \u2265 1, the second derivative is non-negative when n \u2265 1 (since if n=1, the second derivative is zero, and for n \u22652, it's positive). So f is convex for n \u22651. Therefore, by Jensen's Inequality, the inequality holds. But maybe the problem expects a proof without invoking Jensen's directly, perhaps using a more elementary approach like expanding or using induction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the inequality is a special case of the convexity argument. Let's think about expanding ( (a + b)/2 )^n and comparing it to (a^n + b^n)/2. For example, when n=1, both sides are equal. For n=2, ( (a + b)/2 )^2 = (a\u00b2 + 2ab + b\u00b2)/4, and (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)/2. The difference is (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)/2 - (a\u00b2 + 2ab + b\u00b2)/4 = (2a\u00b2 + 2b\u00b2 - a\u00b2 - 2ab - b\u00b2)/4 = (a\u00b2 - 2ab + b\u00b2)/4 = (a - b)^2 /4 \u22650. So it holds for n=2. For n=3, maybe similar expansion, but that could get messy. Induction might be a way. Suppose it's true for n=k, then show for n=k+1. But how?\n\nAlternatively, consider that the inequality can be rewritten as (a + b)^n \u2264 2^{n-1}(a^n + b^n). Maybe expanding the left side using the binomial theorem. The left side is sum_{k=0}^n C(n,k) a^{n-k} b^k. The right side is 2^{n-1}(a^n + b^n). So we need to show that sum_{k=0}^n C(n,k) a^{n-k} b^k \u2264 2^{n-1}(a^n + b^n). Let's see. For each term in the sum except a^n and b^n, which are C(n,0)a^n and C(n,n)b^n, the other terms are C(n,k)a^{n-k}b^k for k=1 to n-1. The sum of these terms would need to be \u2264 2^{n-1}(a^n + b^n) - (a^n + b^n) = (2^{n-1} -1)(a^n + b^n). Not sure if that's helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the AM-GM inequality. For example, for each term in the expansion, perhaps compare it to the average. Wait, but AM-GM gives that the geometric mean is less than or equal to the arithmetic mean. Not sure.\n\nWait, another approach: since the inequality is symmetric in a and b, maybe assume without loss of generality that a \u2265 b. Then set t = a/b \u22651, so the inequality becomes ( (t + 1)/2 )^n \u2264 (t^n +1)/2. Let me check this substitution. Let t = a/b, so a = tb. Then the left side is ( (tb + b)/2 )^n = (b(t +1)/2 )^n = b^n ( (t +1)/2 )^n. The right side is ( (tb)^n + b^n ) /2 = b^n (t^n +1)/2. So dividing both sides by b^n (since b >0), the inequality reduces to ( (t +1)/2 )^n \u2264 (t^n +1)/2. Now, this looks like a one-variable inequality in t \u22651. Maybe this is easier to handle. Let's denote f(t) = (t^n +1)/2 - ((t +1)/2)^n. We need to show f(t) \u22650 for t \u22651.\n\nTake t=1: f(1) = (1 +1)/2 - (2/2)^n = 1 -1 =0. So equality holds at t=1. Now check derivative or see if f(t) increases for t>1. Alternatively, maybe use induction on n. For n=1, equality holds. Suppose it's true for n=k, then for n=k+1, ( (t+1)/2 )^{k+1} = ( (t+1)/2 )^k * (t+1)/2. By induction hypothesis, ( (t+1)/2 )^k \u2264 (t^k +1)/2. So multiply both sides by (t+1)/2: ( (t+1)/2 )^{k+1} \u2264 (t^k +1)/2 * (t+1)/2. Now, need to show that (t^k +1)(t +1)/4 \u2264 (t^{k+1} +1)/2. Multiply both sides by 4: (t^k +1)(t +1) \u2264 2(t^{k+1} +1). Expand left side: t^{k+1} + t^k + t +1. Right side: 2t^{k+1} +2. Subtract left from right: 2t^{k+1} +2 - t^{k+1} - t^k - t -1 = t^{k+1} - t^k - t +1. Need to show this is \u22650. Factor: t^k(t -1) - (t -1) = (t -1)(t^k -1). Since t \u22651, t -1 \u22650, and t^k -1 \u22650 (since t \u22651 and k \u22651). So (t -1)(t^k -1) \u22650. Therefore, the difference is \u22650, so the inequality holds. Hence, by induction, the original inequality holds for all positive integers n.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use convexity as earlier. Since f(t) = t^n is convex for t>0 and n\u22651, then by Jensen's inequality, f( (a + b)/2 ) \u2264 (f(a) + f(b))/2. Which is exactly the inequality we need. So this gives a quick proof if we can cite Jensen's. But perhaps the problem expects a more elementary proof without invoking Jensen's, especially since the context given is Bernoulli's inequality, which uses a substitution and sum of geometric series.\n\nWait, the original problem's context includes a proof of Bernoulli's inequality that splits into cases based on whether y =1 +x is \u22651 or <1, and uses the sum of a geometric sequence. Maybe a similar approach can be used here. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the inequality can be transformed into something resembling Bernoulli's. Let me try to manipulate the given inequality. Let\u2019s set a and b as positive. Let\u2019s define x = a/b, so x >0. Then the inequality becomes ( (x +1)/2 )^n \u2264 (x^n +1)/2. Multiply both sides by 2: (x +1)^n \u2264 2^{n-1}(x^n +1). Wait, this seems similar to the earlier substitution approach. Alternatively, maybe expand (x +1)^n and compare term by term. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, use induction. For n=1, equality holds. Assume true for n=k. Then for n=k+1, ( (a + b)/2 )^{k+1} = ( (a + b)/2 )^k * (a + b)/2. By induction hypothesis, this is \u2264 (a^k + b^k)/2 * (a + b)/2. So need to show that (a^k + b^k)(a + b)/4 \u2264 (a^{k+1} + b^{k+1})/2. Multiply both sides by 4: (a^k + b^k)(a + b) \u2264 2(a^{k+1} + b^{k+1}). Expand left side: a^{k+1} + a^k b + b^k a + b^{k+1}. Right side: 2a^{k+1} + 2b^{k+1}. Subtract left from right: 2a^{k+1} + 2b^{k+1} - a^{k+1} - a^k b - b^k a - b^{k+1} = a^{k+1} + b^{k+1} - a^k b - a b^k. Factor: a^k(a - b) + b^k(b - a) = (a - b)(a^k - b^k). If a \u2265 b, then a - b \u22650 and a^k - b^k \u22650, so the product is \u22650. If a < b, then a - b <0 and a^k - b^k <0, so product is positive. Hence, the difference is \u22650, so the inequality holds. Therefore, by induction, the original inequality holds for all positive integers n.\n\nSo this induction approach works. Alternatively, the convexity argument via Jensen's is quicker, but maybe the problem expects induction or another method. The induction step uses the fact that (a^k + b^k)(a + b) \u2264 2(a^{k+1} + b^{k+1}), which simplifies to showing that a^k b + b^k a \u2264 a^{k+1} + b^{k+1}. Which can be rearranged as a^{k+1} + b^{k+1} - a^k b - a b^k \u22650, which factors as a^k(a - b) - b^k(a - b) = (a - b)(a^k - b^k). Then, as before, this is (a - b)^2 times a sum if k \u22651. Wait, but for k=1, (a - b)(a - b) = (a - b)^2 \u22650. For k>1, a^k - b^k = (a - b)(a^{k-1} + a^{k-2}b + ... + b^{k-1}), which has the same sign as a - b. So (a - b)(a^k - b^k) = (a - b)^2 (sum of positive terms) \u22650. Hence, the difference is non-negative, so the induction step holds.\n\nTherefore, the inequality holds by induction. Alternatively, using the substitution t = a/b and reducing to t \u22651, then using induction on n. Either way, the key steps are either applying Jensen's inequality (if allowed) or using mathematical induction with algebraic manipulation.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nLet's prove that for any two positive real numbers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), and any positive integer \\( n \\), the inequality  \n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{a + b}{2} \\right)^n \\leq \\frac{a^n + b^n}{2}\n\\]  \nholds.  \n\n**Step 1: Symmetry and Simplification**  \nFirst, observe that the inequality is symmetric in \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to show that there's a positive real number b such that f(x + b) = f(x) for all real x, given that f(x + a) = 1/2 + sqrt(f(x) - f(x)^2). Hmm. So the function f has this periodicity-like property with a shift of a, but it's not immediately obvious that it's periodic. The goal is to find a period b where shifting by b leaves the function unchanged.\n\nFirst, let's try to understand the given functional equation. For any real x, when we shift x by a, the value of f at x + a is 1/2 plus the square root of f(x) minus f(x) squared. Let me write that down: f(x + a) = 1/2 + sqrt(f(x) - [f(x)]\u00b2). \n\nWait, the expression under the square root is f(x) - [f(x)]\u00b2. Let's denote that as f(x)(1 - f(x)). So the square root term is sqrt(f(x)(1 - f(x))). That looks familiar. That's the same as the expression for the sine or cosine of an angle when you have something like sqrt(1 - t\u00b2), but here it's scaled. Maybe there's a trigonometric substitution here?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model f(x) as something squared. Suppose f(x) = [g(x)]\u00b2. Then f(x) - [f(x)]\u00b2 would be g(x)\u00b2 - g(x)^4. But that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe f(x) = sin\u00b2\u03b8(x), so that f(x)(1 - f(x)) = sin\u00b2\u03b8(x) cos\u00b2\u03b8(x), and the square root would be sin\u03b8(x) cos\u03b8(x). Then f(x + a) would be 1/2 + sin\u03b8(x) cos\u03b8(x). But 1/2 plus sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 is 1/2 + (1/2) sin(2\u03b8), which is 1/2 [1 + sin(2\u03b8)]. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's helpful yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe f(x) is related to a function with a known periodicity. Let's think about possible substitutions. Let's suppose that f(x) has some periodic behavior, and we need to find the period. Let's try to iterate the functional equation. Let's compute f(x + 2a). Using the given equation, f(x + 2a) = 1/2 + sqrt(f(x + a) - [f(x + a)]\u00b2). But f(x + a) itself is given by 1/2 + sqrt(f(x) - [f(x)]\u00b2). So substituting that in, we can compute f(x + 2a) in terms of f(x). Maybe after a few iterations, a pattern emerges that shows periodicity.\n\nLet me try that. Let's compute f(x + a) first. Let's denote f(x) as y. Then f(x + a) = 1/2 + sqrt(y - y\u00b2). Let's compute f(x + 2a) using the same formula. So f(x + 2a) = 1/2 + sqrt(f(x + a) - [f(x + a)]\u00b2). Let's compute the expression under the square root: f(x + a) - [f(x + a)]\u00b2. Let's substitute f(x + a) = 1/2 + sqrt(y - y\u00b2). Then:\n\nf(x + a) - [f(x + a)]\u00b2 = [1/2 + sqrt(y - y\u00b2)] - [1/2 + sqrt(y - y\u00b2)]\u00b2.\n\nLet's expand the square term: [1/2]^2 + 2*(1/2)*sqrt(y - y\u00b2) + [sqrt(y - y\u00b2)]\u00b2 = 1/4 + sqrt(y - y\u00b2) + (y - y\u00b2).\n\nSo the expression becomes:\n\n[1/2 + sqrt(y - y\u00b2)] - [1/4 + sqrt(y - y\u00b2) + y - y\u00b2]\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\n1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4\n\nsqrt(y - y\u00b2) - sqrt(y - y\u00b2) = 0\n\nThen - (y - y\u00b2) = -y + y\u00b2\n\nSo overall, f(x + a) - [f(x + a)]\u00b2 = 1/4 - y + y\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, f(x + 2a) = 1/2 + sqrt(1/4 - y + y\u00b2).\n\nNow, let's look at the expression under the square root: 1/4 - y + y\u00b2. Let's rearrange terms: y\u00b2 - y + 1/4. That's a quadratic in y. Let's factor it: y\u00b2 - y + 1/4 = (y - 1/2)^2. Because (y - 1/2)^2 = y\u00b2 - y + 1/4. Yes, exactly. So the expression under the square root is (y - 1/2)^2. Therefore, sqrt((y - 1/2)^2) is |y - 1/2|. But since we're dealing with real functions and square roots are non-negative, we take the non-negative root. So sqrt((y - 1/2)^2) = |y - 1/2|. However, since f(x) is a real function and the original equation requires that the expression under the square root is non-negative (because sqrt(f(x) - f(x)^2) must be real), we have that f(x) - [f(x)]\u00b2 \u2265 0. This implies that 0 \u2264 f(x) \u2264 1 for all x. So f(x) is between 0 and 1. Therefore, y = f(x) \u2208 [0,1]. Then y - 1/2 could be negative or positive. But when we take the square root, we get |y - 1/2|. However, in the original equation, f(x + a) = 1/2 + sqrt(f(x) - f(x)^2). Since sqrt(...) is non-negative, f(x + a) is at least 1/2. Wait, but if f(x) is between 0 and 1, then sqrt(f(x) - f(x)^2) is sqrt(f(x)(1 - f(x))), which is real. But f(x + a) = 1/2 + sqrt(f(x)(1 - f(x))). So f(x + a) is 1/2 plus a non-negative term, so f(x + a) \u2265 1/2. But since f(x) must be \u22641, then sqrt(f(x)(1 - f(x))) \u2264 sqrt(1/4) = 1/2, because the maximum of f(x)(1 - f(x)) is 1/4 when f(x)=1/2. Therefore, f(x + a) = 1/2 + something \u2264 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. So f(x + a) \u2208 [1/2, 1]. Similarly, when we compute f(x + 2a), we have f(x + 2a) = 1/2 + |y - 1/2|. But since y = f(x) \u2208 [0,1], then |y - 1/2| is either (1/2 - y) if y \u2264 1/2, or (y - 1/2) if y \u2265 1/2. Wait, but in the previous step, we found that f(x + a) \u2265 1/2, so when we compute f(x + 2a), the term inside the square root is (y - 1/2)^2 where y = f(x + a) \u2265 1/2. Therefore, |y - 1/2| = y - 1/2. So sqrt((y - 1/2)^2) = y - 1/2. Therefore, f(x + 2a) = 1/2 + (y - 1/2) = y. But y is f(x + a). Wait, no. Wait, let's clarify. Let me retrace.\n\nWait, when we computed f(x + 2a), we had:\n\nf(x + 2a) = 1/2 + sqrt(f(x + a) - [f(x + a)]\u00b2) = 1/2 + sqrt( (f(x + a) - [f(x + a)]\u00b2) )\n\nBut earlier, we found that f(x + a) - [f(x + a)]\u00b2 = (1/2 + sqrt(f(x) - f(x)^2)) - (1/2 + sqrt(f(x) - f(x)^2))\u00b2. Then after simplifying, we found that this equals (y - 1/2)^2 where y = f(x). Wait, no, let me check again. Wait, in the previous step, when we computed f(x + a) - [f(x + a)]\u00b2, we substituted y = f(x), and found that it equals (y - 1/2)^2. Wait, no, let's go back.\n\nWait, when we computed f(x + a) - [f(x + a)]\u00b2, we had:\n\nf(x + a) = 1/2 + sqrt(y - y\u00b2), where y = f(x).\n\nThen f(x + a) - [f(x + a)]\u00b2 = [1/2 + sqrt(y - y\u00b2)] - [1/2 + sqrt(y - y\u00b2)]\u00b2.\n\nExpanding the square:\n\n= 1/2 + sqrt(y - y\u00b2) - [ (1/2)^2 + 2*(1/2)*sqrt(y - y\u00b2) + (sqrt(y - y\u00b2))^2 ]\n\n= 1/2 + sqrt(y - y\u00b2) - [ 1/4 + sqrt(y - y\u00b2) + (y - y\u00b2) ]\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\n1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4\n\nsqrt(y - y\u00b2) - sqrt(y - y\u00b2) = 0\n\nThen - (y - y\u00b2) = -y + y\u00b2\n\nSo overall, f(x + a) - [f(x + a)]\u00b2 = 1/4 - y + y\u00b2 = y\u00b2 - y + 1/4 = (y - 1/2)^2.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(f(x + a) - [f(x + a)]\u00b2) = sqrt( (y - 1/2)^2 ) = |y - 1/2|.\n\nBut since y = f(x) \u2208 [0,1], then |y - 1/2| is either (1/2 - y) if y \u2264 1/2, or (y - 1/2) if y \u2265 1/2. However, from the previous step, f(x + a) = 1/2 + sqrt(y - y\u00b2). Since sqrt(y - y\u00b2) is non-negative, f(x + a) \u2265 1/2. Therefore, when we compute f(x + 2a), which is 1/2 + |y - 1/2| where y = f(x + a) \u2265 1/2, then |y - 1/2| = y - 1/2. Therefore, f(x + 2a) = 1/2 + (y - 1/2) = y. But y here is f(x + a). Wait, no. Wait, let's clarify variables.\n\nWait, let's re-express this step carefully. Let me denote z = f(x + a). Then f(x + 2a) = 1/2 + sqrt(z - z\u00b2). But earlier, we found that z - z\u00b2 = (y - 1/2)^2 where y = f(x). Wait, no. Wait, in the previous step, when we computed z - z\u00b2 where z = f(x + a) = 1/2 + sqrt(y - y\u00b2), we found that z - z\u00b2 = (y - 1/2)^2. Therefore, sqrt(z - z\u00b2) = |y - 1/2|. But since y = f(x) \u2208 [0,1], then |y - 1/2| could be either (1/2 - y) or (y - 1/2). However, when we compute f(x + 2a) = 1/2 + |y - 1/2|, this gives us two cases:\n\nCase 1: y \u2264 1/2. Then |y - 1/2| = 1/2 - y. So f(x + 2a) = 1/2 + (1/2 - y) = 1 - y.\n\nCase 2: y \u2265 1/2. Then |y - 1/2| = y - 1/2. So f(x + 2a) = 1/2 + (y - 1/2) = y.\n\nBut wait, but from the previous step, since z = f(x + a) = 1/2 + sqrt(y - y\u00b2), and since sqrt(y - y\u00b2) \u2265 0, then z \u2265 1/2. Therefore, when we compute f(x + 2a) = 1/2 + sqrt(z - z\u00b2), and since z \u2265 1/2, then z - z\u00b2 = z(1 - z). But z \u2265 1/2 and z \u2264 1 (since f(x) \u2208 [0,1]), so 1 - z \u2264 1/2. Therefore, z(1 - z) \u2264 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4. But earlier, we found that z - z\u00b2 = (y - 1/2)^2. Therefore, sqrt(z - z\u00b2) = |y - 1/2|. But since z = f(x + a) \u2265 1/2, and y = f(x), how does that relate?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let's try to track this step by step.\n\nGiven f(x + a) = 1/2 + sqrt(f(x) - [f(x)]\u00b2). Let's denote y = f(x). Then f(x + a) = 1/2 + sqrt(y - y\u00b2). Let's compute f(x + 2a):\n\nf(x + 2a) = 1/2 + sqrt(f(x + a) - [f(x + a)]\u00b2).\n\nBut f(x + a) = 1/2 + sqrt(y - y\u00b2). Let's compute f(x + a) - [f(x + a)]\u00b2:\n\nLet z = f(x + a) = 1/2 + sqrt(y - y\u00b2).\n\nThen z - z\u00b2 = (1/2 + sqrt(y - y\u00b2)) - (1/2 + sqrt(y - y\u00b2))\u00b2.\n\nExpanding the square:\n\n= 1/2 + sqrt(y - y\u00b2) - [ (1/2)^2 + 2*(1/2)*sqrt(y - y\u00b2) + (sqrt(y - y\u00b2))^2 ]\n\n= 1/2 + sqrt(y - y\u00b2) - [ 1/4 + sqrt(y - y\u00b2) + (y - y\u00b2) ]\n\nSimplify:\n\n1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4\n\nsqrt(y - y\u00b2) - sqrt(y - y\u00b2) = 0\n\nThen - (y - y\u00b2) = -y + y\u00b2\n\nSo overall, z - z\u00b2 = 1/4 - y + y\u00b2 = y\u00b2 - y + 1/4 = (y - 1/2)^2.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(z - z\u00b2) = sqrt( (y - 1/2)^2 ) = |y - 1/2|.\n\nThus, f(x + 2a) = 1/2 + |y - 1/2|.\n\nNow, since y = f(x) \u2208 [0,1], then |y - 1/2| is either (1/2 - y) if y \u2264 1/2, or (y - 1/2) if y \u2265 1/2.\n\nBut wait, from the expression for f(x + a), which is 1/2 + sqrt(y - y\u00b2), since sqrt(y - y\u00b2) is non-negative, f(x + a) \u2265 1/2. Therefore, when we compute f(x + 2a), which is 1/2 + |y - 1/2|, but y here is f(x), not f(x + a). Wait, no. Wait, in this case, y is f(x), and we're computing f(x + 2a) in terms of f(x). Wait, no, let's clarify:\n\nWait, in the expression f(x + 2a) = 1/2 + |y - 1/2|, where y = f(x). So this is in terms of f(x), not f(x + a). Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, no, let's retrace:\n\nWe have f(x + 2a) = 1/2 + sqrt(z - z\u00b2), where z = f(x + a) = 1/2 + sqrt(y - y\u00b2), and y = f(x).\n\nBut we found that z - z\u00b2 = (y - 1/2)^2, so sqrt(z - z\u00b2) = |y - 1/2|.\n\nTherefore, f(x + 2a) = 1/2 + |y - 1/2|, where y = f(x).\n\nAh, so f(x + 2a) depends on f(x), not directly on f(x + a). That's interesting. So f(x + 2a) = 1/2 + |f(x) - 1/2|.\n\nNow, let's analyze this. Let's consider two cases based on the value of f(x):\n\nCase 1: f(x) \u2264 1/2. Then |f(x) - 1/2| = 1/2 - f(x). Therefore, f(x + 2a) = 1/2 + (1/2 - f(x)) = 1 - f(x).\n\nCase 2: f(x) \u2265 1/2. Then |f(x) - 1/2| = f(x) - 1/2. Therefore, f(x + 2a) = 1/2 + (f(x) - 1/2) = f(x).\n\nSo in case 2, if f(x) \u2265 1/2, then f(x + 2a) = f(x). But in case 1, if f(x) \u2264 1/2, then f(x + 2a) = 1 - f(x).\n\nHmm. So this suggests that applying the shift twice (i.e., adding 2a) either leaves f(x) unchanged (if f(x",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to find ax^5 + by^5 given these equations. Hmm. The problem gives me a sequence of equations starting from ax + by up to ax^4 + by^4, and I need to find the next term, ax^5 + by^5. The answer is supposed to be 20, but I need to show how to get there.\n\nFirst, maybe there's a pattern or a recurrence relation here. Let me look at the given values: 3, 7, 16, 42. Let's call S1 = 3, S2 = 7, S3 = 16, S4 = 42, and we need S5 = ax^5 + by^5.\n\nLooking at the numbers: 3, 7, 16, 42. Let's see if there's a pattern between consecutive terms. From 3 to 7: difference is 4. Then 7 to 16: difference 9. 16 to 42: difference 26. Not obvious. Maybe ratios? 7/3 \u2248 2.33, 16/7 \u2248 2.29, 42/16 \u2248 2.625. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each term relates to previous terms through a linear recurrence. Let's assume that S_n = p*S_{n-1} + q*S_{n-2} for some constants p and q. Let's test this hypothesis.\n\nFor n=3: S3 = p*S2 + q*S1 \u2192 16 = 7p + 3q.\n\nFor n=4: S4 = p*S3 + q*S2 \u2192 42 = 16p + 7q.\n\nNow we have two equations:\n\n1) 7p + 3q = 16\n\n2) 16p + 7q = 42\n\nLet me solve this system. Multiply the first equation by 16 and the second by 7 to eliminate p:\n\n1) 112p + 48q = 256\n\n2) 112p + 49q = 294\n\nSubtract equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(112p +49q) - (112p +48q) = 294 -256 \u2192 q = 38.\n\nWait, that gives q=38. Then plug back into first equation: 7p +3*38=16 \u21927p=16-114= -98 \u2192 p= -14.\n\nBut let's check if this works for S4. If p=-14 and q=38, then S4 should be -14*16 +38*7 = -224 +266=42. That works. So the recurrence seems to be S_n = -14 S_{n-1} +38 S_{n-2}.\n\nWait, but let's check if this holds for S3. Using S3 = -14*S2 +38*S1 \u2192 -14*7 +38*3 = -98 +114=16. Yes, that works. So the recurrence is valid for S3 and S4. Then maybe this recurrence continues. So S5 would be -14*S4 +38*S3 = -14*42 +38*16 = -588 +608=20. So that's 20. Therefore, ax^5 + by^5 =20.\n\nBut wait, how do we know the recurrence continues? Maybe x and y satisfy a certain quadratic equation. Let's think. Suppose that x and y are roots of a quadratic equation t^2 - pt - q =0. Then, for each n \u22652, we have t^n = p t^{n-1} + q t^{n-2}. So, multiplying by a and b respectively and adding, we get ax^n + by^n = p(ax^{n-1} + by^{n-1}) + q(ax^{n-2} + by^{n-2}). So S_n = p S_{n-1} + q S_{n-2}. Which is exactly the recurrence we found. So if x and y are roots of t^2 - pt - q =0, then the recurrence holds. Here, we found p=-14 and q=38. So the quadratic equation would be t^2 +14t -38=0. But does this make sense? Let's check if x and y satisfy this equation. If they do, then the recurrence would hold for all n \u22652. But since we were able to derive the recurrence from S3 and S4, and it works for S3 and S4, then it's likely that this recurrence continues. Therefore, S5 would indeed be 20. So the answer is 20.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo find \\( ax^5 + by^5 \\), observe that the given equations form a sequence \\( S_n = ax^n + by^n \\) with known values:\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nS_1 &= 3, \\\\\nS_2 &= 7, \\\\\nS_3 &= 16, \\\\\nS_4 &= 42.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nWe hypothesize a **linear recurrence relation** connecting these terms.

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is to find the units digit of 29 times 79 plus 31 times 81, and show that it's 2. Hmm. Units digit, so the last digit of the result. I remember that when you multiply two numbers, the units digit of the product depends only on the units digits of the original numbers. Like, 23 times 45, the units digit is 3*5=15, so 5. Then add the two products here. So maybe I can find the units digit of each product first, then add them, and take the units digit of that sum.\n\nLet me break it down. First, 29 * 79. The units digits here are 9 and 9. 9*9 is 81, so the units digit of this product is 1. Then 31 * 81. The units digits are 1 and 1. 1*1 is 1, so the units digit here is also 1. Then adding those two results: 1 + 1 = 2. So the units digit of the total should be 2. That seems straightforward. But wait, maybe there's a carryover when adding the products? Like, if the products themselves have more digits, but when adding the two products, the units digits are 1 and 1, so adding them gives 2, no carryover. So the final units digit is 2. That makes sense. Let me check with actual numbers to be sure.\n\nCalculating 29*79: 29*80 is 2320, minus 29 is 2320-29=2291. So units digit is 1. Then 31*81: 30*80=2400, plus 1*80=80, plus 30*1=30, plus 1*1=1. Wait, maybe that's overcomplicating. Alternatively, 31*80=2480, plus 31*1=31, so 2480+31=2511. Units digit is 1. Then 2291 + 2511 = 4802. The units digit is 2. Yep, that checks out. So the method of taking the units digits of each product, multiplying them, then adding those units digits works here. So the answer is 2. I think that's solid. Maybe there's another way to see it, but this seems correct.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo determine the units digit of \\(29 \\cdot 79 + 31 \\cdot 81\\), we focus on the units digits of each term in the products, as the units digit of a product depends only on the units digits of the numbers being multiplied. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Units digit of \\(29 \\cdot 79\\):**\n   - The units digit of \\(29\\) is \\(9\\).\n   - The units digit of \\(79\\) is \\(9\\).\n   - Multiply these units digits: \\(9 \\cdot 9 = 81\\).\n   - The units digit of \\(81\\) is **1**.\n\n2. **Units digit of \\(31 \\cdot 81\\):**\n   - The units digit of \\(31\\) is \\(1\\).\n   - The units digit of \\(81\\) is \\(1\\).\n   - Multiply these units digits: \\(1 \\cdot 1 = 1\\).\n   - The units digit of \\(1\\) is **1**.\n\n3. **Add the results of the two products:**\n   - Add the units digits from the previous steps: \\(1 + 1 = 2\\).\n   - Since there are no carryovers (the sum \\(1 + 1\\) does not exceed \\(9\\)), the units digit of the total is **2**.\n\n**Verification:**  \nCalculating the actual products:\n- \\(29 \\cdot 79 = 2291\\) (units digit \\(1\\)),\n- \\(31 \\cdot 81 = 2511\\) (units digit \\(1\\)),\n- Sum: \\(2291 + 2511 = 4802\\) (units digit \\(2\\)).\n\nThus, the units digit of \\(29 \\cdot 79 + 31 \\cdot 81\\) is indeed **2**.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to prove that the square root of (log base 2 of 6 plus log base 3 of 6) is equal to the sum of the square roots of log base 2 of 3 and log base 3 of 2. Hmm, that's option D. Alright, let's start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, let's denote the expression inside the square root as S. So S = log\u20826 + log\u20836. The question is asking for \u221aS, and we need to show that this equals \u221a(log\u20823) + \u221a(log\u20832). \n\nI remember that logarithms can be manipulated using properties like change of base formula. Let me recall: log_b a = (ln a)/(ln b), right? Also, log_b (a*c) = log_b a + log_b c. Wait, but here we have log\u20826 and log\u20836. Let me break those down.\n\nLog base 2 of 6 can be written as log\u2082(2*3) = log\u20822 + log\u20823 = 1 + log\u20823. Similarly, log base 3 of 6 is log\u2083(3*2) = log\u20833 + log\u20832 = 1 + log\u20832. So adding them together, S = (1 + log\u20823) + (1 + log\u20832) = 2 + log\u20823 + log\u20832. \n\nSo now S = 2 + log\u20823 + log\u20832. The problem is to find \u221aS. The answer is supposed to be \u221a(log\u20823) + \u221a(log\u20832). Let's call that expression D. Let me square D to see if it equals S. \n\nLet D = \u221a(log\u20823) + \u221a(log\u20832). Then D\u00b2 = (\u221a(log\u20823))\u00b2 + 2*\u221a(log\u20823)*\u221a(log\u20832) + (\u221a(log\u20832))\u00b2 = log\u20823 + log\u20832 + 2*\u221a(log\u20823 * log\u20832). \n\nSo D\u00b2 = (log\u20823 + log\u20832) + 2\u221a(log\u20823 * log\u20832). But from earlier, S = 2 + log\u20823 + log\u20832. So if D\u00b2 equals S, then we must have that 2\u221a(log\u20823 * log\u20832) equals 2. That would mean \u221a(log\u20823 * log\u20832) = 1, so log\u20823 * log\u20832 = 1. Is that true?\n\nLet me check. Let's compute log\u20823 * log\u20832. Using the change of base formula, log\u20823 = (ln3)/(ln2) and log\u20832 = (ln2)/(ln3). Multiplying them together gives (ln3)/(ln2) * (ln2)/(ln3) = 1. So yes, their product is 1. Therefore, log\u20823 * log\u20832 = 1. \n\nTherefore, the cross term in D\u00b2 is 2*\u221a1 = 2. So D\u00b2 = (log\u20823 + log\u20832) + 2. But S is 2 + log\u20823 + log\u20832, which is the same as D\u00b2. Therefore, \u221aS = D. Hence, the answer is D. \n\nWait, let me verify again. S = 2 + log\u20823 + log\u20832. D\u00b2 = log\u20823 + log\u20832 + 2. So yes, S = D\u00b2. Therefore, \u221aS = D, which is \u221a(log\u20823) + \u221a(log\u20832). That's option D. \n\nSo the key steps were expanding the logs, recognizing the product of log\u20823 and log\u20832 is 1, which simplifies the square of the sum. That's clever. I think that's the right approach.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nLet's start by letting \\( S = \\log_2{6} + \\log_3{6} \\). We need to show that \\( \\sqrt{S} = \\sqrt{\\log_2{3}} + \\sqrt{\\log_3{2}} \\).\n\n**Step 1: Expand the logarithms**  \nFirst, break down \\( \\log_2{6} \\) and \\( \\log_3{6} \\) using properties of logarithms:  \n\\[\n\\log_2{6} = \\log_2{(2 \\cdot 3)} = \\log_2{2} + \\log_2{3} = 1 + \\log_2{3},\n\\]\n\\[\n\\log_3{6} = \\log_3{(3 \\cdot 2)} = \\log_3{3} + \\log_3{2} = 1 + \\log_3{2}.\n\\]\nAdding these gives:  \n\\[\nS = (1 + \\log_2{3}) + (1 + \\log_3{2}) = 2 + \\log_2{3} + \\log_3{2}.\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the proposed answer**  \nLet \\( D = \\sqrt{\\log_2{3}} + \\sqrt{\\log_3{2}} \\). To verify if \\( D = \\sqrt{S} \\), square \\( D \\):  \n\\[\nD^2 = \\left(\\sqrt{\\log_2{3}}\\right)^2 + 2\\sqrt{\\log_2{3} \\cdot \\log_3{2}} + \\left(\\sqrt{\\log_3{2}}\\right)^2.\n\\]\nSimplifying:  \n\\[\nD^2 = \\log_2{3} + \\log_3{2} + 2\\sqrt{\\log_2{3} \\cdot \\log_3{2}}.\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Simplify the cross term**  \nNotice that \\( \\log_2{3} \\cdot \\log_3{2} = 1 \\). This follows from the change-of-base formula:  \n\\[\n\\log_2{3} = \\frac{\\ln{3}}{\\ln{2}}, \\quad \\log_3{2} = \\frac{\\ln{2}}{\\ln{3}},\n\\]\nso their product is \\( \\frac{\\ln{3}}{\\ln{2}} \\cdot \\frac{\\ln{2}}{\\ln{3}} = 1 \\). Thus:  \n\\[\n2\\sqrt{\\log_2{3} \\cdot \\log_3{2}} = 2\\sqrt{1} = 2.\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Compare \\( D^2 \\) and \\( S \\)**  \nSubstituting back:  \n\\[\nD^2 = \\log_2{3} + \\log_3{2} + 2.\n\\]\nBut from Step 1, \\( S = 2 + \\log_2{3} + \\log_3{2} \\). Therefore:  \n\\[\nD^2 = S \\quad \\implies \\quad D = \\sqrt{S}.\n\\]\nThis confirms that \\( \\sqrt{\\log_2{6} + \\log_3{6}} = \\sqrt{\\log_2{3}} + \\sqrt{\\log_3{2}} \\), which matches option **(D)**. The key insight was recognizing the reciprocal relationship between \\( \\log_2{3} \\) and \\( \\log_3{2} \\), simplifying the cross term in the squared expression.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unsolved goals\n\u22a2 Real.log 3 * Real.log 2 ^ 3 + Real.log 3 ^ 2 * Real.log 2 ^ 2 * 2 + Real.log 3 ^ 3 * Real.log 2 =\n    Real.log 3 * Real.log 6 * \u221a(Real.log 2) ^ 2 * \u221a(Real.log 3) ^ 2 +\n      Real.log 2 * Real.log 6 * \u221a(Real.log 2) ^ 2 * \u221a(Real.log 3) ^ 2\n\ncase hx\n\u22a2 0 \u2264 Real.log 6 * (Real.log 2)\u207b\u00b9 + Real.log 6 * Real.log 2 * (Real.log 3)\u207b\u00b9 * (Real.log 2)\u207b\u00b9\n\ncase hy\n\u22a2 0 \u2264 Real.log 3 * (\u221a(Real.log 2))\u207b\u00b9 * (\u221a(Real.log 3))\u207b\u00b9 + Real.log 2 * (\u221a(Real.log 2))\u207b\u00b9 * (\u221a(Real.log 3))\u207b\u00b9\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unsolved goals\n\u22a2 Real.log 3 * Real.log 2 ^ 3 + Real.log 3 ^ 2 * Real.log 2 ^ 2 * 2 + Real.log 3 ^ 3 * Real.log 2 =\n    Real.log 3 * Real.log 6 * \u221a(Real.log 2) ^ 2 * \u221a(Real.log 3) ^ 2 +\n      Real.log 2 * Real.log 6 * \u221a(Real.log 2) ^ 2 * \u221a(Real.log 3) ^ 2\n\ncase hx\n\u22a2 0 \u2264 Real.log 6 * (Real.log 2)\u207b\u00b9 + Real.log 6 * Real.log 2 * (Real.log 3)\u207b\u00b9 * (Real.log 2)\u207b\u00b9\n\ncase hy\n\u22a2 0 \u2264 Real.log 3 * (\u221a(Real.log 2))\u207b\u00b9 * (\u221a(Real.log 3))\u207b\u00b9 + Real.log 2 * (\u221a(Real.log 2))\u207b\u00b9 * (\u221a(Real.log 3))\u207b\u00b9\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unsolved goals\n\u22a2 Real.log 3 * Real.log 2 ^ 3 + Real.log 3 ^ 2 * Real.log 2 ^ 2 * 2 + Real.log 3 ^ 3 * Real.log 2 =\n    Real.log 3 * Real.log 6 * \u221a(Real.log 2) ^ 2 * \u221a(Real.log 3) ^ 2 +\n      Real.log 2 * Real.log 6 * \u221a(Real.log 2) ^ 2 * \u221a(Real.log 3) ^ 2\n\ncase hx\n\u22a2 0 \u2264 Real.log 6 * (Real.log 2)\u207b\u00b9 + Real.log 6 * Real.log 2 * (Real.log 3)\u207b\u00b9 * (Real.log 2)\u207b\u00b9\n\ncase hy\n\u22a2 0 \u2264 Real.log 3 * (\u221a(Real.log 2))\u207b\u00b9 * (\u221a(Real.log 3))\u207b\u00b9 + Real.log 2 * (\u221a(Real.log 2))\u207b\u00b9 * (\u221a(Real.log 3))\u207b\u00b9\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. We need to find how many values of \u03b8 in the interval (0, 2\u03c0] satisfy the equation 1 - 3 sin\u03b8 + 5 cos3\u03b8 = 0. The answer is supposed to be 6, option D. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the equation given is 1 - 3 sin\u03b8 + 5 cos3\u03b8 = 0. I need to solve for \u03b8 here. Let's see if I can rewrite this equation in a way that's easier to handle. Maybe express everything in terms of cos3\u03b8 and sin\u03b8, but I'm not sure yet. Alternatively, perhaps using trigonometric identities to simplify.\n\nWait, the context provided includes a theorem about 2 cos3\u03b8 + 1 being factorized into a product involving cos\u03b8 minus cosines of certain angles. The theorem states that 2 cos3\u03b8 + 1 equals (cos\u03b8 - cos(2\u03c0/9))(cos\u03b8 - cos(4\u03c0/9))(cos\u03b8 - cos(8\u03c0/9)). That factorization might be useful here. Let me check how.\n\nLooking at the given equation: 1 - 3 sin\u03b8 + 5 cos3\u03b8 = 0. Let's rearrange terms to isolate the cosine term. Let's move the 1 and the sine term to the other side:\n\n5 cos3\u03b8 = 3 sin\u03b8 - 1\n\nHmm, but how does this relate to the theorem? The theorem involves 2 cos3\u03b8 + 1. Let me see if I can manipulate the equation to resemble that form. Let's try:\n\nStarting from 5 cos3\u03b8 = 3 sin\u03b8 - 1\n\nDivide both sides by 5:\n\ncos3\u03b8 = (3/5) sin\u03b8 - 1/5\n\nBut this doesn't immediately look like the expression in the theorem. Alternatively, maybe express the entire equation in terms of cos3\u03b8 and then use the factorization.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express sin\u03b8 in terms of cos3\u03b8. But that might not be straightforward. Let's think differently.\n\nThe theorem's expression is 2 cos3\u03b8 + 1 = product of three terms. Our equation has 5 cos3\u03b8. Let's see if we can relate 5 cos3\u03b8 to the left-hand side of the theorem. Let's see:\n\nIf 2 cos3\u03b8 + 1 is equal to that product, then maybe solving for cos3\u03b8 in terms of the product. But how does that help with the equation given?\n\nAlternatively, maybe substitute the factorization into the equation. Let's see:\n\nFrom the theorem, 2 cos3\u03b8 + 1 = (cos\u03b8 - cos(2\u03c0/9))(cos\u03b8 - cos(4\u03c0/9))(cos\u03b8 - cos(8\u03c0/9)). Therefore, cos3\u03b8 can be expressed as [ (cos\u03b8 - cos(2\u03c0/9))(cos\u03b8 - cos(4\u03c0/9))(cos\u03b8 - cos(8\u03c0/9)) - 1 ] / 2. But substituting that into the original equation might complicate things. Maybe not the best approach.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider rearranging the original equation to involve 2 cos3\u03b8 + 1. Let's see:\n\nOriginal equation: 1 - 3 sin\u03b8 + 5 cos3\u03b8 = 0\n\nLet's rearrange:\n\n5 cos3\u03b8 = 3 sin\u03b8 - 1\n\nDivide both sides by 5:\n\ncos3\u03b8 = (3/5) sin\u03b8 - 1/5\n\nBut the theorem gives 2 cos3\u03b8 + 1 as a product. Let's see if we can manipulate the equation to get 2 cos3\u03b8 + 1. Let's try:\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n2 cos3\u03b8 = (6/5) sin\u03b8 - 2/5\n\nThen add 1:\n\n2 cos3\u03b8 + 1 = (6/5) sin\u03b8 + 3/5\n\nBut this gives 2 cos3\u03b8 + 1 = (6 sin\u03b8 + 3)/5. Then, according to the theorem, the left side is the product of three terms. So:\n\n(6 sin\u03b8 + 3)/5 = (cos\u03b8 - cos(2\u03c0/9))(cos\u03b8 - cos(4\u03c0/9))(cos\u03b8 - cos(8\u03c0/9))\n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider substituting x = cos\u03b8. Then, using the triple angle formula for cosine: cos3\u03b8 = 4x\u00b3 - 3x. But wait, the theorem uses 2 cos3\u03b8 + 1, which would be 2(4x\u00b3 - 3x) + 1 = 8x\u00b3 - 6x + 1. The theorem states that this equals (x - cos(2\u03c0/9))(x - cos(4\u03c0/9))(x - cos(8\u03c0/9)). So, the equation 8x\u00b3 - 6x + 1 = (x - a)(x - b)(x - c), where a, b, c are the cosines of those angles. That's a cubic equation. So, the roots of 8x\u00b3 - 6x + 1 = 0 are x = cos(2\u03c0/9), cos(4\u03c0/9), cos(8\u03c0/9). Interesting.\n\nBut how does this relate to our original equation? Let's see. Our original equation is 1 - 3 sin\u03b8 + 5 cos3\u03b8 = 0. Let's try to express this in terms of x = cos\u03b8 and maybe y = sin\u03b8. But we know that x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 1. Let's see:\n\nOriginal equation: 1 - 3y + 5 cos3\u03b8 = 0\n\nBut cos3\u03b8 = 4x\u00b3 - 3x. So substituting:\n\n1 - 3y + 5(4x\u00b3 - 3x) = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\n1 - 3y + 20x\u00b3 - 15x = 0\n\nRearranged:\n\n20x\u00b3 -15x +1 -3y =0\n\nBut we have two variables here, x and y, related by x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =1. This might be tricky. Let's see if we can express y in terms of x from the equation:\n\nFrom 20x\u00b3 -15x +1 -3y =0:\n\n3y = 20x\u00b3 -15x +1\n\nSo y = (20x\u00b3 -15x +1)/3\n\nBut since y = sin\u03b8 and x = cos\u03b8, we have:\n\nsin\u03b8 = (20x\u00b3 -15x +1)/3\n\nBut x = cos\u03b8, so we can write:\n\nsin\u03b8 = (20 cos\u00b3\u03b8 -15 cos\u03b8 +1)/3\n\nNow, using the Pythagorean identity sin\u00b2\u03b8 + cos\u00b2\u03b8 =1, we can square both sides:\n\n[ (20x\u00b3 -15x +1)/3 ]\u00b2 + x\u00b2 =1\n\nThis would give a complicated equation in x. Expanding this might lead to a higher-degree polynomial. Let's check:\n\nLet me denote x = cos\u03b8 for simplicity.\n\nThen, the equation becomes:\n\n[ (20x\u00b3 -15x +1)/3 ]\u00b2 + x\u00b2 =1\n\nMultiply through by 9 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n(20x\u00b3 -15x +1)\u00b2 +9x\u00b2 =9\n\nExpand (20x\u00b3 -15x +1)\u00b2:\n\nFirst, let's compute (a + b + c)\u00b2 where a=20x\u00b3, b=-15x, c=1.\n\n= (20x\u00b3)^2 + (-15x)^2 +1^2 + 2*(20x\u00b3*(-15x) +20x\u00b3*1 + (-15x)*1)\n\n= 400x^6 + 225x\u00b2 +1 + 2*(-300x^4 +20x\u00b3 -15x)\n\n= 400x^6 +225x\u00b2 +1 -600x^4 +40x\u00b3 -30x\n\nSo, the entire left side becomes:\n\n400x^6 -600x^4 +40x\u00b3 +225x\u00b2 -30x +1 +9x\u00b2 =9\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n400x^6 -600x^4 +40x\u00b3 + (225x\u00b2 +9x\u00b2) -30x +1 =9\n\nWhich is:\n\n400x^6 -600x^4 +40x\u00b3 +234x\u00b2 -30x +1 =9\n\nSubtract 9 from both sides:\n\n400x^6 -600x^4 +40x\u00b3 +234x\u00b2 -30x -8 =0\n\nThis is a 6th-degree polynomial in x. Solving this directly seems very difficult. There must be a smarter approach.\n\nWait, going back to the original equation: 1 -3 sin\u03b8 +5 cos3\u03b8 =0. Let's try to use the theorem provided. The theorem factorizes 2 cos3\u03b8 +1 into a product of three terms. Let's see if we can relate the original equation to this.\n\nLet me rearrange the original equation:\n\n5 cos3\u03b8 = 3 sin\u03b8 -1\n\nLet's express this as:\n\ncos3\u03b8 = (3 sin\u03b8 -1)/5\n\nBut from the theorem, 2 cos3\u03b8 +1 = product, so:\n\n2*( (3 sin\u03b8 -1)/5 ) +1 = product\n\nBut this gives (6 sin\u03b8 -2)/5 +1 = (6 sin\u03b8 -2 +5)/5 = (6 sin\u03b8 +3)/5 = product\n\nBut according to the theorem, 2 cos3\u03b8 +1 = product, so:\n\n(6 sin\u03b8 +3)/5 = (cos\u03b8 - cos(2\u03c0/9))(cos\u03b8 - cos(4\u03c0/9))(cos\u03b8 - cos(8\u03c0/9))\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe instead, let's consider substituting z = e^{i\u03b8} as in the context. The context used z = e^{i\u03b8} to derive the factorization. Let's see if we can use complex numbers here.\n\nGiven z = e^{i\u03b8}, then cos\u03b8 = (z + z^{-1})/2 and sin\u03b8 = (z - z^{-1})/(2i). Also, cos3\u03b8 = (z^3 + z^{-3})/2.\n\nLet's substitute these into the original equation:\n\n1 -3*( (z - z^{-1})/(2i) ) +5*( (z^3 + z^{-3})/2 ) =0\n\nMultiply through by 2i to eliminate denominators:\n\n2i*1 -3(z - z^{-1}) +5i(z^3 + z^{-3}) =0\n\nSimplify:\n\n2i -3z +3z^{-1} +5i z^3 +5i z^{-3} =0\n\nMultiply both sides by z^3 to eliminate negative exponents:\n\n2i z^3 -3z^4 +3z^2 +5i z^6 +5i =0\n\nRearranged:\n\n5i z^6 -3z^4 +2i z^3 +3z^2 +5i =0\n\nThis is a sixth-degree polynomial in z. Solving this would give the roots, which correspond to solutions \u03b8. Since it's a sixth-degree polynomial, there are up to 6 roots, but we need to check if they lie on the unit circle (since |z|=1) and correspond to distinct \u03b8 in (0,2\u03c0].\n\nBut this approach might be too involved. Let's think differently. The original equation is 1 -3 sin\u03b8 +5 cos3\u03b8 =0. Let's consider possible substitutions or transformations.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the equation as a combination of sine and cosine terms. Maybe we can write it in terms of multiple angles or use some identity to combine terms.\n\nBut 1 -3 sin\u03b8 +5 cos3\u03b8 is a mix of sin\u03b8 and cos3\u03b8. It's not straightforward to combine them. Let's think about the number of solutions. The answer is supposed to be 6. Why?\n\nThe equation involves cos3\u03b8, which has a period of 2\u03c0/3, so over 0 to 2\u03c0, we'd expect 3 periods, leading to more solutions. Similarly, sin\u03b8 has a period of 2\u03c0. The combination might lead to multiple intersections.\n\nAlternatively, consider the equation as 5 cos3\u03b8 = 3 sin\u03b8 -1. Let's analyze the left-hand side and right-hand side as functions of \u03b8 and see how many times they intersect.\n\nThe left-hand side, 5 cos3\u03b8, is a cosine function with amplitude 5 and period 2\u03c0/3. The right-hand side, 3 sin\u03b8 -1, is a sine function with amplitude 3, shifted down by 1. Let's sketch these mentally.\n\nThe function 5 cos3\u03b8 oscillates between -5 and 5, three times as fast as the standard cosine. The function 3 sin\u03b8 -1 oscillates between -4 and 2, once every 2\u03c0. The number of intersections between these two functions over 0 to 2\u03c0 would determine the number of solutions.\n\nBut how many times do they cross? For each period of cos3\u03b8 (which is 2\u03c0/3), there might be two intersections. Since there are three periods in 2\u03c0, that would give 3*2=6 intersections. Hence, 6 solutions. That matches the answer D.\n\nBut this is a heuristic argument. Let's try to make it more precise.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the equation 5 cos3\u03b8 = 3 sin\u03b8 -1 can be rewritten as:\n\n5 cos3\u03b8 +1 = 3 sin\u03b8\n\nNow, using the theorem from the context: 2 cos3\u03b8 +1 = product. Let's see if we can relate 5 cos3\u03b8 +1 to this.\n\nBut 5 cos3\u03b8 +1 = 5 cos3\u03b8 +1 = 5 cos3\u03b8 +1. The theorem's left-hand side is 2 cos3\u03b8 +1. If we factor out 2 cos3\u03b8 +1, maybe we can express 5 cos3\u03b8 +1 in terms of that.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that 5 cos3\u03b8 +1 = 2 cos3\u03b8 +1 +3 cos3\u03b8. But I don't see how that helps.\n\nWait, maybe we can use the factorization given in the theorem. The theorem says 2 cos3\u03b8 +1 factors into three terms. If we can express 5 cos3\u03b8 +1 in terms of that, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider substituting the factorization into the equation. From the theorem:\n\n2 cos3\u03b8 +1 = (cos\u03b8 - cos(2\u03c0/9))(cos\u03b8 - cos(4\u03c0/9))(cos\u03b8 - cos(8\u03c0/9))\n\nSo, cos3\u03b8 = [ (cos\u03b8 - cos(2\u03c0/9))(cos\u03b8 - cos(4\u03c0/9))(cos\u03b8 - cos(8\u03c0/9)) -1 ] / 2\n\nBut substituting this into 5 cos3\u03b8 +1 =3 sin\u03b8 would give:\n\n5*[ (product -1)/2 ] +1 =3 sin\u03b8\n\nWhich simplifies to (5/2)(product -1) +1 =3 sin\u03b8\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that the equation 5 cos3\u03b8 +1 =3 sin\u03b8 can be rewritten as:\n\n5 cos3\u03b8 =3 sin\u03b8 -1\n\nLet me square both sides to eliminate the sine and cosine terms. But this will introduce extraneous solutions, so we have to be careful.\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n25 cos\u00b23\u03b8 =9 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -6 sin\u03b8 +1\n\nUsing the identity sin\u00b2\u03b8 =1 -cos\u00b2\u03b8:\n\n25 cos\u00b23\u03b8 =9(1 -cos\u00b2\u03b8) -6 sin\u03b8 +1\n\n=9 -9 cos\u00b2\u03b8 -6 sin\u03b8 +1\n\n=10 -9 cos\u00b2\u03b8 -6 sin\u03b8\n\nNow, replace cos\u00b23\u03b8 using the triple angle identity. cos3\u03b8 =4 cos\u00b3\u03b8 -3 cos\u03b8. So cos\u00b23\u03b8 = (4 cos\u00b3\u03b8 -3 cos\u03b8)^2 =16 cos^6\u03b8 -24 cos^4\u03b8 +9 cos\u00b2\u03b8\n\nThus:\n\n25(16 cos^6\u03b8 -24 cos^4\u03b8 +9 cos\u00b2\u03b8) =10 -9 cos\u00b2\u03b8 -6 sin\u03b8\n\nExpand left side:\n\n400 cos^6\u03b8 -600 cos^4\u03b8 +225 cos\u00b2\u03b8 =10 -9 cos\u00b2\u03b8 -6 sin\u03b8\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n400 cos^6\u03b8 -600 cos^4\u03b8 +225 cos\u00b2\u03b8 -10 +9 cos\u00b2\u03b8 +6 sin\u03b8 =0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n400 cos^6\u03b8 -600 cos^4\u03b8 +234 cos\u00b2\u03b8 -10 +6 sin\u03b8 =0\n\nThis is a sixth-degree equation in cos\u03b8, but also includes sin\u03b8. This seems even more complicated than before. Squaring introduced higher-degree terms and didn't resolve the sin\u03b8 term. This approach might not be helpful.\n\nLet's think differently. Let's consider substituting t = \u03b8. Then, the equation is 1 -3 sint +5 cos3t =0. Let's consider solving this numerically or graphically. But since we need to find the number of solutions, maybe analyzing the functions' behavior.\n\nThe left-hand side is 5 cos3t -3 sint +1. Let's consider the function f(t) =5 cos3t -3 sint +1. We need to find the number of zeros of f(t) in (0,2\u03c0].\n\nThe function cos3t has a period of 2\u03c0/3, so over 0 to 2\u03c0, it completes 3 cycles. The function sint has a period of 2\u03c0. The combination of these two functions with different frequencies can lead to multiple intersections.\n\nLet's analyze the behavior of f(t). The term 5 cos3t oscillates between -5 and 5, three times as fast as the -3 sint term, which oscillates between -3 and 3. Adding 1 shifts the entire function up by 1. So, the total function f(t) =5 cos3t -3 sint +1 will oscillate between -5 -3 +1 = -7 and 5 +3 +1=9. But the actual maxima and minima might be different due to the combination of the two oscillations.\n\nTo find the number of times f(t) crosses zero, we can consider how many times the sum of these oscillations crosses zero. Since the two terms have different frequencies, their combination can lead to multiple crossings. Specifically, the high-frequency term (5 cos3t) can cause multiple oscillations within the interval, leading to multiple zeros.\n\nBut how many exactly? Let's consider the derivative to find maxima and minima, but that might be time-consuming. Alternatively, note that each period of the higher frequency term (cos3t) could intersect with the lower frequency term (-3 sint +1) twice. Since there are three periods of cos3t in 0 to 2\u03c0, this could lead to 3*2=6 zeros. Hence, 6 solutions. This matches the answer D.\n\nAlternatively, consider",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, we have a two-digit number \"AB\", which means it's 10*A + B. When we cube this number, we get 912,673. We need to find A + B and show that it's 16.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what the original number AB is. Since AB is a two-digit number, it ranges from 10 to 99. Cubing it gives 912,673. So, the cube root of 912,673 should be AB. Let me check that.\n\nLet me calculate the cube root of 912,673. To approximate, I know that 90^3 is 729,000 and 100^3 is 1,000,000. So, 912,673 is between 90^3 and 100^3. Let's try numbers in the high 90s. Let's see:\n\n97^3: 97*97=9409, then 9409*97. Let's compute that. 9409*90=846,810 and 9409*7=65,863. Adding those gives 846,810 + 65,863 = 912,673. Oh, wait! That's exactly the number we have. So 97^3 = 912,673. Therefore, AB is 97. So A is 9 and B is 7. Then A + B = 9 + 7 = 16. That's the answer.\n\nBut wait, let me verify this step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's compute 97^3 again. 97*97 is 9409. Then 9409*97. Let's break it down: 9409*100 = 940,900. Subtract 9409*3 = 28,227. So 940,900 - 28,227 = 912,673. Yes, that's correct. So the cube of 97 is indeed 912,673. Therefore, AB is 97, so A=9, B=7, and their sum is 16. That checks out.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this without computing the cube root directly. For example, using modular arithmetic to narrow down possible digits. Let's see. The cube ends with 3. So the units digit B must be such that B^3 ends with 3. Let's check cubes of digits 0-9:\n\n0^3=0, 1^3=1, 2^3=8, 3^3=27, 4^3=64, 5^3=125, 6^3=216, 7^3=343, 8^3=512, 9^3=729.\n\nLooking for a cube ending with 3. Only 7^3 ends with 3 (343). So B must be 7. Therefore, the number is A7. Then, the cube of A7 is 912,673. So we need to find A such that (10A +7)^3 = 912,673.\n\nLet's compute (10A +7)^3. Expanding this, it's 1000A^3 + 3*100A^2*7 + 3*10A*7^2 + 7^3. Simplify:\n\n1000A\u00b3 + 2100A\u00b2 + 1470A + 343.\n\nSet this equal to 912,673. Subtract 343: 912,673 - 343 = 912,330. So 1000A\u00b3 + 2100A\u00b2 + 1470A = 912,330.\n\nDivide both sides by 10: 100A\u00b3 + 210A\u00b2 + 147A = 91,233.\n\nNow, let's try possible values of A (digits 1-9). Let's test A=9:\n\n100*(9)^3 + 210*(9)^2 +147*9 = 100*729 + 210*81 + 1323 = 72,900 + 17,010 + 1,323 = 72,900 + 17,010 = 89,910 + 1,323 = 91,233. Exactly! So A=9. Therefore, the number is 97, and A+B=9+7=16.\n\nThis confirms the answer again. So both methods\u2014direct computation of the cube root and algebraic expansion\u2014lead to the same conclusion. Therefore, the sum A + B is indeed 16.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo solve the problem, we need to find the two-digit number \"AB\" (where A and B are digits) such that when cubed, it equals 912,673. Then, we must show that the sum of its digits A + B is 16.\n\nFirst, recognize that \"AB\" represents the number 10A + B. Since it's a two-digit number, A ranges from 1 to 9, and B ranges from 0 to 9. We start by approximating the cube root of 912,673. Observing that:\n- \\(90^3 = 729,000\\),\n- \\(100^3 = 1,000,000\\),\n\nthe cube root lies between 90 and 100. Testing values in this range, we find:\n- \\(97^3 = 912,673\\) (verified by direct calculation: \\(97 \\times 97 = 9,409\\), then \\(9,409 \\times 97 = 912,673\\)).\n\nThus, \"AB\" is 97, meaning \\(A = 9\\) and \\(B = 7\\). Their sum is \\(9 + 7 = 16\\).\n\nTo confirm further, analyze the units digit. Since \\(912,673\\) ends in 3, the units digit \\(B\\) must satisfy \\(B^3 \\equiv 3 \\mod 10\\). Only \\(B = 7\\) works (\\(7^3 = 343\\)). Substituting \\(B = 7\\) into \\((10A + 7)^3 = 912,673\\) and solving algebraically confirms \\(A = 9\\). Hence, \\(A + B = 16\\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown constant 'Nat.eq_of_pow_eq_pow_3'\ntactic 'apply' failed, failed to unify\n  ?a / ?b = ?d \u2227 ?a % ?b = ?c \u2194 ?c + ?b * ?d = ?a \u2227 ?c < ?b\nwith\n  a = 9 \u2227 b = 7\na b : \u2115\nh\u2080 : 1 \u2264 a \u2227 a \u2264 9 \u2227 b \u2264 9\nh\u2081 : (10 * a + b) ^ 3 = 912673\nh\u2082 h\u2087 : 10 * a + b = 97\n\u22a2 a = 9 \u2227 b = 7\nno goals to be solved\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown constant 'Nat.eq_of_pow_eq_pow_three'\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase a\na b : \u2115\nh\u2080 : 1 \u2264 a \u2227 a \u2264 9 \u2227 b \u2264 9\nh\u2081 : (10 * a + b) ^ 3 = 912673\nh\u2082 h\u2087 : 10 * a + b = 97\nh\u2089 : 10 * a \u2264 97\nh\u2081\u2080 : a \u2264 9\na\u271d : 90 > 10 * a\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nunsolved goals\na b : \u2115\nh\u2080 : 1 \u2264 a \u2227 a \u2264 9 \u2227 b \u2264 9\nh\u2081 : (10 * a + b) ^ 3 = 912673\nh\u2082 h\u2087 : 10 * a + b = 97\nh\u2088 : a = 9\nh\u2081\u2084 : 10 * 9 + b = 97\n\u22a2 10 * 9 + b = 97\nunsolved goals\na b : \u2115\nh\u2080 : 1 \u2264 a \u2227 a \u2264 9 \u2227 b \u2264 9\nh\u2081 : (10 * a + b) ^ 3 = 912673\nh\u2082 h\u2087 : 10 * a + b = 97\nh\u2088 : a = 9\nh\u2081\u2084 : 10 * a + b = 97\nh\u2081\u2085 : 10 * 9 + b = 97\n\u22a2 90 + b = 97\ntype mismatch\n  h\u2082\u2081\nhas type\n  9 + 7 = 16 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  a + b = 16 : Prop\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown constant 'Nat.eq_of_pow_eq_pow_three'\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  97\na b : \u2115\nh\u2080 : 1 \u2264 a \u2227 a \u2264 9 \u2227 b \u2264 9\nh\u2081 : (10 * a + b) ^ 3 = 912673\nh\u2082 : 10 * a + b = 97\nh\u2087 : 10 * a \u2264 97\nh\u2088 : a \u2264 9\n\u22a2 10 * a = 10 * 9\nno goals to be solved\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, we need to show that if a is an odd integer and b is a natural number divisible by 4, then a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 \u2261 1 mod 8. Hmm, let's start by recalling some properties of odd numbers and squares.\n\nFirst, since a is odd, I remember that the square of an odd number is always congruent to 1 modulo 8. Wait, is that right? Let me check. If a is odd, then a can be written as 2k + 1 for some integer k. Squaring that gives (2k+1)\u00b2 = 4k\u00b2 + 4k + 1 = 4k(k+1) + 1. Now, k and k+1 are consecutive integers, so one of them must be even. Therefore, 4k(k+1) is divisible by 8, because 4 multiplied by an even number (2m) is 8m. So, 4k(k+1) is a multiple of 8, and adding 1 gives a\u00b2 \u2261 1 mod 8. Got it, so a\u00b2 mod 8 is 1.\n\nNow, what about b? The problem states that 4 divides b, so b is a multiple of 4. Let's write b as 4m where m is a natural number. Then, b\u00b2 = (4m)\u00b2 = 16m\u00b2. Since 16 is 8*2, 16m\u00b2 is divisible by 8, so b\u00b2 \u2261 0 mod 8.\n\nPutting these together: a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 \u2261 1 + 0 \u2261 1 mod 8. That seems straightforward. Wait, but let me make sure there's no catch here. The key steps are:\n\n1. Express a as an odd integer, so a\u00b2 \u2261 1 mod 8.\n2. Express b as a multiple of 4, so b\u00b2 is a multiple of 16, hence 0 mod 8.\n3. Adding them gives 1 + 0 = 1 mod 8.\n\nBut maybe I should verify each step again. Let's take an example. Let a = 3 (odd), b = 4. Then a\u00b2 = 9, b\u00b2 = 16. 9 + 16 = 25. 25 divided by 8 is 3 with remainder 1, so 25 \u2261 1 mod 8. Another example: a = 5, b = 8. a\u00b2 = 25, b\u00b2 = 64. 25 + 64 = 89. 89 mod 8 is 1 (since 8*11=88, 89-88=1). Yep, works.\n\nBut wait, what if b is 0? Since 4 divides 0, but 0 is a natural number here? Wait, the problem says b is a natural number. Depending on the definition, natural numbers sometimes start at 1, sometimes include 0. If b is 0, then b\u00b2 = 0, and a\u00b2 + 0 \u2261 1 mod 8, which still holds. So even if b is 0, the statement is true. So regardless of the value of b as long as it's a multiple of 4, the square will be 0 mod 8.\n\nTherefore, the proof seems solid. The main points are the properties of squares of odd numbers and multiples of 4. The key insight is breaking down the components and using modular arithmetic properties.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nLet's start by analyzing each term in the expression \\( a^2 + b^2 \\) under the given conditions. \n\n1. **Odd integer \\( a \\):**  \n   Since \\( a \\) is odd, we can write \\( a = 2k + 1 \\) for some integer \\( k \\). Squaring this gives:\n   \\[\n   a^2 = (2k + 1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 = 4k(k + 1) + 1.\n   \\]\n   Notice that \\( k(k + 1) \\) is the product of two consecutive integers, so one of them must be even. This means \\( k(k + 1) \\) is divisible by \\( 2 \\), and thus \\( 4k(k + 1) \\) is divisible by \\( 8 \\). Therefore:\n   \\[\n   a^2 \\equiv 1 \\mod 8.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Natural number \\( b \\) divisible by 4:**  \n   If \\( 4 \\) divides \\( b \\), we can write \\( b = 4m \\) for some natural number \\( m \\).

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem says that the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers is 3720, and their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 8. One of the numbers is 120, and we need to find the other number, which should be 248. Hmm, how do I approach this?\n\nWait, I remember there's a relationship between the LCM and GCD of two numbers. Oh right! The product of the LCM and GCD of two numbers equals the product of the numbers themselves. So, if we call the two numbers a and b, then LCM(a, b) * GCD(a, b) = a * b. That formula might be useful here.\n\nLet me write that down: LCM(a, b) \u00d7 GCD(a, b) = a \u00d7 b. Here, one of the numbers is 120, let's say a = 120. We need to find b. We know LCM(120, b) = 3720 and GCD(120, b) = 8. So plugging into the formula: 3720 \u00d7 8 = 120 \u00d7 b. Then, solving for b would give b = (3720 \u00d7 8) / 120. Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, multiply 3720 by 8. Let's see: 3720 \u00d7 8. 3000 \u00d7 8 is 24,000. 720 \u00d7 8 is 5,760. Adding those together: 24,000 + 5,760 = 29,760. So 3720 \u00d7 8 = 29,760. Then divide that by 120. 29,760 \u00f7 120. Let's simplify. 29,760 divided by 120. Well, 120 \u00d7 200 is 24,000. Subtract that from 29,760: 29,760 - 24,000 = 5,760. Then 120 \u00d7 48 = 5,760. So 200 + 48 = 248. So b = 248. That checks out with the answer given.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should verify this using another method to be sure. Let's check if GCD(120, 248) is indeed 8 and LCM(120, 248) is 3720.\n\nFirst, find GCD(120, 248). Let's use the Euclidean algorithm. The GCD of 248 and 120. Divide 248 by 120: 120 \u00d7 2 = 240, remainder 8. So GCD(120, 248) = GCD(120, 8). Now, 120 divided by 8 is 15 with no remainder. So GCD is 8. That's correct.\n\nNow, LCM. Using the formula again: LCM(120, 248) = (120 \u00d7 248) / GCD(120, 248) = (120 \u00d7 248)/8. Let's compute that. 120 divided by 8 is 15. So 15 \u00d7 248 = 3,720. Yes, that's the given LCM. So both conditions are satisfied. Therefore, the other number is indeed 248.\n\nI think that's solid. The key was remembering the relationship between LCM and GCD. Maybe I should explain why that relationship holds, just to make the proof more complete. The formula works because when you take the product of the two numbers, you're accounting for all their prime factors. The GCD captures the common factors, and the LCM captures the maximum exponents of all primes present. So multiplying them gives the product of the numbers. That makes sense. So using that formula directly gives the answer here.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nAlright, let's tackle this step by step. We know two key things: the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers is 3720, their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 8, and one of the numbers is 120. We need to find the other number and confirm it\u2019s 248.\n\n**Step 1: Use the LCM-GCD relationship**  \nThere\u2019s a powerful formula connecting LCM and GCD:  \n\\[\n\\text{LCM}(a, b) \\times \\text{GCD}(a, b) = a \\times b\n\\]  \nThis works because the LCM captures the \"shared and unique\" prime factors of the numbers, while the GCD captures only the \"shared\" ones. Multiplying them reconstructs the full product of the original numbers.\n\n**Step 2: Plug in the known values**  \nLet\u2019s call the unknown number \\( x \\). We know:  \n- \\(\\text{LCM}(120, x) = 3720\\)  \n- \\(\\text{GCD}(120, x) = 8\\)  \n\nUsing the formula:  \n\\[\n3720 \\times 8 = 120 \\times x\n\\]  \nSimplify the left side:  \n\\[\n29,\\!760 = 120 \\times x\n\\]  \nNow solve for \\( x \\):  \n\\[\nx = \\frac{29,\\!760}{120} = 248\n\\]  \nSo \\( x = 248 \\). But let\u2019s verify this properly.\n\n**Step 3: Verify GCD(120, 248) = 8**  \nUse the Euclidean algorithm:  \n1. Divide 248 by 120:  \n   \\( 248 = 2 \\times 120 + 8 \\) (remainder 8).  \n2. Now find GCD(120, 8):  \n   \\( 120 = 15 \\times 8 + 0 \\).  \n   Since the remainder is 0, the GCD is **8**.  \nThis matches the given GCD.\n\n**Step 4: Verify LCM(120, 248) = 3720**  \nUsing the formula again:  \n\\[\n\\text{LCM}(120, 248) = \\frac{120 \\times 248}{\\text{GCD}(120, 248)} = \\frac{29,\\!760}{8} = 3,\\!720\n\\]  \nPerfect! The LCM matches too.\n\n**Conclusion**  \nBy leveraging the relationship between LCM and GCD, solving for \\( x \\), and verifying both conditions, we confirm the other number is **248**.\nPrevious attempt failed with: no goals to be solved\napplication type mismatch\n  Nat.eq_of_mul_eq_mul_left ?m.602 h\u2082\nargument\n  h\u2082\nhas type\n  b * 120 = 3720 * 8 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  b * 120 = b * ?m.600 : Prop\nunsolved goals\nb : \u2115\nh\u2080 : Nat.lcm 120 b = 3720\nh\u2081 : Nat.gcd 120 b = 8\nh\u2082 : b * 120 = 3720 * 8\n\u22a2 0 < b\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: no goals to be solved\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: no goals to be solved\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The problem states that the sum from k=1 to 35 of sin(5k) degrees equals tan(m/n), where m and n are coprime positive integers with m/n < 90, and we need to find m + n, which is supposed to be 177. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the sum of sines looks like. The sum is \u2211_{k=1}^{35} sin(5k\u00b0). Each term is sin(5\u00b0), sin(10\u00b0), sin(15\u00b0), ..., up to sin(175\u00b0), since 5*35 = 175. So this is an arithmetic sequence of angles with common difference 5\u00b0, starting at 5\u00b0 and ending at 175\u00b0, totaling 35 terms.\n\nI remember that there's a formula for the sum of sines of an arithmetic sequence. The general formula for \u2211_{k=0}^{N-1} sin(a + kd) is [sin(Nd/2) / sin(d/2)] * sin(a + (N-1)d/2). Let me verify that. Yes, the formula is:\n\nSum = [sin(Nd/2) / sin(d/2)] * sin(a + (N-1)d/2)\n\nIn our case, the first term is sin(5\u00b0), so a = 5\u00b0, the common difference d = 5\u00b0, and the number of terms N = 35. Wait, but the formula starts at k=0, so if our sum starts at k=1, maybe we need to adjust. Let me check. If the original formula is for k=0 to N-1, then to get from k=1 to 35, that's 35 terms, which would correspond to k=0 to 34 (which is 35 terms). So maybe we need to adjust the formula accordingly. Let me adjust the parameters.\n\nLet\u2019s set a = 5\u00b0, d = 5\u00b0, and N = 35. Then the sum would be from k=0 to 34 of sin(a + kd) = sin(5\u00b0 + 5\u00b0k) for k from 0 to 34. But our original sum is from k=1 to 35, which is sin(5\u00b0*k) where k=1 to 35. Wait, 5\u00b0*35 is 175\u00b0, so the last term is sin(175\u00b0). So actually, the sum from k=1 to 35 of sin(5k\u00b0) is the same as the sum from k=0 to 34 of sin(5\u00b0 + 5\u00b0k). So yes, the formula applies here with a = 5\u00b0, d = 5\u00b0, N = 35.\n\nApplying the formula:\n\nSum = [sin(Nd/2) / sin(d/2)] * sin(a + (N-1)d/2)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nNd/2 = 35*5\u00b0/2 = 175\u00b0/2 = 87.5\u00b0\n\nd/2 = 5\u00b0/2 = 2.5\u00b0\n\na + (N-1)d/2 = 5\u00b0 + (34)*5\u00b0/2 = 5\u00b0 + 170\u00b0/2 = 5\u00b0 + 85\u00b0 = 90\u00b0\n\nSo the sum becomes:\n\n[sin(87.5\u00b0) / sin(2.5\u00b0)] * sin(90\u00b0)\n\nBut sin(90\u00b0) is 1, so this simplifies to sin(87.5\u00b0) / sin(2.5\u00b0)\n\nNow, sin(87.5\u00b0) is equal to sin(90\u00b0 - 2.5\u00b0) = cos(2.5\u00b0), because sin(90\u00b0 - x) = cos(x). So we have:\n\nSum = cos(2.5\u00b0) / sin(2.5\u00b0) = cot(2.5\u00b0)\n\nBut cotangent is the reciprocal of tangent, so cot(2.5\u00b0) = 1 / tan(2.5\u00b0) = tan(90\u00b0 - 2.5\u00b0) = tan(87.5\u00b0)\n\nWait, because tan(90\u00b0 - x) = cot(x), so cot(x) = tan(90\u00b0 - x). Therefore, cot(2.5\u00b0) = tan(87.5\u00b0). Therefore, the sum is equal to tan(87.5\u00b0).\n\nBut the problem states that the sum equals tan(m/n), where m/n is less than 90\u00b0, and m and n are coprime. So 87.5\u00b0 is equal to 87.5 degrees, which is 87.5 = 175/2. So m = 175, n = 2. Are 175 and 2 coprime? Yes, since 175 is 5^2 *7 and 2 is prime. So m + n = 175 + 2 = 177, which matches the answer.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's go through again.\n\nFirst, the sum formula: \u2211_{k=1}^{N} sin(a + (k-1)d) = [sin(Nd/2)/sin(d/2)] * sin(a + (N-1)d/2). Wait, maybe I should check the exact formula again. Alternatively, another version of the formula is:\n\nSum_{k=1}^n sin(k\u03b8) = [sin(n\u03b8/2) * sin((n+1)\u03b8/2)] / sin(\u03b8/2)\n\nWait, perhaps I confused the formula. Let me confirm. The formula for the sum of sines with arithmetic progression:\n\nSum_{k=0}^{N-1} sin(a + kd) = [sin(Nd/2) / sin(d/2)] * sin(a + (N-1)d/2)\n\nYes, that's correct. So in our case, the sum from k=1 to 35 of sin(5k\u00b0) is equivalent to the sum from k=0 to 34 of sin(5\u00b0 + 5\u00b0k). Therefore, N = 35, a = 5\u00b0, d = 5\u00b0. Plugging into the formula:\n\nSum = [sin(35*5\u00b0/2) / sin(5\u00b0/2)] * sin(5\u00b0 + (35-1)*5\u00b0/2)\n\nCalculate each part:\n\n35*5\u00b0 = 175\u00b0, so 175\u00b0/2 = 87.5\u00b0, so sin(87.5\u00b0)\n\nDenominator: sin(5\u00b0/2) = sin(2.5\u00b0)\n\nSecond part: 5\u00b0 + 34*5\u00b0/2 = 5\u00b0 + 170\u00b0/2 = 5\u00b0 + 85\u00b0 = 90\u00b0, so sin(90\u00b0) = 1\n\nTherefore, Sum = sin(87.5\u00b0)/sin(2.5\u00b0) * 1 = sin(87.5\u00b0)/sin(2.5\u00b0)\n\nNow, sin(87.5\u00b0) = sin(90\u00b0 - 2.5\u00b0) = cos(2.5\u00b0), so the sum becomes cos(2.5\u00b0)/sin(2.5\u00b0) = cot(2.5\u00b0)\n\nBut cot(\u03b8) = 1/tan(\u03b8) = tan(90\u00b0 - \u03b8), so cot(2.5\u00b0) = tan(87.5\u00b0)\n\nTherefore, the sum equals tan(87.5\u00b0). Now, 87.5\u00b0 can be written as a fraction. Since 87.5 = 87 + 0.5 = 87.5 = 175/2 degrees. So m/n = 175/2, which is 87.5\u00b0, less than 90\u00b0, and 175 and 2 are coprime. Therefore, m = 175, n = 2, so m + n = 177.\n\nThis seems correct. Let me check if there's any alternative approach or possible mistake. For example, verifying the sum formula. Let's take a small case. Suppose N=2, sum sin(5\u00b0) + sin(10\u00b0). According to the formula:\n\nSum = [sin(2*5\u00b0/2)/sin(5\u00b0/2)] * sin(5\u00b0 + (2-1)*5\u00b0/2) = [sin(5\u00b0)/sin(2.5\u00b0)] * sin(5\u00b0 + 2.5\u00b0) = [sin(5\u00b0)/sin(2.5\u00b0)] * sin(7.5\u00b0)\n\nCalculate this:\n\nsin(5\u00b0) \u2248 0.08716\n\nsin(2.5\u00b0) \u2248 0.04368\n\nsin(7.5\u00b0) \u2248 0.13052\n\nSo [0.08716 / 0.04368] * 0.13052 \u2248 [1.995] * 0.13052 \u2248 0.2606\n\nDirect sum: sin(5\u00b0) + sin(10\u00b0) \u2248 0.08716 + 0.1736 \u2248 0.2607, which matches. So the formula works here. Therefore, the application to N=35 should be correct.\n\nAnother check: when we have the sum equal to tan(87.5\u00b0), which is a large value since tan(87.5\u00b0) is very large (since tan(90\u00b0) is undefined, approaching infinity). Let's see, the sum of 35 terms of sine values. Each term from sin(5\u00b0) up to sin(175\u00b0). The maximum term is sin(90\u00b0) = 1, but there are terms decreasing after that. However, the sum might accumulate to a large value. For example, if each term averages around 0.5, the sum would be around 17.5, but tan(87.5\u00b0) is indeed very large, which makes sense. For example, tan(87.5\u00b0) \u2248 tan(\u03c0/2 - 2.5\u00b0) \u2248 cot(2.5\u00b0) \u2248 1/tan(2.5\u00b0) \u2248 1/0.04368 \u2248 22.9. Let's compute the sum numerically to check.\n\nCompute the sum numerically:\n\nSum = \u2211_{k=1}^{35} sin(5k\u00b0)\n\nCompute using a calculator:\n\nLet me approximate a few terms:\n\nsin(5\u00b0) \u2248 0.08716\n\nsin(10\u00b0) \u2248 0.1736\n\nsin(15\u00b0) \u2248 0.2588\n\nsin(20\u00b0) \u2248 0.3420\n\nsin(25\u00b0) \u2248 0.4226\n\nsin(30\u00b0) \u2248 0.5\n\nsin(35\u00b0) \u2248 0.5736\n\nsin(40\u00b0) \u2248 0.6428\n\nsin(45\u00b0) \u2248 0.7071\n\nsin(50\u00b0) \u2248 0.7660\n\nsin(55\u00b0) \u2248 0.8192\n\nsin(60\u00b0) \u2248 0.8660\n\nsin(65\u00b0) \u2248 0.9063\n\nsin(70\u00b0) \u2248 0.9397\n\nsin(75\u00b0) \u2248 0.9659\n\nsin(80\u00b0) \u2248 0.9848\n\nsin(85\u00b0) \u2248 0.9962\n\nsin(90\u00b0) = 1\n\nThen from 95\u00b0 to 175\u00b0, the sine values start decreasing again, since sin(90\u00b0 + x) = sin(90\u00b0 - x), so sin(95\u00b0) = sin(85\u00b0) \u2248 0.9962, sin(100\u00b0) = sin(80\u00b0) \u2248 0.9848, and so on, down to sin(175\u00b0) = sin(5\u00b0) \u2248 0.08716.\n\nSo the sum is symmetric around 90\u00b0, meaning that the terms from 5\u00b0 to 85\u00b0 mirror those from 95\u00b0 to 175\u00b0. Therefore, the sum can be considered as 2*(sum from k=1 to 17 of sin(5k\u00b0)) + sin(90\u00b0). Wait, but 35 terms: 5\u00b0, 10\u00b0, ..., 175\u00b0. The middle term is the 18th term: 5*18=90\u00b0, so the 18th term is sin(90\u00b0)=1. Then the terms before and after are symmetric. So sum = 2*(sum from k=1 to 17 of sin(5k\u00b0)) + 1.\n\nBut maybe this approach complicates things. Alternatively, using the formula gives us tan(87.5\u00b0), which is approximately 22.9, and if we compute the sum numerically, it should be around that value. Let's check with a few terms:\n\nBut doing this manually would take time. Alternatively, trust the formula. Since the formula checks out for small N, and the logic follows, the conclusion that the sum is tan(87.5\u00b0) seems valid. Therefore, m/n = 175/2, so m + n = 177.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo solve the problem, we start by recognizing that the sum \\(\\sum_{k=1}^{35} \\sin(5k^\\circ)\\) involves sines of angles forming an arithmetic sequence: \\(5^\\circ, 10^\\circ, 15^\\circ, \\dots, 175^\\circ\\). There are 35 terms in total. \n\n**Key Formula**: The sum of sines in an arithmetic sequence is given by:\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \\sin(a + kd) = \\frac{\\sin\\left(\\frac{Nd}{2}\\right)}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{d}{2}\\right)} \\cdot \\sin\\left(a + \\frac{(N-1)d}{2}\\right).\n\\]\nHere, \\(a = 5^\\circ\\) (first term), \\(d = 5^\\circ\\) (common difference), and \\(N = 35\\) (number of terms). Adjusting for the sum starting at \\(k=1\\), we use \\(k=0\\) to \\(34\\) instead, which aligns with the formula.\n\n**Applying the Formula**:\n1. Compute \\(\\frac{Nd}{2} = \\frac{35 \\cdot 5^\\circ}{2} = 87.5^\\circ\\).\n2. Compute \\(\\frac{d}{2} = 2.5^\\circ\\).\n3. Compute \\(a + \\frac{(N-1)d}{2} = 5^\\circ + \\frac{34 \\cdot 5^\\circ}{2} = 5^\\circ + 85^\\circ = 90^\\circ\\).\n\nSubstituting into the formula:\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=1}^{35} \\sin(5k^\\circ) = \\frac{\\sin(87.5^\\circ)}{\\sin(2.5^\\circ)} \\cdot \\sin(90^\\circ).\n\\]\nSince \\(\\sin(90^\\circ) = 1\\), this simplifies to:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sin(87.5^\\circ)}{\\sin(2.5^\\circ)}.\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying Further**:\nNotice that \\(\\sin(87.5^\\circ) = \\cos(2.5^\\circ)\\) (using \\(\\sin(90^\\circ - x) = \\cos(x)\\)). Thus:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\cos(2.5^\\circ)}{\\sin(2.5^\\circ)} = \\cot(2.5^\\circ).\n\\]\nBut \\(\\cot(\\theta) = \\tan(90^\\circ - \\theta)\\), so:\n\\[\n\\cot(2.5^\\circ) = \\tan(87.5^\\circ).\n\\]\n\n**Final Step**:\nThe problem states this equals \\(\\tan\\left(\\frac{m}{n}\\right)\\) where \\(\\frac{m}{n} < 90^\\circ\\). Here, \\(87.5^\\circ = \\frac{175}{2}^\\circ\\), so \\(m = 175\\) and \\(n = 2\\). Since 175 and 2 are coprime, their sum is \\(175 + 2 = 177\\). \n\nThus, the answer is \\(\\boxed{177}\\).",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is to find the value of y in the arithmetic sequence y + 6, 12, y, and show that it's 9. Hmm, arithmetic sequences have a common difference between consecutive terms. So, the difference between the first and second term should be the same as the difference between the second and third term.\n\nFirst, let me recall what an arithmetic sequence is. In an arithmetic sequence, each term after the first is obtained by adding a constant difference. So, the difference between the second term and the first term is the same as the difference between the third term and the second term. That's the key property here.\n\nGiven the sequence: y + 6, 12, y. Let's label the terms as Term1, Term2, Term3. So Term1 is y + 6, Term2 is 12, Term3 is y. The common difference should be the same between Term2 - Term1 and Term3 - Term2.\n\nSo, setting up the equation: Term2 - Term1 = Term3 - Term2. Plugging in the terms, that would be 12 - (y + 6) = y - 12. Let me check that. Yes, because the difference between the second and first term is 12 minus (y + 6), and the difference between the third and second term is y minus 12. These two differences must be equal for it to be an arithmetic sequence.\n\nNow, let's simplify the equation. Starting with 12 - (y + 6) = y - 12. Distribute the negative sign: 12 - y - 6 = y - 12. Combine like terms on the left: (12 - 6) - y = y - 12, which simplifies to 6 - y = y - 12.\n\nNow, solve for y. Let's get all the y terms on one side and constants on the other. Add y to both sides: 6 = 2y - 12. Then add 12 to both sides: 18 = 2y. Divide both sides by 2: y = 9. That gives y as 9, which is what we needed to show.\n\nWait, let me verify this. If y is 9, then the terms are 9 + 6 = 15, 12, and 9. Let's check the differences. 12 - 15 = -3, and 9 - 12 = -3. So the common difference is -3, which makes it an arithmetic sequence. Yep, that works. So the value of y is indeed 9.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo find the value of \\( y \\) in the arithmetic sequence \\( y + 6 \\), \\( 12 \\), \\( y \\), we use the defining property of an arithmetic sequence: **the difference between consecutive terms is constant**. \n\nLet\u2019s denote the terms as follows:\n- First term: \\( y + 6 \\)\n- Second term: \\( 12 \\)\n- Third term: \\( y \\)\n\nThe difference between the second and first term must equal the difference between the third and second term. This gives the equation:\n\\[\n12 - (y + 6) = y - 12\n\\]\nSimplifying the left side:\n\\[\n12 - y - 6 = y - 12 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 6 - y = y - 12\n\\]\nTo solve for \\( y \\), add \\( y \\) to both sides:\n\\[\n6 = 2y - 12\n\\]\nThen add \\( 12 \\) to both sides:\n\\[\n18 = 2y\n\\]\nFinally, divide by \\( 2 \\):\n\\[\ny = 9\n\\]\n\n**Verification:** Substitute \\( y = 9 \\) back into the sequence:\n- First term: \\( 9 + 6 = 15 \\)\n- Second term: \\( 12 \\)\n- Third term: \\( 9 \\)\n\nThe differences are \\( 12 - 15 = -3 \\) and \\( 9 - 12 = -3 \\), confirming a constant difference.

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to prove that this system of homogeneous equations only has the trivial solution where all variables are zero. The conditions given are that the diagonal coefficients are positive, the off-diagonal ones are negative, and each equation's coefficients sum to a positive number. Hmm.\n\nSo, first, since it's a homogeneous system, the trivial solution always exists. The key is to show there are no non-trivial solutions. Maybe I can use contradiction. Suppose there's a non-trivial solution (x1, x2, x3) not all zero. Then, each equation sums to zero.\n\nWait, condition (c) says that in each equation, the sum of coefficients is positive. Wait, the coefficients are a11, a12, a13, etc. So for each equation, a_i1 + a_i2 + a_i3 > 0. But each equation is a_i1 x1 + a_i2 x2 + a_i3 x3 = 0. Hmm.\n\nLet me think. If I sum the coefficients of each equation, that's a_i1 + a_i2 + a_i3 > 0. But the equation itself is the sum of a_ij x_j. Maybe if I plug in the variables, but how does that relate to the sum of coefficients?\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider substituting x1, x2, x3 with some values. Wait, but since it's homogeneous, scaling a solution gives another solution. Maybe assume that one of the variables is the largest in absolute value. For example, suppose x1 is the largest. Then, maybe use the equations to derive a contradiction.\n\nWait, here's an idea. Let's suppose there's a non-trivial solution. Then, at least one of x1, x2, x3 is non-zero. Let's consider the maximum absolute value among them. Without loss of generality, say |x1| is the largest. Then, maybe look at the first equation: a11 x1 + a12 x2 + a13 x3 = 0. Since a11 is positive, and a12, a13 are negative. Let's rearrange this equation.\n\na11 x1 = -a12 x2 - a13 x3. Since a12 and a13 are negative, their negatives are positive. So, a11 x1 is equal to positive terms times x2 and x3. But since |x1| is the largest, maybe |x2| and |x3| are less than or equal to |x1|. Then, the right-hand side would be positive numbers times variables that are smaller in magnitude. But a11 is positive, so x1 would have to be positive if the right-hand side is positive. Wait, but variables could be positive or negative. Hmm, maybe this approach is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the fact that the sum of coefficients in each equation is positive. Let's take the sum of each equation. For the first equation, a11 + a12 + a13 > 0. But the equation itself is a11 x1 + a12 x2 + a13 x3 = 0. If I set x1 = x2 = x3 = 1, then the left-hand side would be (a11 + a12 + a13) which is positive, but that's not a solution. Wait, but the variables are supposed to be a solution. So if I plug in x1 = x2 = x3 = 1, it's not a solution. But maybe if the variables are all equal, but scaled somehow.\n\nWait, maybe consider that if there's a non-trivial solution, then there's a solution where all variables are non-negative (since if variables have different signs, maybe take absolute values or something). Wait, but variables can be positive or negative. Maybe assume that the maximum among |x1|, |x2|, |x3| is achieved by x1, and then look at the first equation. Let's say x1 is positive (since if it's negative, we can multiply the solution by -1). So x1 >= |x2| and x1 >= |x3|.\n\nThen, the first equation: a11 x1 + a12 x2 + a13 x3 = 0. Since a12 and a13 are negative, their coefficients times x2 and x3 would be negative terms (since x2 and x3 could be positive or negative). Wait, but if x2 and x3 are positive, then a12 x2 and a13 x3 are negative. If x2 or x3 is negative, then those terms become positive. Hmm, this is getting messy.\n\nWait, maybe use the fact that the sum of coefficients in each equation is positive. Let's consider adding up all three equations. But each equation equals zero, so their sum is zero. But the sum of all coefficients (each equation's sum) would be positive + positive + positive = positive. But how does that relate?\n\nAlternatively, think of each equation as a_i1 x1 + a_i2 x2 + a_i3 x3 = 0. Let me denote S_i = a_i1 + a_i2 + a_i3 > 0 for each i. If I set x1 = x2 = x3 = t, then substituting into the equation gives S_i t = 0. Since S_i > 0, t must be zero. But that's just the trivial solution. But maybe this suggests that if variables are equal, only the trivial solution works. But variables don't have to be equal in a non-trivial solution.\n\nAnother approach: use the fact that the system is homogeneous, so non-trivial solutions exist iff the determinant is zero. But proving determinant is non-zero under these conditions. But determinant might be complicated here. The conditions given are about the signs of the coefficients and the sum per equation. Maybe use Gershgorin's circle theorem? Since the diagonal entries are positive, and off-diagonal are negative. The Gershgorin circles would have centers at a_ii (positive) and radii equal to the sum of the absolute values of the off-diagonal entries. Since the off-diagonal entries are negative, their absolute values are |a_ij| = -a_ij (since a_ij is negative). So the radius for row i is sum_{j\u2260i} |a_ij| = sum_{j\u2260i} (-a_ij). But the sum of coefficients in the equation is a_i1 + a_i2 + a_i3 = (a_ii) + sum_{j\u2260i} a_ij > 0. Since a_ii is positive and sum_{j\u2260i} a_ij is negative (because those are negative coefficients). So the sum S_i = a_ii + sum_{j\u2260i} a_ij > 0. Therefore, sum_{j\u2260i} a_ij = S_i - a_ii. But sum_{j\u2260i} |a_ij| = sum_{j\u2260i} (-a_ij) = - sum_{j\u2260i} a_ij = -(sum_{j\u2260i} a_ij) = -(S_i - a_ii) = a_ii - S_i. \n\nWait, the radius for Gershgorin circle would be sum_{j\u2260i} |a_ij| = a_ii - S_i. But S_i is positive. So the radius is a_ii - S_i. For the Gershgorin circle to lie in the right half-plane (so that all eigenvalues have positive real parts), we need that the center a_ii > radius. That is, a_ii > (a_ii - S_i) \u2192 which simplifies to 0 > -S_i \u2192 S_i > 0, which is given. So each Gershgorin circle is centered at a_ii >0 with radius a_ii - S_i. Since S_i = a_ii + sum_{j\u2260i} a_ij >0, but sum_{j\u2260i} a_ij is negative. So S_i = a_ii + (negative number) >0. Therefore, a_ii > |sum_{j\u2260i} a_ij}|. Wait, but sum_{j\u2260i} a_ij is negative, so |sum_{j\u2260i} a_ij}| = - sum_{j\u2260i} a_ij. Then, S_i = a_ii + sum_{j\u2260i} a_ij >0 \u2192 a_ii > - sum_{j\u2260i} a_ij \u2192 a_ii > |sum_{j\u2260i} a_ij}|. Therefore, the radius is sum_{j\u2260i} |a_ij| = - sum_{j\u2260i} a_ij = |sum_{j\u2260i} a_ij}| < a_ii. Therefore, each Gershgorin circle lies in the right half-plane, not containing zero. Hence, all eigenvalues have positive real parts, so the matrix is invertible, determinant non-zero, so only trivial solution. But this might be too advanced for an informal proof, especially if the context doesn't mention eigenvalues or Gershgorin. Maybe need a more elementary approach.\n\nAlternatively, suppose there's a non-trivial solution. Let's pick the variable with the maximum absolute value, say |x1| is the largest. Then, in the first equation: a11 x1 = -a12 x2 -a13 x3. Since a12 and a13 are negative, their negatives are positive. So, a11 x1 = (positive)(x2) + (positive)(x3). But since |x2| and |x3| are \u2264 |x1|, then the right-hand side is \u2264 (positive)(|x1|) + (positive)(|x1|) = (|a12| + |a13|)|x1|. But a11 is positive. So |a11 x1| \u2264 (|a12| + |a13|)|x1|. Dividing both sides by |x1| (since it's non-zero), we get a11 \u2264 |a12| + |a13|. But wait, from condition (c), the sum of coefficients in the first equation is a11 + a12 + a13 >0. Since a12 and a13 are negative, this sum is a11 - |a12| - |a13| >0 \u2192 a11 > |a12| + |a13|. But this contradicts the previous inequality a11 \u2264 |a12| + |a13|. Therefore, our assumption of a non-trivial solution must be wrong. Hence, only the trivial solution exists.\n\nYes, that seems like a good approach. Let me check again. Assume there's a non-trivial solution. Let x1 be the variable with maximum absolute value. Then in the first equation, rearrange to a11 x1 = -a12 x2 -a13 x3. Since a12 and a13 are negative, their negatives are positive. So RHS is |a12|x2 + |a13|x3. But since |x2| and |x3| \u2264 |x1|, then |RHS| \u2264 |a12||x1| + |a13||x1|. So |a11 x1| \u2264 (|a12| + |a13|)|x1|. Divide by |x1| (non-zero) to get |a11| \u2264 |a12| + |a13|. But from condition (c), a11 + a12 + a13 >0. Since a12 and a13 are negative, this is a11 - |a12| - |a13| >0 \u2192 a11 > |a12| + |a13|. But this contradicts the previous inequality. Therefore, no such solution exists except the trivial one. That works for the first equation. But what if the maximum variable is x2 or x3? Then we need to apply the same logic to the corresponding equation. For example, if |x2| is the maximum, use the second equation. Similarly for x3. So the argument holds regardless of which variable is the maximum. Therefore, in any case, we reach a contradiction, hence only the trivial solution exists.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo show that the given system of equations has only the trivial solution \\( x_1 = x_2 = x_3 = 0 \\), we proceed by contradiction.

Thus, the right-hand side (RHS) is a sum of positive terms scaled by \\( x_2 \\) and \\( x_3 \\).  \n\n**Step 2: Bound the magnitudes**  \nUsing the assumption \\( |x_1| \\geq |x_2| \\) and \\( |x_1| \\geq |x_3| \\), we bound the RHS:  \n\\[\n|a_{11}x_1| \\leq |a_{12}||x_2| + |a_{13}||x_3| \\leq |a_{12}||x_1| + |a_{13}||x_1|.\n\\]  \nDividing both sides by \\( |x_1| \\) (which is non-zero), we obtain:  \n\\[\na_{11} \\leq |a_{12}| + |a_{13}|.\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Use condition (c) to derive a contradiction**  \nCondition (c) states that the sum of coefficients in the first equation is positive:  \n\\[\na_{11} + a_{12} + a_{13} > 0.\n\\]  \nSince \\( a_{12} \\) and \\( a_{13} \\) are negative, this inequality becomes:  \n\\[\na_{11} - |a_{12}| - |a_{13}| > 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad a_{11} > |a_{12}| + |a_{13}|.\n\\]  \nThis directly contradicts the earlier inequality \\( a_{11} \\leq |a_{12}| + |a_{13}| \\).  \n\n**Step 4: Generalize to all equations**  \nThe same logic applies if \\( x_2 \\) or \\( x_3 \\) is the variable with the largest absolute value. For example, if \\( |x_2| \\) is largest, use the second equation \\( a_{21}x_1 + a_{22}x_2 + a_{23}x_3 = 0 \\). By condition (c), \\( a_{22} > |a_{21}| + |a_{23}| \\), leading to a similar contradiction.  \n\n**Conclusion**  \nThe contradiction arises from assuming a non-trivial solution exists. Therefore, the only solution is \\( x_1 = x_2 = x_3 = 0 \\).",

The problem states three things: the distance from the x-axis is 6 units, the distance from (8,3) is 15 units, and the distance from the origin is sqrt(n), which we need to show is 52.\n\nFirst, the distance from the x-axis. I remember that the distance from a point to the x-axis is just the absolute value of its y-coordinate. Since the point is 6 units away, that means |y| = 6. But since both coordinates are negative, y must be -6. So, y = -6. That's straightforward.\n\nNext, the distance from the point (8,3) is 15 units. The distance formula between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is sqrt[(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2]. Applying this here, we get sqrt[(8 - x)^2 + (3 - y)^2] = 15. Since we already know y is -6, we can substitute that in. So, (8 - x)^2 + (3 - (-6))^2 = 15^2. Simplifying the second term: 3 + 6 is 9, so (8 - x)^2 + 81 = 225. Subtract 81 from both sides: (8 - x)^2 = 144. Taking square roots, 8 - x = \u00b112. But since x is negative, let's see. If 8 - x = 12, then x = 8 - 12 = -4. If 8 - x = -12, then x = 8 + 12 = 20. But x has to be negative, so x = -4 is the only valid solution. So, the point is (-4, -6).\n\nNow, we need to find the distance from the origin, which is sqrt[(-4)^2 + (-6)^2] = sqrt[16 + 36] = sqrt[52]. Therefore, n is 52. Let me double-check the steps. The y-coordinate was determined correctly from the distance to the x-axis. Then substituting into the distance formula with (8,3) gives a quadratic equation, solved correctly for x considering the negativity constraint. Then computing the distance from origin gives sqrt(52). Yep, that all adds up. So n is indeed 52.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nLet's break down the problem step by step. We need to find the value of \\( n \\) such that the distance from the origin to the point \\((x, y)\\) with both coordinates negative is \\(\\sqrt{n}\\). The point is also given to be 6 units from the \\(x\\)-axis and 15 units from \\((8, 3)\\). Here's how we solve it:\n\n1. **Distance from the \\(x\\)-axis**:  \n   The distance of a point \\((x, y)\\) from the \\(x\\)-axis is the absolute value of its \\(y\\)-coordinate. Since the point is 6 units away and \\(y\\) is negative (as both coordinates are negative), we conclude:  \n   \\[\n   |y| = 6 \\implies y = -6.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Distance from \\((8, 3)\\)**:  \n   Using the distance formula between \\((x, y)\\) and \\((8, 3)\\):  \n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{(8 - x)^2 + (3 - y)^2} = 15.\n   \\]  \n   Substitute \\(y = -6\\) into the equation:  \n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{(8 - x)^2 + (3 - (-6))^2} = 15 \\implies \\sqrt{(8 - x)^2 + 9^2} = 15.\n   \\]  \n   Square both sides to eliminate the square root:  \n   \\[\n   (8 - x)^2 + 81 = 225 \\implies (8 - x)^2 = 144.\n   \\]  \n   Take the square root of both sides:  \n   \\[\n   8 - x = \\pm 12.\n   \\]  \n   Solve for \\(x\\):  \n   - If \\(8 - x = 12\\), then \\(x = -4\\) (valid, since \\(x\\) is negative).  \n   - If \\(8 - x = -12\\), then \\(x = 20\\) (invalid, as \\(x\\) must be negative).  \n\n   Thus, \\(x = -4\\).\n\n3. **Distance from the origin**:  \n   The point is \\((-4, -6)\\). The distance from the origin \\((0, 0)\\) is:  \n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{(-4)^2 + (-6)^2} = \\sqrt{16 + 36} = \\sqrt{52}.\n   \\]  \n   Therefore, \\(n = 52\\).  \n\nThis confirms that the value of \\(n\\) is indeed **52**.\nPrevious attempt failed with: type mismatch\n  h\nhas type\n  |y| = -y \u2227 y < 0 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  y = -6 : Prop\nfunction expected at\n  sqrt_inj ?m.3721 ?m.3722\nterm has type\n  \u221a?m.3719 = \u221a?m.3720 \u2194 ?m.3719 = ?m.3720\nfailed to prove positivity/nonnegativity/nonzeroness\nfailed to prove positivity/nonnegativity/nonzeroness\ntype mismatch\n  h\u2085\nhas type\n  (x -

Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with remainders and modular arithmetic, sometimes patterns repeat. Like, maybe the powers of 2 modulo 7 cycle after a certain point. Let me check that.\n\nLet's compute the first few powers of 2 modulo 7:\n\n2\u2070 = 1 mod 7 \u2192 1\n2\u00b9 = 2 mod 7 \u2192 2\n2\u00b2 = 4 mod 7 \u2192 4\n2\u00b3 = 8 mod 7 \u2192 1 (since 8 - 7 = 1)\n2\u2074 = 16 mod 7 \u2192 2 (16 - 14 = 2)\n2\u2075 = 32 mod 7 \u2192 4 (32 - 28 = 4)\n2\u2076 = 64 mod 7 \u2192 1 (64 - 63 = 1)\n\nOh, look at that! The remainders cycle every 3 exponents: 1, 2, 4, then back to 1, 2, 4, etc. So the cycle length here is 3. That means 2\u00b3 \u2261 1 mod 7, 2\u2076 \u2261 1 mod 7, and so on. So every exponent that's a multiple of 3, like 3, 6, 9, etc., will give a remainder of 1 when divided by 7.\n\nNow, the sum is from 2\u2070 to 2\u00b9\u2070\u2070. Let's see how many terms there are. Since it starts at 0 and goes up to 100, that's 101 terms. But maybe grouping them into cycles of 3 will help.\n\nEach cycle of 3 terms (like 2\u2070, 2\u00b9, 2\u00b2) adds up to 1 + 2 + 4 = 7. And 7 mod 7 is 0. So each full cycle contributes 0 to the total modulo 7. That's useful!\n\nNow, how many full cycles are there in 101 terms? Let's divide 101 by 3. 3 \u00d7 33 = 99, so there are 33 full cycles (each of 3 terms) and 2 remaining terms (since 101 = 3\u00d733 + 2). Wait, 3\u00d733 is 99 terms, so the remaining terms are 100 - 99 = 1? Wait, no. Wait, the exponents go from 0 to 100, which is 101 terms. So 101 divided by 3 is 33 with a remainder of 2. So 33 full cycles (each 3 terms) and 2 leftover terms. Wait, 33\u00d73=99 terms, so the remaining terms are 101 - 99 = 2 terms. Those would be the last two terms: 2\u2079\u2079 and 2\u00b9\u2070\u2070? Wait, no. Wait, the exponents go up to 100. Let me check:\n\nIf each cycle is 3 terms: exponents 0,1,2; then 3,4,5; etc. So the 99th term would be exponent 98 (since 3\u00d733=99 terms would cover up to exponent 98). Then the remaining two terms are exponents 99 and 100. So the sum can be broken into 33 cycles of (2\u2070 + 2\u00b9 + 2\u00b2) up to 2\u2079\u2078 + 2\u2079\u2079 + 2\u00b9\u2070\u2070? Wait, no. Wait, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nWait, the sum is S = 2\u2070 + 2\u00b9 + 2\u00b2 + ... + 2\u00b9\u2070\u2070. The number of terms is 101. If each cycle is 3 terms, then 101 divided by 3 is 33 with a remainder of 2. So there are 33 full cycles (each contributing 7, which is 0 mod 7) and 2 leftover terms. The leftover terms would be the last two terms: 2\u2079\u2079 and 2\u00b9\u2070\u2070. Wait, but 33 cycles would cover up to 2^(3\u00d733 -1) = 2^98? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to note that the cycle repeats every 3 exponents. So 2\u00b3k \u2261 1 mod 7, 2\u00b3k+1 \u2261 2 mod 7, 2\u00b3k+2 \u2261 4 mod 7. So each group of three consecutive exponents (like 0,1,2; 3,4,5; etc.) will add up to 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 \u2261 0 mod 7. Therefore, every such group contributes 0 mod 7. So the entire sum modulo 7 is just the sum of the remaining terms that don't form a complete group.\n\nNow, how many complete groups are there in 101 terms? Let's see: 101 divided by 3 is 33 with a remainder of 2. So 33 groups (each of 3 terms) and 2 terms left. The 33 groups contribute 0 each, so the total is the sum of the last 2 terms. Wait, but the first term is 2\u2070, so the groups would be (0,1,2), (3,4,5), ..., up to (99,100,101)? Wait, no, because the exponents go up to 100. Wait, 3\u00d733=99 terms, so the first 99 terms are 33 groups of 3, and the remaining 2 terms are 2^99 and 2^100. Wait, but the sum is up to 2^100, which is the 101st term. So the first 99 terms (exponents 0 to 98) form 33 groups of 3, each adding to 0 mod 7. Then the remaining terms are 2^99 and 2^100. So the total sum mod 7 is (2^99 + 2^100) mod 7.\n\nBut wait, 2^99 and 2^100 can be simplified using the cycle. Since the cycle is 3, 2^99 = 2^(3*33) = (2^3)^33 \u2261 1^33 \u2261 1 mod 7. Then 2^100 = 2^(3*33 +1) = (2^3)^33 * 2^1 \u2261 1^33 * 2 \u2261 2 mod 7. So 2^99 + 2^100 \u2261 1 + 2 = 3 mod 7. Therefore, the total sum mod 7 is 3. That's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let's verify with smaller numbers. Suppose the sum is up to 2^2 (3 terms). Then sum is 1+2+4=7 \u22610 mod7. If up to 2^3 (4 terms), sum is 7 +8=15. 15 mod7 is 1. But according to the cycle, 2^3 \u22611, so sum would be 7 +1=8 \u22611 mod7. Wait, but according to the method, if there are 4 terms (n=3), 4 divided by3 is 1 group and 1 term left. The group sum is 7\u22610, and the leftover term is 2^3 \u22611. So total is 1 mod7. Which matches. So that works.\n\nSimilarly, if up to 2^4 (5 terms), sum is 1+2+4+1+2=10. 10 mod7 is 3. According to the method: 5 terms divided by3 is 1 group (3 terms) and 2 left. The group sum 0, leftover terms 2^3=1 and 2^4=2. Sum 1+2=3 mod7. Correct.\n\nSo applying this to 101 terms: 33 groups (0 mod7 each) and 2 leftover terms: 2^99 and 2^100. As 2^99 \u22611 and 2^100\u22612, sum is 3 mod7. Therefore, the remainder is 3. That makes sense.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo find the remainder when the sum \\(1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^3 + \\dots + 2^{100}\\) is divided by 7, observe that the powers of 2 modulo 7 repeat in a cycle. Calculating the first few terms:\n\n- \\(2^0 \\equiv 1 \\mod 7\\),\n- \\(2^1 \\equiv 2 \\mod 7\\),\n- \\(2^2 \\equiv 4 \\mod 7\\),\n- \\(2^3 \\equiv 1 \\mod 7\\) (since \\(8 - 7 = 1\\)),\n- \\(2^4 \\equiv 2 \\mod 7\\),\n- \\(2^5 \\equiv 4 \\mod 7\\),\n\nand so on. The pattern \\(1, 2, 4\\) repeats every 3 terms. This means every group of three consecutive terms in the sum \\(1 + 2 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 4 + \\dots\\) adds up to \\(1 + 2 + 4 = 7\\), which is congruent to \\(0 \\mod 7\\).\n\nThe total number of terms in the sum \\(1 + 2 + \\dots + 2^{100}\\) is \\(101\\) (from \\(2^0\\) to \\(2^{100}\\)). Dividing \\(101\\) by \\(3\\) gives \\(33\\) full cycles (99 terms) with a remainder of \\(2\\) terms. The \\(33\\) full cycles contribute \\(0 \\mod 7\\), leaving only the last two terms: \\(2^{99}\\) and \\(2^{100}\\).\n\nUsing the cycle:\n- \\(2^{99} = 2^{3 \\cdot 33} \\equiv 1^{33} \\equiv 1 \\mod 7\\),\n- \\(2^{100} = 2^{3 \\cdot 33 + 1} \\equiv 1^{33} \\cdot 2 \\equiv 2 \\mod 7\\).\n\nAdding these: \\(1 + 2 = 3\\).

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. We need to prove that the sum S(n) = \u2211_{k=0}^n C(2n+1, 2k+1) * 2^{3k} is not divisible by 5 for any integer n \u2265 0. Hmm, so the goal is to show that when you compute this sum, it's never a multiple of 5. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let me recall the context given. There's a theorem involving Fibonacci numbers and binomial coefficients with powers of 5. The theorem states that 2^{n-1} F_n equals the sum over k of 5^k * C(n, 2k+1). Also, there's an alternative form: 2^n F_n = 2 * sum over odd k of C(n, k) * 5^{(k-1)/2}. Maybe this is related? The problem here has binomial coefficients with 2^{3k}, which is 8^k. So perhaps there's a connection to Fibonacci numbers or generating functions?\n\nWait, the problem's sum involves C(2n+1, 2k+1) * 8^k. Let's note that 8 is 2^3, so 8^k = 2^{3k}. The binomial coefficients here are for odd terms in the expansion. Maybe we can relate this sum to a generating function or use a substitution to express it in terms of known sequences, like Fibonacci numbers.\n\nLooking at the theorem in the context, the key idea was expressing Fibonacci numbers using binomial coefficients and powers of 5. Maybe we can reverse-engineer this. If the theorem connects F_n to sums with 5^k and binomial coefficients, perhaps our problem, which has 8^k, could be connected to a similar expression but modulo 5. Since 8 \u2261 3 mod 5, 8^k \u2261 3^k mod 5. So maybe we can consider the sum modulo 5 and show it's never congruent to 0.\n\nLet me try to compute S(n) modulo 5. Let's rewrite 8^k as (5 + 3)^k, but that might not help directly. Alternatively, since 8 \u2261 3 mod 5, 8^k \u2261 3^k mod 5. So S(n) mod 5 is the sum over k of C(2n+1, 2k+1) * 3^k mod 5. We need to show this sum is never 0 mod 5.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can find a closed-form expression for S(n) and then analyze it modulo 5. Let's think about generating functions. The sum involves binomial coefficients with odd indices. Recall that the sum of C(m, 2k+1) x^k is related to ( (1 + sqrt(x))^m - (1 - sqrt(x))^m ) / (2 sqrt(x)) ). Let's test that.\n\nSuppose we set x = 8. Then the sum S(n) is \u2211_{k=0}^n C(2n+1, 2k+1) * 8^k. Let me consider m = 2n+1. Then the sum becomes \u2211_{k=0}^{(m-1)/2} C(m, 2k+1) * 8^k. Let's let x = 8. Then, using the identity for the sum over odd binomial coefficients times x^k:\n\nSum_{k} C(m, 2k+1) x^k = [ (1 + sqrt(x))^m - (1 - sqrt(x))^m ] / (2 sqrt(x)).\n\nYes, that's a standard identity. Let's apply this here. Let x = 8, so sqrt(x) = 2\u221a2. Wait, but maybe working modulo 5 would be better. Let me compute this expression modulo 5.\n\nBut first, let's compute the sum S(n) using the identity. So S(n) = [ (1 + sqrt(8))^{2n+1} - (1 - sqrt(8))^{2n+1} ] / (2 sqrt(8)).\n\nSimplify sqrt(8) as 2\u221a2, but maybe that's not helpful here. Alternatively, let's compute this modulo 5. Let's note that 8 \u2261 3 mod 5, so sqrt(8) modulo 5. Wait, but 8 mod 5 is 3, so we need to see if 3 is a quadratic residue modulo 5. The quadratic residues mod 5 are 0,1,4. So 3 is not a quadratic residue mod 5. Therefore, sqrt(3) doesn't exist in integers mod 5. Hmm, this complicates things. Maybe this approach isn't the best.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute S(n) modulo 5 directly. Let's note that 8 \u2261 3 mod 5, so 8^k \u2261 3^k mod 5. Therefore, S(n) \u2261 \u2211_{k=0}^n C(2n+1, 2k+1) * 3^k mod 5. Let's denote this sum as T(n) = \u2211 C(2n+1, 2k+1) 3^k. We need to show T(n) \u2261\u0338 0 mod 5 for any n \u2265 0.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can find a recurrence relation for T(n) modulo 5. Let's try small values of n to see a pattern.\n\nFor n = 0: Sum is k=0 to 0: C(1,1)*3^0 = 1*1 = 1. 1 mod 5 is 1 \u2260 0.\n\nn = 1: Sum over k=0 and 1 (but 2n+1=3, so k can be 0 and 1). C(3,1)*3^0 + C(3,3)*3^1 = 3*1 + 1*3 = 3 + 3 = 6 \u2261 1 mod 5. Not 0.\n\nn = 2: 2n+1=5. Sum k=0 to 2: C(5,1)*3^0 + C(5,3)*3^1 + C(5,5)*3^2. That's 5*1 + 10*3 + 1*9 = 5 + 30 +9 =44 \u2261 44 mod5=44-8*5=44-40=4\u22614\u22600.\n\nn=3: 2n+1=7. Sum k=0 to 3: C(7,1)*1 + C(7,3)*3 + C(7,5)*9 + C(7,7)*27. Compute:\n\nC(7,1)=7, C(7,3)=35, C(7,5)=21, C(7,7)=1.\n\nSo sum is 7*1 +35*3 +21*9 +1*27 =7 +105 +189 +27= 328. 328 mod5: 325 is 65*5=325, so 328-325=3\u22613\u22600.\n\nn=4: 2n+1=9. Sum k=0 to4: C(9,1)*1 + C(9,3)*3 + C(9,5)*9 + C(9,7)*27 + C(9,9)*81.\n\nCompute:\n\nC(9,1)=9, C(9,3)=84, C(9,5)=126, C(9,7)=36, C(9,9)=1.\n\nSum:9*1 +84*3 +126*9 +36*27 +1*81 =9 +252 +1134 +972 +81= (9+252)=261; 261+1134=1395; 1395+972=2367; 2367+81=2448. 2448 mod5: 2445 is 5*489=2445, so 2448-2445=3\u22613\u22600.\n\nHmm, so for n=0 to4, the sums modulo5 are 1,1,4,3,3. None are zero. Maybe this pattern continues. But how to prove it for all n?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find a recurrence relation for T(n) modulo5. Let's see if there's a pattern in the values. Let's compute T(n) mod5 for more n.\n\nn=5: 2n+1=11. Sum k=0 to5: C(11,1)*1 + C(11,3)*3 + C(11,5)*9 + C(11,7)*27 + C(11,9)*81 + C(11,11)*243.\n\nCompute each term modulo5:\n\nC(11,1)=11\u22611 mod5, so 1*1=1.\n\nC(11,3)=165\u2261165-33*5=165-165=0 mod5. So 0*3=0.\n\nC(11,5)=462\u2261462-92*5=462-460=2 mod5. 2*9=18\u22613 mod5.\n\nC(11,7)=330\u2261330-66*5=0 mod5. 0*27=0.\n\nC(11,9)=55\u226155-11*5=0 mod5. 0*81=0.\n\nC(11,11)=1. 1*243\u2261243 mod5. 243/5=48*5=240, 243-240=3. So 3.\n\nTotal sum mod5:1+0+3+0+0+3=7\u22612 mod5\u22600.\n\nSo n=5 gives 2 mod5. Still not zero.\n\nSo far, for n=0 to5, the results mod5 are 1,1,4,3,3,2. No zeros. This suggests that maybe the sum is never 0 mod5. But how to generalize?\n\nPerhaps we can find a recurrence relation for T(n) modulo5. Let's try to express T(n+1) in terms of T(n). But since T(n) is defined with 2n+1, moving from n to n+1 increases the upper index by 2. Maybe using properties of binomial coefficients.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the generating function approach again. Let's define G(x) = \u2211_{n=0}^\u221e T(n) x^n. Then, T(n) is the sum over k of C(2n+1,2k+1)3^k. Let's see if we can express G(x) in a closed form.\n\nAlternatively, note that T(n) can be written as [ (1 + sqrt(3))^{2n+1} - (1 - sqrt(3))^{2n+1} ] / (2 sqrt(3)). Let's verify this identity. For example, expanding (1 + sqrt(3))^m using the binomial theorem, the odd terms will involve sqrt(3)^{2k+1}, which would give 3^k sqrt(3). Then, subtracting (1 - sqrt(3))^m and dividing by 2 sqrt(3) would give the sum of C(m,2k+1)3^k. So yes, this identity holds. Therefore, T(n) = [ (1 + sqrt(3))^{2n+1} - (1 - sqrt(3))^{2n+1} ] / (2 sqrt(3)).\n\nBut how does this help modulo5? Let's compute (1 + sqrt(3)) and (1 - sqrt(3)) modulo5. Wait, but sqrt(3) modulo5 isn't an integer. However, perhaps we can work in an extension field or find a pattern in the exponents.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute the expression modulo5. Let\u2019s denote a = (1 + sqrt(3)) and b = (1 - sqrt(3)). Then T(n) = (a^{2n+1} - b^{2n+1})/(2 sqrt(3)). Let's compute a and b modulo5. But sqrt(3) mod5 is problematic since 3 is not a quadratic residue mod5. However, perhaps we can consider a and b as elements of GF(5^2), the finite field with 25 elements, where sqrt(3) exists.\n\nIn GF(5), the equation x^2 =3 has no solution, but in GF(25), it does. Let's find sqrt(3) in GF(25). Let's suppose that sqrt(3) is some element \u03b1 such that \u03b1^2=3. Let's compute \u03b1 in GF(25). Since GF(25) is constructed as GF(5)[x]/(x^2 -3), which is a field extension. So elements are of the form a + b\u03b1 where a,b \u2208 GF(5) and \u03b1^2=3.\n\nThen, a =1 + \u03b1, b=1 - \u03b1. Let's compute a^2 and b^2:\n\na^2 = (1 + \u03b1)^2 =1 + 2\u03b1 + \u03b1^2 =1 + 2\u03b1 +3=4 + 2\u03b1.\n\nSimilarly, b^2=(1 - \u03b1)^2=1 -2\u03b1 +\u03b1^2=1 -2\u03b1 +3=4 -2\u03b1.\n\nBut maybe we can find a recurrence relation for a^{2n+1} and b^{2n+1}. Let's note that a and b satisfy the quadratic equation x^2 - 2x -2=0. Wait, let's check:\n\na =1 + \u03b1. Then a^2 = (1 + \u03b1)^2 =1 + 2\u03b1 + \u03b1^2. Since \u03b1^2=3, this is 1 +2\u03b1 +3=4 +2\u03b1. But 4 \u2261 -1 mod5, so a^2 = -1 +2\u03b1. Then, a^2 -2a = (-1 +2\u03b1) -2(1 +\u03b1) = -1 +2\u03b1 -2 -2\u03b1 = -3 \u2261 2 mod5. So a^2 -2a +2=0? Wait, a^2=2a +2 mod5? Let me check:\n\nIf a^2 =4 +2\u03b1 mod5, and 2a +2=2(1 +\u03b1) +2=2 +2\u03b1 +2=4 +2\u03b1. So yes, a^2=2a +2 mod5. Similarly, b^2=2b +2 mod5. Therefore, both a and b satisfy the recurrence x^2 =2x +2 mod5.\n\nTherefore, the sequence a^{m} and b^{m} satisfy the linear recurrence relation s_{m+2} =2s_{m+1} +2s_m. Similarly for b^m.\n\nTherefore, the terms a^{2n+1} and b^{2n+1} can be modeled by this recurrence. Let's denote u_m = a^m - b^m. Then, since a and b satisfy the same recurrence, u_{m+2} =2u_{m+1} +2u_m.\n\nBut T(n) = u_{2n+1}/(2 sqrt(3)). However, since we are working modulo5, and sqrt(3) is \u03b1, which is in GF(25), we can consider the entire expression modulo5. However, this might get complicated. Alternatively, notice that u_{m} = a^m - b^m, and since a and b are roots of x^2 -2x -2=0, the sequence u_m satisfies the recurrence u_{m+2} =2u_{m+1} +2u_m.\n\nLet\u2019s compute u_m modulo5 for various m to find a pattern. Let's start with m=1:\n\nu_1 = a^1 - b^1 = (1 + \u03b1) - (1 - \u03b1) =2\u03b1.\n\nu_2 = a^2 - b^2 = (4 +2\u03b1) - (4 -2\u03b1) =4\u03b1.\n\nBut wait, modulo5, 4 \u2261 -1, so u_2 \u2261 -1*2\u03b1 + ... Wait, maybe better to compute using the recurrence.\n\nWait, the recurrence is u_{m+2} =2u_{m+1} +2u_m. Let's compute u_1 and u_2:\n\nFrom m=1: u_1 =2\u03b1.\n\nm=2: u_2 =2u_1 +2u_0. Wait, u_0 =a^0 -b^0=1-1=0. So u_2=2u_1 +0=4\u03b1.\n\nm=3: u_3=2u_2 +2u_1=2*(4\u03b1) +2*(2\u03b1)=8\u03b1 +4\u03b1=12\u03b1\u226112\u03b1 mod5=2\u03b1 +2\u03b1=4\u03b1? Wait, 8 mod5=3, 4 mod5=4. So 3\u03b1 +4\u03b1=7\u03b1\u22612\u03b1 mod5. Wait, no, 8\u03b1 +4\u03b1=12\u03b1. 12 mod5=2, so 12\u03b1=2\u03b1 mod5. So u_3=2\u03b1.\n\nm=4: u_4=2u_3 +2u_2=2*(2\u03b1) +2*(4\u03b1)=4\u03b1 +8\u03b1=12\u03b1\u22612\u03b1 mod5.\n\nm=5: u_5=2u_4 +2u_3=2*(2\u03b1) +2*(2\u03b1)=4\u03b1 +4\u03b1=8\u03b1\u22613\u03b1 mod5.\n\nm=6: u_6=2u_5 +2u_4=2*(3\u03b1) +2*(2\u03b1)=6\u03b1 +4\u03b1=10\u03b1\u22610 mod5.\n\nWait, this seems inconsistent. Maybe I made a mistake in applying the recurrence.

So, we're given that sec x plus tan x equals 22/7, and we need to find csc x plus cot x in lowest terms as m/n and then compute m + n. The answer should be 044, which I guess is 44. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that there's an identity involving tan x + cot x equals sec x csc x from the context provided. But here, the problem is about sec x + tan x and csc x + cot x. Maybe there's a similar identity or a way to relate these expressions.\n\nLet me write down what's given:\n\nsec x + tan x = 22/7\n\nWe need to find csc x + cot x = m/n, then m + n.\n\nHmm. Maybe I can express csc x + cot x in terms of sec x and tan x somehow. Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to solve for sin x and cos x using the given equation and then substitute into the expression for csc x + cot x.\n\nLet me recall that sec x is 1/cos x, tan x is sin x / cos x, csc x is 1/sin x, and cot x is cos x / sin x. So, maybe if I can find expressions for sin x and cos x, or relate them through the given equation.\n\nStarting with the given equation:\n\nsec x + tan x = 22/7\n\nSubstituting the definitions:\n\n1/cos x + sin x / cos x = 22/7\n\nCombine the terms:\n\n(1 + sin x)/cos x = 22/7\n\nSo, (1 + sin x)/cos x = 22/7. Let's call this equation (1).\n\nNow, maybe I can solve for sin x in terms of cos x or vice versa. Let's try to express this as:\n\n1 + sin x = (22/7) cos x\n\nBut I know that sin^2 x + cos^2 x = 1. Maybe I can use that identity to solve for sin x and cos x.\n\nLet me denote sin x as S and cos x as C for simplicity. Then:\n\n1 + S = (22/7) C\n\nAnd we also have S^2 + C^2 = 1.\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1. 1 + S = (22/7) C\n\n2. S^2 + C^2 = 1\n\nLet me solve equation 1 for S:\n\nS = (22/7) C - 1\n\nNow substitute this into equation 2:\n\n[(22/7 C - 1)^2] + C^2 = 1\n\nExpand the square:\n\n( (22/7 C)^2 - 2*(22/7 C)*1 + 1^2 ) + C^2 = 1\n\nCompute each term:\n\n( (484/49)C^2 - (44/7)C + 1 ) + C^2 = 1\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n484/49 C^2 + C^2 - 44/7 C + 1 = 1\n\nConvert C^2 to 49/49 C^2 to combine:\n\n484/49 C^2 + 49/49 C^2 = (484 + 49)/49 C^2 = 533/49 C^2\n\nSo now:\n\n533/49 C^2 - 44/7 C + 1 = 1\n\nSubtract 1 from both sides:\n\n533/49 C^2 - 44/7 C = 0\n\nFactor out C:\n\nC (533/49 C - 44/7) = 0\n\nSo, either C = 0 or 533/49 C - 44/7 = 0\n\nBut if C = 0, then cos x is 0, which would make sec x undefined, so that's not possible. So we take the other case:\n\n533/49 C = 44/7\n\nMultiply both sides by 49:\n\n533 C = 44/7 * 49\n\nCalculate 44/7 * 49: 44 * 7 = 308, so 44 * 49 /7 = 44 *7 = 308\n\nWait, 49 divided by 7 is 7, so 44 *7 = 308. So:\n\n533 C = 308\n\nTherefore, C = 308 / 533\n\nSo cos x = 308/533\n\nNow, substitute back into equation 1 to find S:\n\n1 + S = (22/7)(308/533)\n\nCalculate (22/7)(308/533):\n\nFirst, 22 * 308 = let's compute 22*300=6600 and 22*8=176, so total 6600 + 176 = 6776\n\nThen divide by 7*533 = 3731\n\nSo 6776 / 3731\n\nBut 6776 divided by 7 is 968.285... Wait, maybe simplify:\n\nWait, 22/7 * 308 = 22*(308/7) = 22*44 = 968\n\nBecause 308 divided by 7 is 44. So 22*44 = 968\n\nTherefore, 1 + S = 968 / 533\n\nSo S = (968 / 533) - 1 = (968 - 533)/533 = 435/533\n\nTherefore, sin x = 435/533\n\nNow, we need to find csc x + cot x.\n\ncsc x = 1/sin x = 533/435\n\ncot x = cos x / sin x = (308/533)/(435/533) = 308/435\n\nTherefore, csc x + cot x = 533/435 + 308/435 = (533 + 308)/435 = 841/435\n\nNow, check if 841 and 435 have any common factors.\n\nLet's see. 435 factors into 5*87 = 5*3*29. 841 divided by 29: 29*29 is 841. So 841 = 29^2. 435 = 5*3*29. So common factor is 29.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 29:\n\n841 \u00f729 = 29\n\n435 \u00f729 = 15\n\nSo simplified to 29/15. Therefore, m =29, n=15, so m +n=44.\n\nWhich matches the 044 mentioned. So the answer is 44.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nAlright, let's start by working with the given equation: \\(\\sec x + \\tan x = \\frac{22}{7}\\). Our goal is to find \\(\\csc x + \\cot x\\) in lowest terms and compute \\(m + n\\) where the result is \\(\\frac{m}{n}\\).\n\nFirst, rewrite \\(\\sec x + \\tan x\\) using definitions:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\cos x} + \\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos x} = \\frac{22}{7}.\n\\]\nCombine the terms:\n\\[\n\\frac{1 + \\sin x}{\\cos x} = \\frac{22}{7}.\n\\]\nLet\u2019s call this **Equation (1)**.

Notice \\(841 = 29^2\\) and \\(435 = 15 \\times 29\\). Divide numerator and denominator by \\(29\\):\n\\[\n\\frac{29}{15}.\n\\]\nThus, \\(m = 29\\) and \\(n = 15\\), so \\(m + n = 29 + 15 = 44\\).

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is asking which of the options A to E equals 12^{mn} for all integers m and n, given that P = 2^m and Q = 3^n. The answer is supposed to be E) P^{2n} Q^m. I need to show why that's the case.\n\nFirst, I remember that 12 can be factored into primes: 12 = 2^2 * 3^1. So 12^{mn} would be (2^2 * 3)^mn. Using exponent rules, that's 2^{2mn} * 3^{mn}.\n\nNow, let's look at the options. Each option is some combination of P and Q raised to different exponents. Since P is 2^m and Q is 3^n, substituting those into each option should give expressions in terms of 2 and 3. The goal is to see which one matches 2^{2mn} * 3^{mn}.\n\nLet's take option E: P^{2n} Q^m. Substituting P and Q here gives (2^m)^{2n} * (3^n)^m. Simplifying exponents, that's 2^{2mn} * 3^{mn}, which matches exactly what we have for 12^{mn}. So that's the right answer.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check the other options to make sure. Let's take option B: P^n Q^m. That would be (2^m)^n * (3^n)^m = 2^{mn} * 3^{mn} = (2*3)^{mn} = 6^{mn}, which is not 12^{mn}. So B is wrong.\n\nOption C: P^n Q^{2m} would be (2^m)^n * (3^n)^{2m} = 2^{mn} * 3^{2mn} = 3^{mn} * 2^{mn} * 3^{mn} = 3^{mn} * 6^{mn}, which is 18^{mn}, not 12^{mn}.\n\nOption D: P^{2m} Q^n is (2^m)^{2m} * (3^n)^n = 2^{2m^2} * 3^{n^2}, which depends on m squared and n squared, not mn. So that's not matching.\n\nOption A: P^2 Q is (2^m)^2 * 3^n = 2^{2m} * 3^n, which is fixed for any m and n, but 12^{mn} varies with mn. So A is out.\n\nTherefore, E is the only one that simplifies to 2^{2mn} * 3^{mn}, which is exactly 12^{mn}.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo determine which expression equals \\(12^{mn}\\) for all integers \\(m\\) and \\(n\\), start by expressing \\(12\\) in its prime factorization:  \n\\[\n12 = 2^2 \\cdot 3^1.\n\\]  \nRaising this to the power \\(mn\\) gives:  \n\\[\n12^{mn} = \\left(2^2 \\cdot 3^1\\right)^{mn} = 2^{2mn} \\cdot 3^{mn}.\n\\]  \n\nNow, substitute \\(P = 2^m\\) and \\(Q = 3^n\\) into each option and simplify:  \n\n- **Option E: \\(P^{2n}Q^m\\)**  \n  Substitute \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\):  \n  \\[\n  \\left(2^m\\right)^{2n} \\cdot \\left(3^n\\right)^m = 2^{2mn} \\cdot 3^{mn}.\n  \\]  \n  This matches \\(12^{mn}\\) exactly.  \n\nTo confirm no other option works:  \n- **Option B: \\(P^nQ^m\\)** simplifies to \\(2^{mn} \\cdot 3^{mn} = 6^{mn}\\), which is smaller than \\(12^{mn}\\).  \n- **Option C: \\(P^nQ^{2m}\\)** becomes \\(2^{mn} \\cdot 3^{2mn} = 18^{mn}\\), which is larger.  \n- **Option D: \\(P^{2m}Q^n\\)** results in \\(2^{2m^2} \\cdot 3^{n^2}\\), which depends on \\(m^2\\) and \\(n^2\\), not \\(mn\\).  \n- **Option A: \\(P^2Q\\)** simplifies to \\(2^{2m} \\cdot 3^n\\), which lacks the \\(mn\\) exponent structure.  \n\nThus, **only Option E** correctly reconstructs \\(12^{mn}\\) as \\(2^{2mn} \\cdot 3^{mn}\\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: linarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase h1.h\nm n p q : \u211d\nh\u2080 : p = 2 ^ m\nh\u2081 : q = 3 ^ n\na\u271d : (2 ^ m) ^ (n * 2) * (3 ^ n) ^ m < 12 ^ (m * n)\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nunsolved goals\nm n p q : \u211d\nh\u2080 : p = 2 ^ m\nh\u2081 : q = 3 ^ n\n\u22a2 (2 ^ m) ^ (n * 2) * (3 ^ n) ^ m = 12 ^ (m * n)\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unsolved goals\nm n p q : \u211d\nh\u2080 : p = 2 ^ m\nh\u2081 : q = 3 ^ n\n\u22a2 (2 ^ m) ^ (n * 2) * (3 ^ n) ^ m = 12 ^ (n * m)\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unsolved goals\nm n p q : \u211d\nh\u2080 : p = 2 ^ m\nh\u2081 : q = 3 ^ n\n\u22a2 (2 ^ m) ^ (n * 2) * (3 ^ n) ^ m = 12 ^ (n * m)\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The problem states: \"The sum of 5 consecutive even integers is 4 less than the sum of the first 8 consecutive odd counting numbers. What is the smallest of the even integers? Show that it is 8.\"\n\nFirst, I need to break down what's being asked. We have two parts here: the sum of 5 consecutive even integers and the sum of the first 8 consecutive odd counting numbers. Then, we need to show that the smallest even integer in the first group is 8.\n\nStarting with the sum of 5 consecutive even integers. Let's denote the smallest even integer as x. Since they are consecutive even numbers, the next ones would be x+2, x+4, x+6, and x+8. So the five numbers are x, x+2, x+4, x+6, x+8. The sum of these would be x + (x+2) + (x+4) + (x+6) + (x+8). Let's compute that: adding all the x terms gives 5x, and the constants 2+4+6+8 = 20. So the total sum is 5x + 20.\n\nNow, the other part is the sum of the first 8 consecutive odd counting numbers. \"Counting numbers\" usually refers to positive integers, so the first 8 odd counting numbers would be 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15. Let's verify that's correct. The nth odd number is 2n-1, so for n=1 to 8: 1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15. Their sum can be calculated. The sum of the first n odd numbers is known to be n\u00b2. Wait, that's a formula I remember: 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n-1) = n\u00b2. So for n=8, the sum should be 8\u00b2 = 64. Let me check by adding them up: 1+3=4, 4+5=9, 9+7=16, 16+9=25, 25+11=36, 36+13=49, 49+15=64. Yes, that's correct. So the sum of the first 8 odd numbers is 64.\n\nThe problem states that the sum of the even integers is 4 less than this sum. So, the sum of the evens = 64 - 4 = 60. Therefore, 5x + 20 = 60. Solving for x: subtract 20 from both sides, 5x = 40, so x = 8. That would make the smallest even integer 8. Let me verify this.\n\nIf x=8, the five consecutive even integers are 8,10,12,14,16. Their sum is 8+10=18, 18+12=30, 30+14=44, 44+16=60. Which matches the required sum. And the sum of the first 8 odds is 64, so 60 is indeed 4 less than 64. Therefore, the smallest even integer is 8.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"Show that it is 8.\" So maybe I need to confirm that there's no smaller x that could satisfy this condition. Let's check if x=6 would work. Then the numbers would be 6,8,10,12,14. Sum is 6+8=14, +10=24, +12=36, +14=50. 50 is not equal to 60-4=60. Wait, no, the sum of the evens should be 64-4=60. So 50 is too low. Similarly, x=10 would give 10,12,14,16,18. Sum is 10+12=22, +14=36, +16=52, +18=70. That's 70, which is more than 60. So x=8 is the correct one. Therefore, the answer is 8.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nLet's start by defining the five consecutive even integers. Let the smallest even integer be \\( x \\). Since they are consecutive even numbers, the next four integers are \\( x + 2 \\), \\( x + 4 \\), \\( x + 6 \\), and \\( x + 8 \\). The sum of these five integers is:\n\n\\[\nx + (x + 2) + (x + 4) + (x + 6) + (x + 8) = 5x + 20.\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the first eight consecutive odd counting numbers. These are \\( 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15 \\). The sum of these numbers is known to follow the formula for the sum of the first \\( n \\) odd numbers: \\( n^2 \\). For \\( n = 8 \\), this sum is:\n\n\\[\n1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 + 15 = 8^2 = 64.\n\\]\n\nThe problem states that the sum of the five even integers is \\( 4 \\) less than this total. Thus:\n\n\\[\n5x + 20 = 64 - 4 = 60.\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\n5x = 60 - 20 = 40 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = 8.\n\\]\n\n**Verification:**  \nIf \\( x = 8 \\), the five consecutive even integers are \\( 8, 10, 12, 14, 16 \\). Their sum is:\n\n\\[\n8 + 10 + 12 + 14 + 16 = 60,\n\\]\n\nwhich matches \\( 64 - 4 \\). No smaller even integer satisfies this condition (e.g., \\( x = 6 \\) gives a sum of \\( 50 \\), and \\( x = 10 \\) gives \\( 70 \\)). Therefore, the smallest even integer is indeed \\( 8 \\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: unsolved goals\nk a : \u2115\nh\u2080 : Even a\nh\u2081 : \u2191(\u2211 k \u2208 Finset.range 8, 2 * k + 1) - \u2191(\u2211 k \u2208 Finset.range 5, a + 2 * k) = 4\n\u22a2 False\nunsolved goals\nk a : \u2115\nh\u2080 : Even a\nh\u2081 : \u2191(\u2211 k \u2208 Finset.range 8, 2 * k + 1) - \u2191(\u2211 k \u2208 Finset.range 5, a + 2 * k) = 4\nh\u2082 : \u2211 k \u2208 Finset.range 8, 2 * k + 1 = 64\n\u22a2 2 * k = 20\nno goals to be solved\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unsolved goals\nk a : \u2115\nh\u2080 : Even a\nh\u2081 : \u2191(\u2211 k \u2208 Finset.range 8, 2 * k + 1) - \u2191(\u2211 k \u2208 Finset.range 5, a + 2 * k) = 4\n\u22a2 False\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  64\nk a : \u2115\nh\u2080 : Even a\nh\u2081 : \u2191(\u2211 k \u2208 Finset.range 8, 2 * k + 1) - \u2191(\u2211 k \u2208 Finset.range 5, a + 2 * k) = 4\nh\u2082 : \u2211 k \u2208 Finset.range 8, 2 * k + 1 = 64\n\u22a2 5 * a + 20 = 60\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unsolved goals\nk a : \u2115\nh\u2080 : Even a\nh\u2081 : \u2191(\u2211 k \u2208 Finset.range 8, 2 * k + 1) - \u2191(\u2211 k \u2208 Finset.range 5, a + 2 * k) = 4\n\u22a2 False\nunsolved goals\nk a : \u2115\nh\u2080 : Even a\nh\u2081 : \u2191(\u2211 k \u2208 Finset.range 8, 2 * k + 1) - \u2191(\u2211 k \u2208 Finset.range 5, a + 2 * k) = 4\nh\u2082 : \u2211 k \u2208 Finset.range 8, 2 * k + 1 = 64\n\u22a2 k * 2 = 20\nno goals to be solved\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to show that if |x - 1| + |x| + |x + 1| equals x + 2, then x is between 0 and 1, inclusive. Hmm. Absolute value equations can be tricky because the expressions inside the absolute value can change signs depending on the value of x. So maybe I should consider different cases based on the value of x. Let's think about where the expressions inside the absolute values change their sign.\n\nThe terms are |x - 1|, |x|, and |x + 1|. The critical points where the expressions inside the absolute values are zero are at x = 1, x = 0, and x = -1. So these points divide the real line into intervals. The intervals would be:\n\n1. x < -1\n2. -1 \u2264 x < 0\n3. 0 \u2264 x < 1\n4. x \u2265 1\n\nFor each interval, the expressions inside the absolute values will have consistent signs, so I can remove the absolute values accordingly. Then I can substitute into the equation |x - 1| + |x| + |x + 1| = x + 2 and solve for x in each interval. The solutions must lie within the interval being considered.\n\nLet me start with the first interval: x < -1.\n\nIn this case, x is less than -1. So:\n\n- x - 1 is negative (since x is less than -1, subtracting 1 makes it even smaller), so |x - 1| = -(x - 1) = -x + 1.\n- x is negative, so |x| = -x.\n- x + 1 is also negative (since x < -1, adding 1 gives x + 1 < 0), so |x + 1| = -(x + 1) = -x - 1.\n\nAdding these up: (-x + 1) + (-x) + (-x - 1) = -3x. The equation becomes -3x = x + 2. Solving for x: -3x - x = 2 \u2192 -4x = 2 \u2192 x = -0.5. But wait, this solution x = -0.5 is not in the interval x < -1. So no solution in this interval.\n\nNext interval: -1 \u2264 x < 0.\n\nHere, x is between -1 and 0.\n\n- x - 1 is still negative (since x < 0, x - 1 < -1 < 0), so |x - 1| = -x + 1.\n- x is negative, so |x| = -x.\n- x + 1 is non-negative because x \u2265 -1, so |x + 1| = x + 1.\n\nAdding them up: (-x + 1) + (-x) + (x + 1) = (-x -x + x) + (1 + 1) = (-x) + 2. The equation becomes -x + 2 = x + 2. Solving: -x + 2 = x + 2 \u2192 -x = x \u2192 -2x = 0 \u2192 x = 0. But x = 0 is not in the interval -1 \u2264 x < 0. So no solution here either.\n\nThird interval: 0 \u2264 x < 1.\n\nIn this range:\n\n- x - 1 is negative (since x < 1), so |x - 1| = -x + 1.\n- x is non-negative, so |x| = x.\n- x + 1 is positive (since x \u2265 0), so |x + 1| = x + 1.\n\nSum: (-x + 1) + x + (x + 1) = (-x + x + x) + (1 + 1) = x + 2. So the left side is x + 2, which equals the right side x + 2. So the equation holds for all x in this interval. Therefore, any x between 0 and 1 (including 0 but not 1) satisfies the equation.\n\nFourth interval: x \u2265 1.\n\nHere:\n\n- x - 1 is non-negative (since x \u2265 1), so |x - 1| = x - 1.\n- x is non-negative, so |x| = x.\n- x + 1 is positive, so |x + 1| = x + 1.\n\nSum: (x - 1) + x + (x + 1) = 3x. The equation becomes 3x = x + 2 \u2192 2x = 2 \u2192 x = 1. Now, x = 1 is in the interval x \u2265 1, so this is a valid solution.\n\nPutting it all together: The solutions are x in [0,1) from the third interval and x = 1 from the fourth interval. Combining these, the solution set is 0 \u2264 x \u2264 1.\n\nWait, but in the third interval, x < 1, and in the fourth, x =1. So combining gives 0 \u2264 x \u22641. That's the required conclusion. So the original equation holds exactly when x is between 0 and 1, inclusive.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo determine the values of \\( x \\) satisfying \\( |x - 1| + |x| + |x + 1| = x + 2 \\), we analyze the behavior of the absolute value expressions by splitting the real line into intervals based on critical points where the expressions inside the absolute values change sign: \\( x = -1 \\), \\( x = 0 \\), and \\( x = 1 \\).\n\n1. **Case 1: \\( x < -1 \\)**  \n   All terms inside the absolute values are negative:\n   \\[\n   |x - 1| = -x + 1, \\quad |x| = -x, \\quad |x + 1| = -x - 1.\n   \\]\n   Substituting into the equation:\n   \\[\n   (-x + 1) + (-x) + (-x - 1) = -3x = x + 2 \\implies x = -0.5.\n   \\]\n   But \\( x = -0.5 \\) does not lie in \\( x < -1 \\). **No solution here.**\n\n2. **Case 2: \\( -1 \\leq x < 0 \\)**  \n   \\( x + 1 \\geq 0 \\), but \\( x - 1 < 0 \\) and \\( x < 0 \\):\n   \\[\n   |x - 1| = -x + 1, \\quad |x| = -x, \\quad |x + 1| = x + 1.\n   \\]\n   Substituting:\n   \\[\n   (-x + 1) + (-x) + (x + 1) = -x + 2 = x + 2 \\implies x = 0.\n   \\]\n   But \\( x = 0 \\) is not in \\( -1 \\leq x < 0 \\). **No solution here.**\n\n3. **Case 3: \\( 0 \\leq x < 1 \\)**  \n   \\( x \\geq 0 \\), but \\( x - 1 < 0 \\):\n   \\[\n   |x - 1| = -x + 1, \\quad |x| = x, \\quad |x + 1| = x + 1.\n   \\]\n   Substituting:\n   \\[\n   (-x + 1) + x + (x + 1) = x + 2 = x + 2.\n   \\]\n   The equation holds **for all \\( x \\) in \\( 0 \\leq x < 1 \\)**.\n\n4. **Case 4: \\( x \\geq 1 \\)**  \n   All terms inside the absolute values are non-negative:\n   \\[\n   |x - 1| = x - 1, \\quad |x| = x, \\quad |x + 1| = x + 1.\n   \\]\n   Substituting:\n   \\[\n   (x - 1) + x + (x + 1) = 3x = x + 2 \\implies x = 1.\n   \\]\n   \\( x = 1 \\) is valid in \\( x \\geq 1 \\).\n\n**Conclusion:** Combining the valid solutions from Cases 3 and 4, the equation holds if and only if \\( 0 \\leq x \\leq 1 \\).",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The equation given is a rational equation with three terms. The variable x is in the denominator of each term, so I need to be careful about the domain\u2014specifically, the denominators can't be zero. But first, let me see if there's a substitution that can simplify the equation.\n\nLooking at the denominators: each is a quadratic in x, and they all have the same quadratic term except for the constant. Let's note the denominators:\n\n1. x\u00b2 - 10x - 29\n2. x\u00b2 - 10x - 45\n3. x\u00b2 - 10x - 69\n\nHmm, each denominator is of the form x\u00b2 -10x minus some constant. Let me set y = x\u00b2 -10x. Then each denominator becomes y - 29, y - 45, and y - 69. That substitution might make the equation easier to handle.\n\nSo substituting y = x\u00b2 -10x, the equation becomes:\n\n1/(y - 29) + 1/(y - 45) - 2/(y - 69) = 0\n\nNow, let's rewrite the equation:\n\n1/(y - 29) + 1/(y - 45) = 2/(y - 69)\n\nTo solve for y, I can combine the left-hand side fractions. The common denominator would be (y -29)(y -45). So:\n\n[(y -45) + (y -29)] / [(y -29)(y -45)] = 2/(y -69)\n\nSimplify the numerator:\n\n(2y -74) / [(y -29)(y -45)] = 2/(y -69)\n\nFactor numerator on the left:\n\n2(y -37) / [(y -29)(y -45)] = 2/(y -69)\n\nWe can cancel the 2 from both sides:\n\n(y -37)/[(y -29)(y -45)] = 1/(y -69)\n\nCross-multiplying to eliminate denominators:\n\n(y -37)(y -69) = (y -29)(y -45)\n\nExpand both sides:\n\nLeft side: y\u00b2 -69y -37y + 37*69 = y\u00b2 -106y + 2553\n\nRight side: y\u00b2 -45y -29y + 29*45 = y\u00b2 -74y + 1305\n\nSet left minus right equal to zero:\n\n(y\u00b2 -106y +2553) - (y\u00b2 -74y +1305) = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\n-32y + 1248 = 0\n\nSo, -32y = -1248 \u2192 y = 1248 /32 = 39.\n\nWait, 32*39 = 1248? Let me check: 30*32=960, 9*32=288, 960+288=1248. Yes. So y=39.\n\nBut y was defined as x\u00b2 -10x. So:\n\nx\u00b2 -10x = 39\n\nBring 39 to the left:\n\nx\u00b2 -10x -39 =0\n\nSolve this quadratic equation. Using the quadratic formula:\n\nx = [10 \u00b1 sqrt(100 + 156)] / 2 = [10 \u00b1 sqrt(256)] /2 = [10 \u00b116]/2\n\nSo two solutions:\n\n(10 +16)/2 =26/2=13\n\n(10 -16)/2= -6/2= -3\n\nBut the problem asks for the positive solution, which is 13. So x=13 is the solution.\n\nWait, but I need to check if this solution is valid in the original equation. Because sometimes when we manipulate equations, especially involving denominators, we might introduce extraneous solutions.\n\nSo let's check x=13 in the original denominators:\n\nFirst denominator: x\u00b2 -10x -29. Plugging x=13:\n\n13\u00b2 -10*13 -29 =169 -130 -29= 169-159=10 \u22600. Okay.\n\nSecond denominator: x\u00b2 -10x -45. 169 -130 -45=169-175= -6 \u22600.\n\nThird denominator: x\u00b2 -10x -69. 169 -130 -69=169-199= -30 \u22600. So none of the denominators are zero. So x=13 is valid.\n\nThe other solution was x=-3. Let's check that as well, even though the problem asks for the positive one. x=-3:\n\nFirst denominator: (-3)^2 -10*(-3) -29=9+30-29=10 \u22600.\n\nSecond denominator: 9 +30 -45= -6 \u22600.\n\nThird denominator:9 +30 -69= -30 \u22600. So x=-3 is also valid, but since the problem asks for the positive solution, it's 13.\n\nTherefore, the positive solution is 13, which is written as 013 perhaps in a specific format, maybe leading zero for three digits. But mathematically, it's 13.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo solve the equation \\(\\frac{1}{x^2 - 10x - 29} + \\frac{1}{x^2 - 10x - 45} - \\frac{2}{x^2 - 10x - 69} = 0\\), we start by noticing that all denominators share the quadratic term \\(x^2 - 10x\\). Let\u2019s simplify by substituting \\(y = x^2 - 10x\\). This transforms the equation into:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{y - 29} + \\frac{1}{y - 45} = \\frac{2}{y - 69}.\n\\]\n\nNext, combine the left-hand side fractions over a common denominator:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(y - 45) + (y - 29)}{(y - 29)(y - 45)} = \\frac{2}{y - 69}.\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the numerator gives:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2y - 74}{(y - 29)(y - 45)} = \\frac{2}{y - 69}.\n\\]\n\nFactor out the 2 in the numerator:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2(y - 37)}{(y - 29)(y - 45)} = \\frac{2}{y - 69}.\n\\]\n\nCancel the 2 from both sides:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{y - 37}{(y - 29)(y - 45)} = \\frac{1}{y - 69}.\n\\]\n\nCross-multiplying to eliminate denominators:\n\n\\[\n(y - 37)(y - 69) = (y - 29)(y - 45).\n\\]\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\n- Left: \\(y^2 - 106y + 2553\\)\n- Right: \\(y^2 - 74y + 1305\\)\n\nSubtracting the right side from the left:\n\n\\[\n-32y + 1248 = 0 \\implies y = \\frac{1248}{32} = 39.\n\\]\n\nSubstitute back \\(y = x^2 - 10x\\):\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 10x - 39 = 0.\n\\]\n\nSolve using the quadratic formula \\(x = \\frac{10 \\pm \\sqrt{100 + 156}}{2} = \\frac{10 \\pm 16}{2}\\):\n\n- Positive solution: \\(x = \\frac{26}{2} = 13\\).\n- Negative solution: \\(x = -3\\) (discarded as the problem seeks the positive solution).\n\nFinally, verify \\(x = 13\\) does not make any denominator zero in the original equation. All denominators evaluate to non-zero values, confirming validity. Thus, the positive solution is **13**, written as **013** in the specified format.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  0\nx : \u211d\nh\u2080 : 0 < x\nh\u2081 : x ^ 2 - 10 * x - 29 \u2260 0\nh\u2082 : x ^ 2 - 10 * x - 45 \u2260 0\nh\u2083 : x ^ 2 - 10 * x - 69 \u2260 0\nh\u2084 : 1 / (x ^ 2 - 10 * x - 29) + 1 / (x ^ 2 - 10 * x - 45) - 2 / (x ^ 2 - 10 * x - 69) = 0\ny : \u211d := x ^ 2 - 10 * x\nh\u2085 : y = x ^ 2 - 10 * x\n\u22a2 1 / (y - 29) + 1 / (y - 45) = 2 / (y - 69)\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  2 / (y - 69)\nx : \u211d\nh\u2080 : 0 < x\nh\u2081 : x ^ 2 - 10 * x - 29 \u2260 0\nh\u2082 : x ^ 2 - 10 * x - 45 \u2260 0\nh\u2083 : x ^ 2 - 10 * x - 69 \u2260 0\nh\u2084 : 1 / (x ^ 2 - 10 * x - 29) + 1 / (x ^ 2 - 10 * x - 45) - 2 / (x ^ 2 - 10 * x - 69) = 0\ny : \u211d := x ^ 2 - 10 * x\nh\u2085 : y = x ^ 2 - 10 * x\nh\u2086 : 1 / (y - 29) + 1 / (y - 45) = 2 / (y - 69)\n\u22a2 (y - 37) / ((y - 29) * (y - 45)) = 1 / (y - 69)\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  1 / (y - 69)\nx : \u211d\nh\u2080 : 0 < x\nh\u2081 : x ^ 2 - 10 * x - 29 \u2260 0\nh\u2082 : x ^ 2 - 10 * x - 45 \u2260 0\nh\u2083 : x ^ 2 - 10 * x - 69 \u2260 0\nh\u2084 : 1 / (x ^ 2 - 10 * x - 29) + 1 / (x ^ 2 - 10 * x - 45) - 2 / (x ^ 2 - 10 * x - 69) = 0\ny : \u211d := x ^ 2 - 10 * x\nh\u2085 : y = x ^ 2 - 10 * x\nh\u2086 : 1 / (y - 29) + 1 / (y - 45) = 2 / (y - 69)\nh\u2087 : (y - 37) / ((y - 29) * (y - 45)) = 1 / (y - 69)\n\u22a2 (y - 37) * (y - 69) = (y - 29) * (y - 45)\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  (y - 29) * (y - 45)\nx : \u211d\nh\u2080 : 0 < x\nh\u2081 : x ^ 2 - 10 * x - 29 \u2260 0\nh\u2082 : x ^ 2 - 10 * x - 45 \u2260 0\nh\u2083 : x ^ 2 - 10 * x - 69 \u2260 0\nh\u2084 : 1 / (x ^ 2 - 10 * x - 29) + 1 / (x ^ 2 - 10 * x - 45) - 2 / (x ^ 2 - 10 * x - 69) = 0\ny : \u211d := x ^ 2 - 10 * x\nh\u2085 : y = x ^ 2 - 10 * x\nh\u2086 : 1 / (y - 29) + 1 / (y - 45) = 2 / (y - 69)\nh\u2087 : (y - 37) / ((y - 29) * (y - 45)) = 1 / (y - 69)\nh\u2088 : (y - 37) * (y - 69) = (y - 29) * (y - 45)\n\u22a2 y ^ 2 - 106 * y + 2553 = 0\nunknown identifier 'Quadratic.solve_quadratic_equation_with_positive_discriminant'\nunsolved goals\nx : \u211d\nh\u2080 : 0 < x\nh\u2081 : x ^ 2 - 10 * x - 29 \u2260 0\nh\u2082 : x ^ 2 - 10 * x - 45 \u2260 0\nh\u2083 : x ^ 2 - 10 * x - 69 \u2260 0\nh\u2084 : 1 / (x ^ 2 - 10 * x - 29) + 1 / (x ^ 2 - 10 * x - 45) - 2 / (x ^ 2 - 10 * x - 69) = 0\ny : \u211d := x ^ 2 - 10 * x\nh\u2085 : y = x ^ 2 - 10 * x\nh\u2086 : 1 / (y - 29) + 1 / (y - 45) = 2 / (y - 69)\nh\u2087 : (y - 37) / ((y - 29) * (y - 45)) = 1 / (y - 69)\nh\u2088 : (y - 37) * (y - 69) = (y - 29) * (y - 45)\nh\u2089 : y ^ 2 - 106 * y + 2553 = 0\nh\u2081\u2080 : x ^ 2 - 10 * x = 39\n\u22a2 x ^ 2 - 10 * x - (x ^ 2 - 10 * x) = 0\nunknown identifier 'Quadratic.solve_quadratic_equation_with_positive_discriminant'\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. We need to find two positive whole numbers (so integers greater than 0) whose product is 2005, and neither of them is 1. Then we have to show that their sum is 406.\n\nFirst, let's recall that if two numbers multiply to 2005, they must be factors of 2005. Since neither can be 1, we have to find a pair of factors other than 1 and 2005. But wait, 2005 is a specific number, so maybe it's a prime? If it's prime, then the only factors are 1 and itself, but the problem states neither is 1, which would make this impossible. But the problem says such numbers exist, so 2005 must be composite. Let me check if 2005 is prime.\n\nTo check if 2005 is prime, I can test divisibility by smaller primes. Let's see: 2005 divided by 5 is 401, because 5*401=2005. So 5 and 401 are factors. So the two numbers could be 5 and 401. Their sum would be 5 + 401 = 406. That's the answer we need to show. But wait, the problem says \"the sum of the two numbers\" as if there's only one possible sum. But maybe there are other factor pairs, but the problem states that neither number is 1. Let's confirm that 2005 has only one other factor pair besides 1 and 2005.\n\nWait, 2005 divided by 5 is 401. Is 401 a prime? Let's check. Let's test primes up to sqrt(401) which is about 20. So check 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19. 401 divided by 2 is 200.5, not integer. 401 divided by 3 is 133.666... nope. 5? 401/5=80.2, no. 7? 401/7\u224857.28, no. 11? 401/11\u224836.45, no. 13? 401/13\u224830.84, no. 17? 401/17\u224823.58, no. 19? 401/19\u224821.1, no. So 401 is prime. Therefore, the only factors of 2005 are 1, 5, 401, and 2005. Since the problem says neither number is 1, the only possible pair is 5 and 401. Their sum is 5+401=406. Hence, the answer is 406.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"show that it is 406,\" so maybe there's a need to confirm there are no other factor pairs. Let's make sure there are no other factors. Since 2005=5\u00d7401, and both 5 and 401 are primes, there are no other factors. Therefore, the only possible pair (excluding 1 and 2005) is 5 and 401, sum 406. So the proof is straightforward once you factorize 2005 into primes and identify the only valid pair.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo solve the problem, we need to find two positive whole numbers (greater than 1) that multiply to 2005 and show their sum is 406. Here's how to approach it:\n\n1. **Factorize 2005**:  \n   First, check if 2005 is a prime number. If it were prime, its only factors would be 1 and 2005, but the problem states neither number is 1. Testing divisibility, we find:  \n   - \\(2005 \\div 5 = 401\\), so \\(2005 = 5 \\times 401\\).  \n   - Next, verify if 401 is prime. Testing primes up to \\(\\sqrt{401} \\approx 20\\), we confirm 401 is not divisible by any primes (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19). Thus, 401 is prime.  \n\n2. **Identify valid factors**:  \n   The only factors of 2005 (excluding 1 and 2005) are \\(5\\) and \\(401\\). Since neither number can be 1, the pair must be \\(5\\) and \\(401\\).  \n\n3. **Calculate the sum**:  \n   Adding these factors:  \n   \\[\n   5 + 401 = 406.\n   \\]  \n\n4. **Confirm uniqueness**:  \n   Because 2005 factors uniquely into primes (\\(5 \\times 401\\)), there are no other pairs of integers greater than 1 that multiply to 2005. Thus, the sum **must** be 406.  \n\nThis completes the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: type mismatch\n  h\u2084\nhas type\n  m \u2223 2005 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  m \u2223 401 : Prop\ntype mismatch\n  h\u2085\nhas type\n  n \u2223 2005 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  n \u2223 401 : Prop\nunsolved goals\nm n : \u2115\nh\u2080 : 1 < m\nh\u2081 : 1 < n\nh\u2082 : m * n = 2005\nh\u2084 : m \u2223 2005\nh\u2085 : n \u2223 2005\nh\u2086 : m \u2264 401\nh\u2087 : n \u2264 401\nh\u2089 : m \u2208 divisors 2005\n\u22a2 divisors 2005 = {1, 5, 401, 2005}\ntype mismatch\n  h\u2089\nhas type\n  m \u2208 {1, 5, 401, 2005} : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  m = 5 \u2228 m = 401 : Prop\nunsolved goals\nm n : \u2115\nh\u2080 : 1 < m\nh\u2081 : 1 < n\nh\u2082 : m * n = 2005\nh\u2084 : m \u2223 2005\nh\u2085 : n \u2223 2005\nh\u2086 : m \u2264 401\nh\u2087 : n \u2264 401\nh\u2088 : m = 5 \u2228 m = 401\nh\u2081\u2082 : n \u2208 divisors 2005\n\u22a2 divisors 2005 = {1, 5, 401, 2005}\ntype mismatch\n  h\u2081\u2082\nhas type\n  n \u2208 {1, 5, 401, 2005} : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  n = 5 \u2228 n = 401 : Prop\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase inl.inl\nm n : \u2115\nh\u2080 : 1 < m\nh\u2081 : 1 < n\nh\u2082 : m * n = 2005\nh\u2084 : m \u2223 2005\nh\u2085 : n \u2223 2005\nh\u2086 : m \u2264 401\nh\u2087 : n \u2264 401\nh\u2089 : m = 5\nh\u2081\u2080 : n = 5\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase inr.inr\nm n : \u2115\nh\u2080 : 1 < m\nh\u2081 : 1 < n\nh\u2082 : m * n = 2005\nh\u2084 : m \u2223 2005\nh\u2085 : n \u2223 2005\nh\u2086 : m \u2264 401\nh\u2087 : n \u2264 401\nh\u2089 : m = 401\nh\u2081\u2080 : n = 401\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nno goals to be solved\nno goals to be solved\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: linarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase a\nm n : \u2115\nh\u2080 : 1 < m\nh\u2081 : 1 < n\nh\u2082 : m * n = 2005\na\u271d : m > 401\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase a\nm n : \u2115\nh\u2080 : 1 < m\nh\u2081 : 1 < n\nh\u2082 : m * n = 2005\nh\u2083 : m \u2264 401\na\u271d : n > 401\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\ntype mismatch\n  h\u2082\nhas type\n  m * n = 2005 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  2005 = m * n : Prop\ntype mismatch\n  h\u2082\nhas type\n  m * n = 2005 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  2005 = n * m : Prop\nunknown identifier 'mem_divisors_of_dvd'\nunknown identifier 'mem_divisors_of_dvd'\nunsolved goals\nm n : \u2115\nh\u2080 : 1 < m\nh\u2081 : 1 < n\nh\u2082 : m * n = 2005\nh\u2083 : m \u2264 401\nh\u2084 : n \u2264 401\nh\u2085 : m \u2223 2005\nh\u2086 : n \u2223 2005\nh\u2087 : m \u2208 divisors 2005\nh\u2088 : n \u2208 divisors 2005\n\u22a2 divisors 2005 = {1, 5, 401, 2005}\ntype mismatch\n  h\u2087\nhas type\n  m \u2208 {1, 5, 401, 2005} : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  m = 5 \u2228 m = 401 : Prop\nunsolved goals\nm n : \u2115\nh\u2080 : 1 < m\nh\u2081 : 1 < n\nh\u2082 : m * n = 2005\nh\u2083 : m \u2264 401\nh\u2084 : n \u2264 401\nh\u2085 : m \u2223 2005\nh\u2086 : n \u2223 2005\nh\u2087 : m \u2208 divisors 2005\nh\u2088 : n \u2208 divisors 2005\nh\u2089 : m = 5 \u2228 m = 401\n\u22a2 divisors 2005 = {1, 5, 401, 2005}\ntype mismatch\n  h\u2088\nhas type\n  n \u2208 {1, 5, 401, 2005} : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  n = 5 \u2228 n = 401 : Prop\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase inl.inl.h1.h\nm n : \u2115\nh\u2080 : 1 < m\nh\u2081 : 1 < n\nh\u2082 : m * n = 2005\nh\u2083 : m \u2264 401\nh\u2084 : n \u2264 401\nh\u2085 : m \u2223 2005\nh\u2086 : n \u2223 2005\nh\u2087 : m \u2208 divisors 2005\nh\u2088 : n \u2208 divisors 2005\nh\u2089 : m = 5\nh\u2081\u2080 : n = 5\na\u271d : m + n < 406\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase inr.inr.h2.h\nm n : \u2115\nh\u2080 : 1 < m\nh\u2081 : 1 < n\nh\u2082 : m * n = 2005\nh\u2083 : m \u2264 401\nh\u2084 : n \u2264 401\nh\u2085 : m \u2223 2005\nh\u2086 : n \u2223 2005\nh\u2087 : m \u2208 divisors 2005\nh\u2088 : n \u2208 divisors 2005\nh\u2089 : m = 401\nh\u2081\u2080 : n = 401\na\u271d : 406 < m + n\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: type mismatch\n  h\u2080\nhas type\n  1 < m : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  m \u2223 401 : Prop\ntype mismatch\n  h\u2081\nhas type\n  1 < n : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  n \u2223 401 : Prop\ntype mismatch\n  h\u2082\nhas type\n  m * n = 2005 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  2005 = m * n : Prop\ntype mismatch\n  h\u2082\nhas type\n  m * n = 2005 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  2005 = n * m : Prop\nunknown identifier 'divisors'\nunsolved goals\nm n : \u2115\nh\u2080 : 1 < m\nh\u2081 : 1 < n\nh\u2082 : m * n = 2005\nh\u2083 : m \u2264 401\nh\u2084 : n \u2264 401\nh\u2085 : m \u2223 2005\nh\u2086 : n \u2223 2005\n\u22a2 m + n = 406\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is asking to show that if n = 11, then (1/4)^(n+1) multiplied by 2^(2n) equals 1/4. Hmm. Alright, first, I need to substitute n with 11 and compute the expression, but maybe there's a general approach here that works for any n, not just 11. Let me think.\n\nSo the expression is (1/4)^(n+1) * 2^(2n). Let's break down the components. The term (1/4) can be written as 2^(-2) because 4 is 2 squared. So (1/4) is 2 to the power of -2. Therefore, (1/4)^(n+1) is the same as (2^(-2))^(n+1). When you raise a power to another power, you multiply the exponents. So that becomes 2^(-2*(n+1)).\n\nThen, the other part is 2^(2n). So the entire expression is 2^(-2(n+1)) * 2^(2n). When multiplying exponents with the same base, you add the exponents. So combining these, we get 2^(-2(n+1) + 2n). Let's compute the exponent: -2(n+1) + 2n. Distribute the -2: -2n -2 + 2n. The -2n and +2n cancel each other out, leaving just -2. So the exponent is -2. Therefore, the expression simplifies to 2^(-2), which is 1/4.\n\nWait, but the problem states n = 11. But in this general approach, the n cancels out, meaning that regardless of the value of n, the expression always simplifies to 1/4. So even if n is 11, the result is still 1/4. That makes sense. Let me check with n=11 specifically to confirm.\n\nPlugging n=11 into the original expression: (1/4)^(12) * 2^(22). Let's compute each part. (1/4)^12 is (2^-2)^12 = 2^(-24). 2^22 is 2^22. Multiplying them gives 2^(-24 + 22) = 2^(-2) = 1/4. Yep, that checks out. So the key insight is recognizing that the exponents can be rewritten with the same base and then combined, leading to cancellation of the variable n. Therefore, the expression simplifies to 1/4 for any n, including 11.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nLet's start by simplifying the expression \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^{n+1} \\cdot 2^{2n}\\) step by step. First, notice that \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) can be rewritten as \\(2^{-2}\\) because \\(4 = 2^2\\). Substituting this into the expression gives:\n\n\\[\n\\left(2^{-2}\\right)^{n+1} \\cdot 2^{2n}.\n\\]\n\nWhen raising a power to another exponent, we multiply the exponents. Applying this rule to the first term:\n\n\\[\n2^{-2(n+1)} \\cdot 2^{2n}.\n\\]\n\nNext, combine the terms by adding their exponents (since they share the same base \\(2\\)):\n\n\\[\n2^{-2(n+1) + 2n}.\n\\]\n\nSimplify the exponent:\n\n\\[\n-2(n+1) + 2n = -2n - 2 + 2n = -2.\n\\]\n\nThis reduces the expression to:\n\n\\[\n2^{-2} = \\frac{1}{2^2} = \\frac{1}{4}.\n\\]\n\nCrucially, the variable \\(n\\) cancels out during simplification. This means the result \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) holds **for any integer** \\(n\\), including \\(n = 11\\). To verify, substitute \\(n = 11\\) directly:\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^{12} \\cdot 2^{22} = 2^{-24} \\cdot 2^{22} = 2^{-2} = \\frac{1}{4}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the expression simplifies to \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) regardless of the value of \\(n\\), as long as the algebraic rules of exponents are properly applied.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to prove that xyz equals 1 given these three equations. The problem is similar to systems of equations where you have variables linked together. The context given earlier involved solving for variables using ratios and substitution, so maybe similar techniques apply here.\n\nFirst, let's write down the equations again to have them clear:\n\n1. x + 1/y = 4\n2. y + 1/z = 1\n3. z + 1/x = 7/3\n\nThe goal is to find xyz. Hmm. Since we have three equations and three variables, maybe substitution can work. Let's see if we can express each variable in terms of the next and then multiply them together.\n\nStarting with the first equation: x = 4 - 1/y. Similarly, from the second equation: y = 1 - 1/z. From the third: z = 7/3 - 1/x.\n\nIf I substitute these expressions into each other, maybe I can find a relationship. Let's try substituting y from the second equation into the first. So x = 4 - 1/(1 - 1/z). That looks a bit complicated. Let's see if there's another way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply all three equations together. Let's see:\n\n(x + 1/y)(y + 1/z)(z + 1/x) = 4 * 1 * (7/3) = 28/3.\n\nExpanding the left side might be messy, but perhaps some terms will cancel out. Let's try expanding step by step.\n\nFirst, multiply the first two equations:\n\n(x + 1/y)(y + 1/z) = x*y + x*(1/z) + (1/y)*y + (1/y)*(1/z) = xy + x/z + 1 + 1/(yz).\n\nThen multiply this by the third equation (z + 1/x):\n\n[xy + x/z + 1 + 1/(yz)] * (z + 1/x).\n\nThis will result in multiple terms. Let's expand each part:\n\n1. xy * z = xyz\n2. xy * (1/x) = y\n3. (x/z) * z = x\n4. (x/z) * (1/x) = 1/z\n5. 1 * z = z\n6. 1 * (1/x) = 1/x\n7. (1/(yz)) * z = 1/y\n8. (1/(yz)) * (1/x) = 1/(xyz)\n\nSo combining all these terms:\n\nxyz + y + x + 1/z + z + 1/x + 1/y + 1/(xyz) = 28/3.\n\nHmm, that seems complicated. But maybe we can use the original equations to substitute some terms. Let's recall:\n\nFrom equation 1: x + 1/y = 4 \u21d2 x = 4 - 1/y \u21d2 1/x = 1/(4 - 1/y). Not sure if helpful.\n\nWait, maybe let's denote S = xyz. If we can find S, that's our answer. Let's see if we can express terms in terms of S.\n\nLooking at the expanded product:\n\nxyz + y + x + 1/z + z + 1/x + 1/y + 1/(xyz) = 28/3.\n\nLet's substitute S = xyz. Then 1/(xyz) = 1/S. So:\n\nS + y + x + 1/z + z + 1/x + 1/y + 1/S = 28/3.\n\nNow, let's see if we can express the other terms using the original equations.\n\nFrom equation 1: x + 1/y = 4 \u21d2 1/y = 4 - x \u21d2 y = 1/(4 - x). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, from equation 2: y = 1 - 1/z \u21d2 1/z = 1 - y.\n\nFrom equation 3: z = 7/3 - 1/x \u21d2 1/x = 7/3 - z.\n\nWait, maybe substitute these into the terms:\n\n1/z = 1 - y (from equation 2)\n\n1/x = 7/3 - z (from equation 3)\n\nSimilarly, from equation 1: 1/y = 4 - x.\n\nSo let's replace 1/z, 1/x, and 1/y in the expanded equation:\n\nS + y + x + (1 - y) + z + (7/3 - z) + (4 - x) + 1/S = 28/3.\n\nNow, let's simplify term by term:\n\nS + y + x + 1 - y + z + 7/3 - z + 4 - x + 1/S = 28/3.\n\nSimplify:\n\nS + [y - y] + [x - x] + [z - z] + 1 + 7/3 + 4 + 1/S = 28/3.\n\nSo the variables cancel out:\n\nS + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 7/3 + 4 + 1/S = 28/3.\n\nCombine the constants:\n\n1 + 4 = 5. 5 + 7/3 = 15/3 + 7/3 = 22/3.\n\nSo:\n\nS + 22/3 + 1/S = 28/3.\n\nSubtract 22/3 from both sides:\n\nS + 1/S = 28/3 - 22/3 = 6/3 = 2.\n\nSo we have S + 1/S = 2.\n\nMultiply both sides by S to eliminate the fraction:\n\nS^2 + 1 = 2S.\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\nS^2 - 2S + 1 = 0.\n\nFactor:\n\n(S - 1)^2 = 0 \u21d2 S = 1.\n\nTherefore, xyz = 1. So the answer is 1, which is option B.\n\nWait, that worked out! Let me check if I made any mistakes in substitution.\n\nWhen I substituted 1/z = 1 - y, 1/x = 7/3 - z, and 1/y = 4 - x, then replaced them in the expanded equation. Then when simplifying, the variables canceled out correctly. Then combining constants: 1 + 7/3 + 4. Wait, 1 is from 1/z term, 7/3 from 1/x term, and 4 from 1/y term? Wait, no. Wait, let's retrace:\n\nOriginal substitution:\n\n1/z = 1 - y (from equation 2)\n\n1/x = 7/3 - z (from equation 3)\n\n1/y = 4 - x (from equation 1)\n\nBut in the expanded equation, the terms were:\n\n1/z, 1/x, 1/y. So replacing those:\n\n1/z = 1 - y\n\n1/x = 7/3 - z\n\n1/y = 4 - x\n\nSo when substituting into the expanded equation:\n\nS + y + x + (1 - y) + z + (7/3 - z) + (4 - x) + 1/S.\n\nThen combining like terms:\n\ny - y cancels, x - x cancels, z - z cancels. Then constants: 1 + 7/3 + 4.\n\nYes, 1 from (1 - y) term, 7/3 from (7/3 - z) term, and 4 from (4 - x) term. So 1 + 4 = 5, 5 + 7/3 = 22/3. Then S + 22/3 + 1/S = 28/3. Subtract 22/3: S + 1/S = 2. Solving gives S=1. That seems correct.\n\nSo the key idea was multiplying all three equations together, expanding, and then substituting the expressions for 1/x, 1/y, 1/z from the original equations to simplify. Then solving the resulting equation for S=xyz. That's clever. I think this approach works.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nLet's start with the given system of equations:\n\n1. \\( x + \\frac{1}{y} = 4 \\)\n2. \\( y + \\frac{1}{z} = 1 \\)\n3. \\( z + \\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{7}{3} \\)\n\nOur goal is to find \\( xyz \\).

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to evaluate (i/2) squared and show that it's equal to -1/4. Hmm, starting with the basics. Remember that i is the imaginary unit, defined by i\u00b2 = -1. So, squaring i would give -1. But here, it's (i divided by 2) squared.\n\nFirst, let me recall how to square a fraction. If I have (a/b)\u00b2, that's the same as a\u00b2 divided by b\u00b2. So applying that here, (i/2)\u00b2 should be i\u00b2 divided by 2\u00b2. Let's compute each part. The numerator is i squared, which is -1. The denominator is 2 squared, which is 4. So putting them together, that's -1 over 4, which is -1/4. That seems straightforward.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check if there's another way to approach this. Sometimes with complex numbers, you have to be careful with operations. Let me expand the square step by step. (i/2) squared is the same as (i/2) multiplied by (i/2). Multiplying the numerators: i times i is i\u00b2. Multiplying the denominators: 2 times 2 is 4. So again, i\u00b2/4 is -1/4. Yep, same result.\n\nIs there any chance I made a mistake here? Let me think. The key step is squaring i. Since i\u00b2 is -1, that part is correct. Then dividing by 4, which is straightforward. No, this seems right. Maybe the problem is testing understanding of squaring complex numbers, especially when they're fractions. But in this case, since the denominator is a real number (2), squaring it just squares both the numerator and denominator separately. So the answer should indeed be -1/4. I don't see any complications here. The context example involved more complex operations with conjugates and combining terms, but this problem is simpler. Just basic exponent rules and knowing i squared equals negative one. Alright, I think that's solid.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo evaluate \\(\\left(\\frac{i}{2}\\right)^2\\), we start by recalling that squaring a fraction involves squaring both the numerator and the denominator separately. This means:\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{i}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{i^2}{2^2}.\n\\]\n\nNext, compute \\(i^2\\). By definition, the imaginary unit \\(i\\) satisfies \\(i^2 = -1\\). Substituting this into the expression gives:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{i^2}{2^2} = \\frac{-1}{4}.\n\\]\n\nSimplifying further, this equals \\(-\\frac{1}{4}\\). \n\nTo verify, we can also expand the square directly:\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{i}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{i}{2}\\right) = \\frac{i \\cdot i}{2 \\cdot 2} = \\frac{i^2}{4} = \\frac{-1}{4}.\n\\]\n\nBoth approaches confirm that \\(\\left(\\frac{i}{2}\\right)^2 = -\\frac{1}{4}\\). The result follows directly from the properties of exponents and the definition of \\(i\\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  ?a ^ 2\n\u22a2 -1 / 2 ^ 2 = -1 / 4\nunsolved goals\ncase calc.step\n\u22a2 -1 / 4 = -(1 / 4)\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The function given is f(x) = |x - p| + |x - 15| + |x - p - 15|, and we need to find its minimum value on the interval p \u2264 x \u2264 15, where 0 < p < 15. The answer is supposed to be 15, so I need to show that the minimum value of f(x) in this interval is indeed 15.\n\nFirst, I remember that the sum of absolute value functions often has its minimum at a median point or at one of the endpoints. Since absolute value functions are V-shaped, their sum will have corners at the points where each individual absolute value expression changes its slope, which are the points p, 15, and p+15. But wait, the interval we're considering is from p to 15. Since p is between 0 and 15, p+15 would be between 15 and 30. However, our x is only going up to 15, so the point p+15 is outside the interval we're looking at. That might simplify things because within [p, 15], the term |x - (p+15)| will behave like (p+15 - x) since x is less than or equal to 15, and p+15 is greater than 15. So that term is decreasing over the interval.\n\nLet me break down each term:\n\n1. |x - p|: Since x is between p and 15, this becomes x - p, which is increasing because as x increases, the value increases.\n2. |x - 15|: Since x \u2264 15, this becomes 15 - x, which is decreasing as x increases.\n3. |x - (p+15)|: As x \u226415 < p+15 (since p>0), this becomes (p+15) - x, which is also decreasing as x increases.\n\nSo, f(x) = (x - p) + (15 - x) + (p +15 - x). Let's simplify that:\n\nCombine the terms: (x - p) + (15 - x) = 15 - p. Then add the third term: 15 - p + (p +15 - x) = 15 - p + p +15 - x = 30 - x.\n\nWait, that simplifies to 30 - x. But that seems too straightforward. If f(x) simplifies to 30 - x on the interval [p, 15], then since x is between p and 15, the minimum would occur at the maximum x, which is 15. Then f(15) would be 30 -15 =15. So the minimum is 15. But is this correct?\n\nWait, let me check the algebra again. Let's re-express each term step by step.\n\nFor x in [p,15]:\n\n|x - p| = x - p (since x \u2265 p)\n|x -15| = 15 - x (since x \u226415)\n|x - (p+15)| = p +15 - x (since x \u226415 < p+15)\n\nSo f(x) = (x - p) + (15 - x) + (p +15 - x)\n\nCombine the terms:\n\n(x - p) + (15 - x) = x - p +15 -x = 15 - p\n\nThen add the third term: 15 - p + p +15 -x = 15 - p + p +15 -x = 30 -x\n\nYes, that's correct. So f(x) simplifies to 30 - x on the interval [p,15]. Therefore, since x is between p and 15, the function f(x) is 30 - x, which is a linear function decreasing as x increases. Wait, but 30 - x decreases as x increases. So the minimum value would be achieved at the maximum x, which is 15. Therefore, f(15) =30 -15=15. Hence, the minimum is 15.\n\nBut wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check if there's a mistake in the simplification. Let me substitute x=15 into the original function:\n\nf(15) = |15 - p| + |15 -15| + |15 - p -15| = |15-p| + 0 + | -p | = (15 - p) +0 + p =15. Yes, that works. Similarly, if x=p, then f(p)= |p -p| + |p -15| + |p - p -15| =0 + (15 -p) + | -15 | =0 + (15 -p) +15=30 -p. Which is larger than 15 since p is between 0 and15. So indeed, the function decreases from 30 -p at x=p to 15 at x=15. Therefore, the minimum is 15.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"Show that it is 015.\" Maybe that's a typo and they meant 15. So the answer is 15.\n\nBut let me think again. Maybe there's a different approach. Suppose I didn't simplify the expression. Let's consider the function f(x) as the sum of three absolute values. The points where the individual terms change their behavior (i.e., the critical points) are at x=p, x=15, and x=p+15. But in the interval [p,15], the critical points inside the interval are only x=p and x=15. Wait, x=p is the left endpoint, and x=15 is the right endpoint. The third critical point x=p+15 is outside the interval. So within [p,15], the function f(x) is differentiable except at x=p and x=15. But since we're looking at the interval [p,15], maybe the minimum occurs at one of the endpoints or at a point where the derivative changes sign.\n\nBut when we simplified f(x) to 30 -x, which is a linear function with slope -1, decreasing throughout the interval. Therefore, the minimum is at x=15, which gives 15. So that's the proof.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check if there's a point where the derivative is zero. Let's compute the derivative of f(x) in the interval (p,15). Since in this interval, each absolute value term is differentiable except at x=p and x=15. So for x in (p,15):\n\nThe derivative of |x - p| is 1 (since x > p)\nThe derivative of |x -15| is -1 (since x <15)\nThe derivative of |x - (p+15)| is -1 (since x < p+15)\n\nTherefore, f'(x) =1 -1 -1= -1. So the derivative is constant -1 in the interval (p,15). Since the derivative is negative throughout, the function is decreasing on the entire interval. Therefore, the minimum occurs at the right endpoint x=15, giving f(15)=15.\n\nSo both the algebraic simplification and the derivative approach confirm that the minimum is 15. Therefore, the answer is 15.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo determine the minimum value of \\( f(x) = |x - p| + |x - 15| + |x - p - 15| \\) over the interval \\( p \\leq x \\leq 15 \\) (where \\( 0 < p < 15 \\)), we analyze the behavior of the function within this interval.\n\n1. **Simplify the absolute value terms**:\n   - For \\( x \\in [p, 15] \\):\n     - \\( |x - p| = x - p \\) (increasing as \\( x \\) increases).\n     - \\( |x - 15| = 15 - x \\) (decreasing as \\( x \\) increases).\n     - \\( |x - (p + 15)| = p + 15 - x \\) (decreasing as \\( x \\) increases, since \\( p + 15 > 15 \\geq x \\)).\n\n2. **Combine the terms**:\n   \\[\n   f(x) = (x - p) + (15 - x) + (p + 15 - x).\n   \\]\n   Simplifying:\n   \\[\n   f(x) = (x - p + 15 - x) + (p + 15 - x) = (15 - p) + (p + 15 - x) = 30 - x.\n   \\]\n   Thus, \\( f(x) \\) reduces to the linear function \\( 30 - x \\) over \\( [p, 15] \\).\n\n3. **Analyze the simplified function**:\n   - The expression \\( 30 - x \\) is strictly decreasing as \\( x \\) increases. \n   - Therefore, the minimum value of \\( f(x) \\) occurs at the **maximum** value of \\( x \\) in the interval, which is \\( x = 15 \\).\n\n4. **Verify the minimum value**:\n   - At \\( x = 15 \\):\n     \\[\n     f(15) = |15 - p| + |15 - 15| + |15 - p - 15| = (15 - p) + 0 + p = 15.\n     \\]\n   - At \\( x = p \\):\n     \\[\n     f(p) = |p - p| + |p - 15| + |p - p - 15| = 0 + (15 - p) + 15 = 30 - p \\quad (\\text{which is greater than } 15).\n     \\]\n\nSince \\( f(x) \\) decreases linearly from \\( 30 - p \\) at \\( x = p \\) to \\( 15 \\) at \\( x = 15 \\), the minimum value of \\( f(x) \\) over \\( [p, 15] \\) is **15**. This matches the behavior confirmed by both algebraic simplification and derivative analysis.\nPrevious attempt failed with: linarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase inl.inl.a\nx p : \u211d\nf : \u211d \u2192 \u211d\nh\u2080 : 0 < p \u2227 p < 15\nh\u2081 : p \u2264 x \u2227 True\nh\u2082 : f x = x - p + -(x - 15) + |x - p - 15|\nh : x \u2264 p\nh' : x \u2264 15\na\u271d : 15 > x - p + -(x - 15) + |x - p - 15|\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase inr.inl.a\nx p : \u211d\nf : \u211d \u2192 \u211d\nh\u2080 : 0 < p \u2227 p < 15\nh\u2081 : True \u2227 True\nh\u2082 : f x = x - p + -(x - 15) + |x - p - 15|\nh : p \u2264 x\nh' : x \u2264 15\na\u271d : 15 > x - p + -(x - 15) + |x - p - 15|\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase inr.inr.a\nx p : \u211d\nf : \u211d \u2192 \u211d\nh\u2080 : 0 < p \u2227 p < 15\nh\u2081 : True \u2227 x \u2264 15\nh\u2082 : f x = x - p + (x - 15) + |x - p - 15|\nh : p \u2264 x\nh' : 15 \u2264 x\na\u271d : 15 > x - p + (x - 15) + |x - p - 15|\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nunsolved goals\ncase inl.inl\nx p : \u211d\nf : \u211d \u2192 \u211d\nh\u2080 : 0 < p \u2227 p < 15\nh\u2081 : p \u2264 x \u2227 True\nh\u2082 : f x = x - p + -(x - 15) + |x - p - 15|\nh : x \u2264 p\nh' : x \u2264 15\n\u22a2 15 \u2264 x - p + -(x - 15) + |x - p - 15|\n\ncase inr.inl\nx p : \u211d\nf : \u211d \u2192 \u211d\nh\u2080 : 0 < p \u2227 p < 15\nh\u2081 : True \u2227 True\nh\u2082 : f x = x - p + -(x - 15) + |x - p - 15|\nh : p \u2264 x\nh' : x \u2264 15\n\u22a2 15 \u2264 x - p + -(x - 15) + |x - p - 15|\n\ncase inr.inr\nx p : \u211d\nf : \u211d \u2192 \u211d\nh\u2080 : 0 < p \u2227 p < 15\nh\u2081 : True \u2227 x \u2264 15\nh\u2082 : f x = x - p + (x - 15) + |x - p - 15|\nh : p \u2264 x\nh' : 15 \u2264 x\n\u22a2 15 \u2264 x - p + (x - 15) + |x - p - 15|\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: linarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase inl.inl.a\nx p : \u211d\nf : \u211d \u2192 \u211d\nh\u2080 : 0 < p \u2227 p < 15\nh\u2081 : p \u2264 x \u2227 True\nh\u2082 : f x = x - p + -(x - 15) + |x - p - 15|\nh : x \u2264 p\nh' : x \u2264 15\na\u271d : 15 > x - p + -(x - 15) + |x - p - 15|\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase inr.inl.a\nx p : \u211d\nf : \u211d \u2192 \u211d\nh\u2080 : 0 < p \u2227 p < 15\nh\u2081 : True \u2227 True\nh\u2082 : f x = x - p + -(x - 15) + |x - p - 15|\nh : p \u2264 x\nh' : x \u2264 15\na\u271d : 15 > x - p + -(x - 15) + |x - p - 15|\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase inr.inr.a\nx p : \u211d\nf : \u211d \u2192 \u211d\nh\u2080 : 0 < p \u2227 p < 15\nh\u2081 : True \u2227 x \u2264 15\nh\u2082 : f x = x - p + (x - 15) + |x - p - 15|\nh : p \u2264 x\nh' : 15 \u2264 x\na\u271d : 15 > x - p + (x - 15) + |x - p - 15|\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nunsolved goals\ncase inl.inl\nx p : \u211d\nf : \u211d \u2192 \u211d\nh\u2080 : 0 < p \u2227 p < 15\nh\u2081 : p \u2264 x \u2227 True\nh\u2082 : f x = x - p + -(x - 15) + |x - p - 15|\nh : x \u2264 p\nh' : x \u2264 15\n\u22a2 15 \u2264 x - p + -(x - 15) + |x - p - 15|\n\ncase inr.inl\nx p : \u211d\nf : \u211d \u2192 \u211d\nh\u2080 : 0 < p \u2227 p < 15\nh\u2081 : True \u2227 True\nh\u2082 : f x = x - p + -(x - 15) + |x - p - 15|\nh : p \u2264 x\nh' : x \u2264 15\n\u22a2 15 \u2264 x - p + -(x - 15) + |x - p - 15|\n\ncase inr.inr\nx p : \u211d\nf : \u211d \u2192 \u211d\nh\u2080 : 0 < p \u2227 p < 15\nh\u2081 : True \u2227 x \u2264 15\nh\u2082 : f x = x - p + (x - 15) + |x - p - 15|\nh : p \u2264 x\nh' : 15 \u2264 x\n\u22a2 15 \u2264 x - p + (x - 15) + |x - p - 15|\nPlease revise the proof.",

The definition of a star b is ( (1/b - 1/a) ) divided by (a - b). So first, I need to substitute a = 3 and b = 11 into this expression.\n\nWait, let me write that out step by step. The expression is [ (1/b - 1/a) ] / (a - b). Plugging in a=3 and b=11, that becomes [ (1/11 - 1/3) ] divided by (3 - 11). Let me compute the numerator first. 1/11 minus 1/3. To subtract these fractions, they need a common denominator. The denominators are 11 and 3, so the least common denominator is 33. Converting each fraction: 1/11 is 3/33 and 1/3 is 11/33. So 3/33 - 11/33 is (3 - 11)/33 = -8/33. So the numerator is -8/33.\n\nNow the denominator of the entire expression is (3 - 11) which is -8. So now the entire expression becomes (-8/33) divided by (-8). Dividing by -8 is the same as multiplying by -1/8. So (-8/33) * (-1/8). The negatives cancel out, giving (8/33)*(1/8). The 8s cancel, leaving 1/33. So the result is 1/33. That matches what we needed to show. Let me check each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The numerator calculation: yes, converting to 33 as denominator. Subtraction gives -8/33. Denominator is -8. Then dividing two negatives gives positive, and the 8s cancel. Yep, looks correct. So the answer is indeed 1/33.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo compute \\( 3 \\star 11 \\) using the given operation \\( a \\star b = \\dfrac{\\left(\\dfrac{1}{b} - \\dfrac{1}{a}\\right)}{(a - b)} \\), we substitute \\( a = 3 \\) and \\( b = 11 \\):\n\n1. **Compute the numerator**:  \n   \\[\n   \\dfrac{1}{11} - \\dfrac{1}{3} = \\dfrac{3}{33} - \\dfrac{11}{33} = \\dfrac{3 - 11}{33} = -\\dfrac{8}{33}.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Compute the denominator**:  \n   \\[\n   a - b = 3 - 11 = -8.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine numerator and denominator**:  \n   \\[\n   3 \\star 11 = \\dfrac{-\\dfrac{8}{33}}{-8} = \\dfrac{-8}{33} \\times \\dfrac{1}{-8} = \\dfrac{8}{33 \\times 8} = \\dfrac{1}{33}.\n   \\]\n\nThe negative signs cancel, and the \\( 8 \\) in the numerator and denominator simplifies, leaving \\( \\dfrac{1}{33} \\).

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is about finding the positive integer N where the function f(n) = d(n)/n^(1/3) reaches its maximum value, and then finding the sum of the digits of this N. The answer choices suggest the sum is between 5 and 9, with the correct answer being E) 9. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what the divisor function d(n) does. It counts how many positive integers divide n. For example, d(1)=1 because only 1 divides 1, d(2)=2 (1 and 2), and d(12)=6 (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12). The function f(n) is then the ratio of the number of divisors to the cube root of n. We need to find the N that maximizes this ratio.\n\nSince we're dealing with maximizing d(n)/n^(1/3), it's a balance between having a high number of divisors and not growing n too quickly. Numbers with many divisors relative to their size are likely candidates. These are typically numbers with many prime factors, especially small primes raised to appropriate powers.\n\nLet me think about how the divisor function works. The formula for d(n) when n is factored into primes as n = p\u2081^a\u2081 * p\u2082^a\u2082 * ... * p_k^a_k is d(n) = (a\u2081 + 1)(a\u2082 + 1)...(a_k + 1). So to maximize d(n), we want exponents a_i that are as large as possible, but since n itself is in the denominator as n^(1/3), we can't just make n huge. There's a trade-off here.\n\nThe strategy would be to consider numbers with prime factorizations that give a high d(n) without making n too large. Small primes like 2, 3, 5, etc., are better because they contribute more to the divisor count per unit increase in exponent compared to larger primes. For example, 2^3 has d(8)=4, while 3^3 has d(27)=4, but 8 is smaller than 27, so 2 is more efficient here.\n\nSo, perhaps the optimal N will be a product of small primes with exponents chosen such that adding another prime or increasing an exponent still gives a net gain in f(n). Let's try to construct such a number.\n\nLet me start by considering numbers with different factorizations and compute f(n) for them.\n\nFirst, let's check small numbers:\n\nn=1: d(1)=1, f(1)=1/1=1\nn=2: d(2)=2, f(2)=2/2^(1/3) \u2248 2/1.26 \u2248 1.587\nn=3: d(3)=2, f(3)=2/3^(1/3) \u2248 2/1.442 \u2248 1.386\nn=4: d(4)=3, f(4)=3/4^(1/3) \u22483/1.587\u22481.89\nn=5: d(5)=2, f(5)=2/5^(1/3)\u22482/1.710\u22481.169\nn=6: d(6)=4, f(6)=4/6^(1/3)\u22484/1.817\u22482.20\nn=7: d(7)=2, f(7)=2/7^(1/3)\u22482/1.913\u22481.046\nn=8: d(8)=4, f(8)=4/8^(1/3)=4/2=2\nn=9: d(9)=3, f(9)=3/9^(1/3)=3/2.080\u22481.442\nn=10: d(10)=4, f(10)=4/10^(1/3)\u22484/2.154\u22481.857\nn=12: d(12)=6, f(12)=6/12^(1/3)\u22486/2.289\u22482.622\nn=16: d(16)=5, f(16)=5/16^(1/3)\u22485/2.519\u22481.985\nn=18: d(18)=6, f(18)=6/18^(1/3)\u22486/2.620\u22482.29\nn=24: d(24)=8, f(24)=8/24^(1/3)\u22488/2.884\u22482.773\nn=30: d(30)=8, f(30)=8/30^(1/3)\u22488/3.072\u22482.605\nn=36: d(36)=9, f(36)=9/36^(1/3)\u22489/3.301\u22482.726\nn=48: d(48)=10, f(48)=10/48^(1/3)\u224810/3.634\u22482.752\nn=60: d(60)=12, f(60)=12/60^(1/3)\u224812/3.914\u22483.068\nn=64: d(64)=7, f(64)=7/4=1.75\nn=72: d(72)=12, f(72)=12/72^(1/3)=12/4.160\u22482.884\nn=84: d(84)=12, f(84)=12/84^(1/3)\u224812/4.379\u22482.74\nn=90: d(90)=12, f(90)=12/90^(1/3)\u224812/4.481\u22482.678\nn=120: d(120)=16, f(120)=16/120^(1/3)\u224816/4.932\u22483.246\nn=180: d(180)=18, f(180)=18/180^(1/3)\u224818/5.646\u22483.189\nn=210: d(210)=16, f(210)=16/210^(1/3)\u224816/5.943\u22482.693\nn=240: d(240)=20, f(240)=20/240^(1/3)\u224820/6.204\u22483.223\nn=360: d(360)=24, f(360)=24/360^(1/3)\u224824/7.101\u22483.381\nn=420: d(420)=24, f(420)=24/420^(1/3)\u224824/7.49\u22483.206\nn=720: d(720)=30, f(720)=30/720^(1/3)=30/8.957\u22483.35\nn=840: d(840)=32, f(840)=32/840^(1/3)\u224832/9.449\u22483.387\nn=1260: d(1260)=36, f(1260)=36/1260^(1/3)\u224836/10.8\u22483.333\nn=1680: d(1680)=40, f(1680)=40/1680^(1/3)\u224840/11.847\u22483.377\nn=2520: d(2520)=48, f(2520)=48/2520^(1/3)\u224848/13.6\u22483.529\n\nHmm, so as n increases, the divisor count increases, but n^(1/3) also increases. The maximum seems to be around 2520 with f(n)\u22483.529. Let's check higher numbers.\n\nWait, but 2520 is known as the least common multiple of 1-10, which is 2^3 * 3^2 * 5 * 7. Its d(n) is (3+1)(2+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 4*3*2*2=48. So yes, d(2520)=48. Then 48 divided by cube root of 2520. Let me compute 2520^(1/3). Since 13^3=2197, 14^3=2744. So 2520 is between 13^3 and 14^3. Let's approximate: 13.6^3 \u2248 13.6*13.6=184.96, 184.96*13.6\u22482515. So 13.6^3\u22482515, which is close to 2520. So cube root of 2520\u224813.6, so 48/13.6\u22483.529.\n\nBut maybe there's a higher number. Let's check 5040. 5040 is 7! = 2^4 * 3^2 * 5 * 7. So d(5040)=(4+1)(2+1)(1+1)(1+1)=5*3*2*2=60. Then f(5040)=60/5040^(1/3). 5040^(1/3)\u224817.1 (since 17^3=4913, 17.1^3\u224817*17*17.1=4913*1.1\u22485404.3, which is over, so maybe around 17.1). So 60/17.1\u22483.508, which is slightly less than 2520's 3.529. So 5040 is worse.\n\nWhat about 1260? d(1260)=36, cube root of 1260\u224810.8, so 36/10.8\u22483.333. Less than 2520.\n\nHow about 1680? d(1680)=40, cube root\u224811.847, 40/11.847\u22483.377. Still less.\n\nWhat if we take a number with more small prime factors? Let's try 2520 multiplied by 2: 5040, which we saw. What about 2520 multiplied by 3: 7560. Prime factors: 2^3 * 3^3 * 5 * 7. d(n)=(3+1)(3+1)(1+1)(1+1)=4*4*2*2=64. Cube root of 7560\u224820. So 64/20=3.2. Worse.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a number with exponents arranged differently. Let's try 2^4 * 3^3 * 5^2 * 7. Then n=16*27*25*7=16*27=432, 432*25=10800, 10800*7=75600. d(n)=(4+1)(3+1)(2+1)(1+1)=5*4*3*2=120. Cube root of 75600\u224842.3. So f(n)=120/42.3\u22482.837. Worse.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a number with higher exponents on smaller primes. Let's try 2^5 * 3^3 * 5^2 * 7. Then n=32*27*25*7=32*27=864, 864*25=21600, 21600*7=151200. d(n)=(5+1)(3+1)(2+1)(1+1)=6*4*3*2=144. Cube root of 151200\u224853.2. So f(n)=144/53.2\u22482.706. Worse.\n\nHmm, so increasing exponents further increases d(n) but n increases even more, leading to lower f(n). So maybe 2520 is the peak. But wait, let's check numbers between 2520 and 5040. For example, 2520*2=5040, which we saw. What about 2520*2*2=10080. d(10080)= (4+1)(2+1)(1+1)(1+1)(1+1)? Wait, 10080=2^5 * 3^2 *5*7. So d(n)=(5+1)(2+1)(1+1)(1+1)=6*3*2*2=72. Cube root of 10080\u224821.5. So f(n)=72/21.5\u22483.348. Less than 2520's 3.529.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a number with more primes. Let's try including 11. For example, 2520*11=27720. Prime factors: 2^3 *3^2 *5*7*11. d(n)=(3+1)(2+1)(1+1)(1+1)(1+1)=4*3*2*2*2=96. Cube root of 27720\u224830.2. So f(n)=96/30.2\u22483.18. Worse.\n\nWhat if we take a number with more exponents on existing primes but not adding new primes. For example, 2^4 *3^3 *5*7. Then n=16*27*5*7=16*27=432, 432*5=2160, 2160*7=15120. d(n)=(4+1)(3+1)(1+1)(1+1)=5*4*2*2=80. Cube root of 15120\u224824.7. f(n)=80/24.7\u22483.24. Still less than 2520.\n\nWait, maybe there's a number between 2520 and 5040 that's better. Let's see. Let's try 2520*2=5040, which we saw. What about 2520*3=7560, which we checked earlier. Not better. How about 2520*5=12600. Prime factors: 2^3 *3^2 *5^2 *7. d(n)=(3+1)(2+1)(2+1)(1+1)=4*3*3*2=72. Cube root of 12600\u224823.3. f(n)=72/23.3\u22483.09. Worse.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 2520*2*3=15120, which we already considered. Not better.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a number with a different combination of exponents. Let's think. The prime factors of 2520 are 2^3, 3^2, 5^1, 7^1. Suppose we adjust the exponents. For example, 2^4 *3^2 *5*7. Then n=16*9*5*7=16*9=144, 144*5=720, 720*7=5040. Wait, that's 5040 again. So d(n)= (4+1)(2+1)(1+1)(1+1)=5*3*2*2=60. Which we already saw.\n\nAlternatively, 2^3 *3^3 *5*7. Then n=8*27*5*7=8*27=216, 216*5=1080, 1080*7=7560. d(n)=(3+1)(3+1)(1+1)(1+1)=4*4*2*2=64. Cube root\u22487.56 thousand^(1/3)\u224819.6. So f(n)=64/19.6\u22483.265. Still less than 2520.\n\nAlternatively, 2^2 *3^2 *5*7*11. Then n=4*9*5*7*11=4*9=36, 36*5=180, 180*7=1260, 1260*11=13860. d(n)=(2+1)(2+1)(1+1)(1+1)(1+1)=3*3*2*2*2=72. Cube root of 13860\u224824. So f(n)=72/24=3. Less than 2520.\n\nHmm. So far, 2520 seems to be the maximum. But let's check smaller numbers again. Wait, when I checked n=2520, f(n)\u22483.529. What about n=5040, which had f(n)\u22483.508. So 2520 is higher. What about n=1260, which had f(n)=3.333. So 2520 is better.\n\nBut wait, let's check a number between 2520 and 5040. For example, 2520*2=5040, which we saw. What about 2520*1.5=3780. Let's factor 3780. 3780=2^2 *3^3 *5*7. So d(n)=(2+1)(3+1)(1+1)(1+1)=3*4*2*2=48. Cube root of 3780\u224815.56. So f(n)=48/15.56\u22483.085. Less than 2520.\n\nAlternatively, 2520*1.2=3024. Factor 3024: 3024=2^4 *3^3 *7. So d(n)=(4+1)(3+1)(1+1)=5*4*2=40. Cube root of 3024\u224814.45. f(n)=40/14.45\u22482.77. Worse.\n\nHmm. So 2520 seems to be the peak. But wait, let's check n=1680 again. 1680=2^4 *3*5*7. d(n)= (4+1)(1+1)(1+1)(1+1)=5*2*2*2=40. Cube root\u224811.847. So f(n)=40/11.847\u22483.377. Still less than 2520.\n\nWait, but earlier when I checked n=840, which is 2^3 *3*5*7. d(n)= (3+1)(1+1)(1+1)(1+1)=4*2*2*2=32. Cube root\u22489.449. So f(n)=32/9.449\u22483.387. That's higher than 2520's 3.529? Wait, no, 3.387 is less than 3.529. Wait, 3.387 is less than 3.529. So 840's f(n)\u22483.387, 2520\u22483.529. So 2520 is higher.\n\nWait, but let me check n=2520 again. Cube root is about 13.6, so 48/13.6\u22483.529. Correct.\n\nIs there a number with higher f(n) than 2520? Let's check n=5040. As before, f(n)=60/17.1\u22483.508. So 3.508 is less than 3.529. So 2520 is still higher.\n\nWhat about n=720",

The question is about finding a number a = p/q (where p and q are coprime) such that the sum of all real numbers x satisfying the equation floor(x) * fractional_part(x) = a * x\u00b2 is 420. Then we need to find p + q, which is given as option C, 929. So, I need to show why the answer is 929.\n\nFirst, let's parse the equation: floor(x) * fractional_part(x) = a * x\u00b2. Let me recall that floor(x) is the greatest integer less than or equal to x, and fractional_part(x) is x minus floor(x), so it's between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive).

Also, since x = n + {x}, we can write x = n + f, where n is an integer (n \u2265 0, since if n is negative, the fractional part is still positive, but let's check that later) and 0 \u2264 f < 1.\n\nSo substituting x = n + f into the equation, we get n * f = a * (n + f)\u00b2. Our goal is to find all real numbers x (i.e., all pairs (n, f)) that satisfy this equation for some a, and the sum of all such x is 420. Then, from that, find a and hence p + q.\n\nLet me consider each integer part n. For each integer n \u2265 0, we can look for f in [0,1) such that n * f = a * (n + f)\u00b2. Let's rearrange this equation. Let's write it as:\n\nn f = a (n + f)^2\n\nWe can solve for f in terms of n and a. Let's rearrange:\n\na (n + f)^2 - n f = 0\n\nExpanding (n + f)^2: n\u00b2 + 2n f + f\u00b2. So:\n\na(n\u00b2 + 2n f + f\u00b2) - n f = 0\n\nBut maybe it's better to treat this as a quadratic equation in f. Let's rearrange the original equation:\n\nn f = a (n + f)^2\n\nDivide both sides by a (assuming a \u2260 0, which it isn't since it's given as a positive rational number):\n\n(n/a) f = (n + f)^2\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n(n + f)^2 - (n/a) f = 0\n\nExpanding (n + f)^2:\n\nn\u00b2 + 2n f + f\u00b2 - (n/a) f = 0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nn\u00b2 + (2n - n/a) f + f\u00b2 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic in f:\n\nf\u00b2 + [2n - (n/a)] f + n\u00b2 = 0\n\nLet me write that as:\n\nf\u00b2 + n(2 - 1/a) f + n\u00b2 = 0\n\nHmm, solving for f here. Let's denote coefficients:\n\nCoefficient of f\u00b2: 1\n\nCoefficient of f: n(2 - 1/a)\n\nConstant term: n\u00b2\n\nSo quadratic equation: f\u00b2 + n(2 - 1/a) f + n\u00b2 = 0\n\nWe can compute the discriminant D:\n\nD = [n(2 - 1/a)]\u00b2 - 4 * 1 * n\u00b2\n\n= n\u00b2(2 - 1/a)^2 - 4n\u00b2\n\nFactor out n\u00b2:\n\n= n\u00b2 [ (2 - 1/a)^2 - 4 ]\n\nSimplify inside the brackets:\n\n(2 - 1/a)^2 - 4 = 4 - 4/a + 1/a\u00b2 - 4 = -4/a + 1/a\u00b2 = (1 - 4a)/a\u00b2\n\nWait, let's compute step by step:\n\n(2 - 1/a)^2 = 4 - 4/a + 1/a\u00b2\n\nSubtract 4: 4 - 4/a + 1/a\u00b2 - 4 = -4/a + 1/a\u00b2 = (1 - 4a)/a\u00b2\n\nSo D = n\u00b2 * (1 - 4a)/a\u00b2\n\nFor real solutions f, the discriminant must be non-negative:\n\nD \u2265 0 \u21d2 (1 - 4a)/a\u00b2 \u2265 0\n\nSince a is positive (as p and q are positive integers), a\u00b2 is positive. Therefore, the inequality reduces to 1 - 4a \u2265 0 \u21d2 4a \u2264 1 \u21d2 a \u2264 1/4.\n\nSo, a must be \u2264 1/4 for real solutions to exist. That's an important condition.\n\nNow, assuming a \u2264 1/4, the solutions for f are:\n\nf = [ -n(2 - 1/a) \u00b1 sqrt(D) ] / 2\n\nBut let's compute sqrt(D):\n\nsqrt(D) = sqrt(n\u00b2(1 - 4a)/a\u00b2) = n sqrt( (1 - 4a)/a\u00b2 ) = n sqrt(1 - 4a)/a\n\nTherefore, f = [ -n(2 - 1/a) \u00b1 n sqrt(1 - 4a)/a ] / 2\n\nFactor out n:\n\nf = n [ - (2 - 1/a) \u00b1 sqrt(1 - 4a)/a ] / 2\n\nSimplify inside the brackets:\n\nLet me write 2 - 1/a as (2a - 1)/a. Wait:\n\n2 - 1/a = (2a - 1)/a. Let's check:\n\n2 - 1/a = (2a - 1)/a. Yes, because 2a/a - 1/a = (2a -1)/a.\n\nSo:\n\nf = n [ - (2a -1)/a \u00b1 sqrt(1 - 4a)/a ] / 2\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator:\n\n= n [ - (2a -1) \u00b1 sqrt(1 - 4a) ] / (2a)\n\nSo:\n\nf = [ -n(2a -1) \u00b1 n sqrt(1 - 4a) ] / (2a )\n\nFactor out n:\n\nWait, no, n is multiplied by the entire numerator. Wait, let's re-express:\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\nf = [ -n(2a -1) \u00b1 n sqrt(1 - 4a) ] / (2a )\n\nFactor out n in numerator:\n\n= n [ - (2a -1) \u00b1 sqrt(1 - 4a) ] / (2a )\n\nSo f = n [ - (2a -1) \u00b1 sqrt(1 - 4a) ] / (2a )\n\nBut f must be in [0,1). So for each n, we can have up to two solutions for f, but they must satisfy 0 \u2264 f < 1.\n\nMoreover, since a is positive and \u2264 1/4, let's note that sqrt(1 - 4a) is real.\n\nLet me denote sqrt(1 - 4a) as s, where s \u2265 0 (since 1 -4a \u22650). Then:\n\nf = n [ - (2a -1) \u00b1 s ] / (2a )\n\nBut s = sqrt(1 -4a). Let's compute:\n\nLet me compute the two possibilities for f:\n\nCase 1: f_+ = n [ - (2a -1) + s ] / (2a )\n\nCase 2: f_- = n [ - (2a -1) - s ] / (2a )\n\nWe need to check which of these, if any, lie in [0,1).\n\nLet me compute these expressions.\n\nFirst, let's compute the numerator for f_+:\n\n- (2a -1) + s = -2a +1 + sqrt(1 -4a)\n\nSimilarly, for f_-:\n\n- (2a -1) - s = -2a +1 - sqrt(1 -4a)\n\nSo:\n\nf_+ = n [ (-2a +1 + sqrt(1 -4a)) ] / (2a )\n\nf_- = n [ (-2a +1 - sqrt(1 -4a)) ] / (2a )\n\nLet me analyze these expressions.\n\nFirst, note that a \u2264 1/4. Let's consider a = 1/4. Then sqrt(1 -4a) = sqrt(0) = 0. Then:\n\nf_+ = n [ (-2*(1/4) +1 +0 ) ] / (2*(1/4)) = n [ (-0.5 +1) ] / 0.5 = n (0.5)/0.5 = n*1\n\nBut f must be <1, so n*1 <1. Since n is a non-negative integer, n can only be 0. But if n=0, then the original equation becomes 0 * f = a * x\u00b2. Since x =0 + f, x = f. So 0 = a f\u00b2. Which implies f=0. But f is in [0,1), so f=0. But x=0, which is a solution. However, n=0 would lead to x=0. Let's check if that's a valid solution.\n\nBut let's first consider a <1/4. Let's take a general a <1/4.\n\nLet me compute f_+ and f_-.\n\nFirst, let's compute the numerator for f_+:\n\n-2a +1 + sqrt(1 -4a)\n\nSimilarly for f_-:\n\n-2a +1 - sqrt(1 -4a)\n\nLet me denote t = sqrt(1 -4a). Then t >0 since a <1/4.\n\nSo:\n\nNumerator for f_+: -2a +1 + t\n\nNumerator for f_-: -2a +1 - t\n\nBut since t = sqrt(1 -4a), let's see:\n\nNote that 1 -4a = t\u00b2, so 4a =1 - t\u00b2, so a = (1 - t\u00b2)/4.\n\nSubstituting into numerator for f_+:\n\n-2*( (1 - t\u00b2)/4 ) +1 + t = - (1 - t\u00b2)/2 +1 + t = (-1 + t\u00b2)/2 +1 + t = ( (-1 + t\u00b2) + 2 + 2t ) /2 = (t\u00b2 + 2t +1)/2 = (t +1)^2 /2\n\nSimilarly, numerator for f_-:\n\n-2*( (1 - t\u00b2)/4 ) +1 - t = - (1 - t\u00b2)/2 +1 - t = (-1 + t\u00b2)/2 +1 - t = ( (-1 + t\u00b2) + 2 - 2t ) /2 = (t\u00b2 -2t +1)/2 = (t -1)^2 /2\n\nTherefore, f_+ = n * ( (t +1)^2 /2 ) / (2a )\n\nBut a = (1 - t\u00b2)/4, so 2a = (1 - t\u00b2)/2\n\nTherefore, f_+ = n * ( (t +1)^2 /2 ) / ( (1 - t\u00b2)/2 ) ) = n * ( (t +1)^2 / (1 - t\u00b2) )\n\nSimilarly, f_- = n * ( (t -1)^2 /2 ) / ( (1 - t\u00b2)/2 ) ) = n * ( (t -1)^2 / (1 - t\u00b2) )\n\nSimplify these expressions.\n\nFirst, note that 1 - t\u00b2 = (1 - t)(1 + t)\n\nSo for f_+:\n\n(t +1)^2 / (1 - t\u00b2) = (t +1)^2 / [ (1 - t)(1 + t) ) ] = (t +1)/(1 - t )\n\nSimilarly, for f_-:\n\n(t -1)^2 / (1 - t\u00b2) = ( (1 - t)^2 ) / ( (1 - t)(1 + t) ) ) = (1 - t)/(1 + t )\n\nTherefore, f_+ = n * (t +1)/(1 - t )\n\nf_- = n * (1 - t)/(1 + t )\n\nBut t = sqrt(1 -4a). Let's substitute back:\n\nf_+ = n * ( sqrt(1 -4a) +1 ) / (1 - sqrt(1 -4a) )\n\nf_- = n * (1 - sqrt(1 -4a) ) / (1 + sqrt(1 -4a) )\n\nHmm, these expressions look complicated. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider substituting variables. Let me set k = sqrt(1 -4a). Then k = sqrt(1 -4a), so k\u00b2 =1 -4a \u21d2 a = (1 -k\u00b2)/4, where 0 <k \u22641 (since a \u22641/4, so 1 -4a \u22650, and a >0 \u21d2 1 -k\u00b2 >0 \u21d2 k\u00b2 <1 \u21d2 k <1. Wait, if a approaches 0, k approaches 1. If a =1/4, k=0. So k is in [0,1).\n\nSo, substituting a = (1 -k\u00b2)/4, then:\n\nf_+ = n * (k +1)/(1 -k )\n\nf_- = n * (1 -k )/(1 +k )\n\nBut since k is in [0,1), let's see:\n\nFor f_+, denominator 1 -k is positive (since k <1). Numerator k +1 is positive. So f_+ is positive.\n\nFor f_-, numerator 1 -k is positive (since k <1), denominator 1 +k is positive. So f_- is positive.\n\nBut f must be less than 1. So for each n, we need to check if f_+ and/or f_- are in [0,1).\n\nLet's analyze f_+ and f_-.\n\nFirst, let's compute f_+:\n\nf_+ = n*(k +1)/(1 -k )\n\nSimilarly, f_- = n*(1 -k)/(1 +k )\n\nBut since k = sqrt(1 -4a), and a is fixed, k is a constant once a is fixed.\n\nOur goal is to find a such that the sum over all x (i.e., over all n and f) is 420. Each x is n + f, so the sum would be sum_{n} [ (n + f_+) + (n + f_-) ] for each n where f_+ and f_- are valid (i.e., in [0,1)).\n\nBut wait, for each n, there could be 0, 1, or 2 solutions. So we need to find for which n, f_+ and/or f_- are in [0,1).\n\nBut this seems complicated. Maybe there's a pattern or a way to parameterize the solutions.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider specific values. Since the answer is given as 929, which is option C, and 929 is a prime? Wait, 929 divided by, say, 7: 7*132=924, remainder 5. Not sure. Anyway, perhaps the value of a is such that the sum over all solutions x is 420, and we need to find a = p/q, then p + q = 929.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is structured such that for each n, there are two solutions f_+ and f_-, but only for certain n. Then the sum over x would be sum_{n} [ (n + f_+) + (n + f_-) ] = sum_{n} [2n + f_+ + f_- ]\n\nBut perhaps f_+ + f_- can be simplified.\n\nLet me compute f_+ + f_-:\n\nf_+ + f_- = n*(k +1)/(1 -k ) + n*(1 -k)/(1 +k )\n\nFactor out n:\n\n= n [ (k +1)/(1 -k ) + (1 -k)/(1 +k ) ]\n\nCompute the expression inside:\n\nLet me compute:\n\n(k +1)/(1 -k ) + (1 -k)/(1 +k )\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator to combine:\n\n= [ (k +1)^2 + (1 -k)^2 ] / [ (1 -k)(1 +k) ]\n\nExpand numerators:\n\n(k +1)^2 = k\u00b2 + 2k +1\n\n(1 -k)^2 =1 -2k +k\u00b2\n\nSum: k\u00b2 +2k +1 +1 -2k +k\u00b2 = 2k\u00b2 +2\n\nDenominator: (1 -k)(1 +k) =1 -k\u00b2\n\nSo:\n\n[2(k\u00b2 +1)] / (1 -k\u00b2 )\n\nBut k\u00b2 =1 -4a, so:\n\n[2(1 -4a +1)] / (4a ) = [2(2 -4a)] / (4a ) = [4(1 -2a)] /4a = (1 -2a)/a\n\nTherefore, f_+ + f_- = n * (1 -2a)/a\n\nTherefore, the sum over x for a given n (if both f_+ and f_- are valid) would be:\n\nsum_{n} [2n + (1 -2a)/a *n ] = sum_{n} [n(2 + (1 -2a)/a ) ] = sum_{n} [n( (2a +1 -2a)/a ) ] = sum_{n} [n*(1/a) ] = (1/a) sum_{n} n\n\nBut this seems to suggest that if for each n, both solutions are valid, then the total sum would be (1/a) sum_{n} n. However, this can't be correct because the sum of all x would be divergent unless only a finite number of n's are considered. Therefore, there must be constraints on n such that f_+ and f_- are less than 1.\n\nTherefore, for each n, we need to find the values of n for which f_+ <1 and f_- <1.\n\nLet's analyze f_+ and f_-:\n\nRecall that f_+ = n*(k +1)/(1 -k )\n\nf_- = n*(1 -k)/(1 +k )\n\nWhere k = sqrt(1 -4a), 0 <k <1 (since a <1/4)\n\nWe need f_+ <1 and f_- <1.\n\nLet's first consider f_+ <1:\n\nn*(k +1)/(1 -k ) <1 \u21d2 n < (1 -k )/(k +1 )\n\nSimilarly, f_- <1:\n\nn*(1 -k)/(1 +k ) <1 \u21d2 n < (1 +k )/(1 -k )\n\nBut since k is between 0 and1, let's see:\n\nFor f_+:\n\n(1 -k)/(",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem: Find the smallest positive integer N such that 7 + (30 \u00d7 N) is not a prime number, and show that N is 6.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. We have an expression 7 plus 30 times N, and we need to find the smallest N where this result isn't prime. The answer is supposed to be N=6, so I need to verify that for N=1 to 5, the expression gives primes, and for N=6, it doesn't.\n\nLet me start by plugging in N=1. So 7 + 30\u00d71 = 37. Is 37 prime? Yes, it's a prime number. Okay, so N=1 works as prime.\n\nNext, N=2: 7 + 30\u00d72 = 67. 67 is also a prime. So N=2 is still prime.\n\nN=3: 7 + 30\u00d73 = 97. 97 is a prime number. So N=3 is good.\n\nN=4: 7 + 30\u00d74 = 127. Hmm, 127 is a prime as well. So N=4 still gives a prime.\n\nN=5: 7 + 30\u00d75 = 157. Let me check if 157 is prime. Yes, it's a prime number. So N=5 also results in a prime.\n\nNow, N=6: 7 + 30\u00d76 = 7 + 180 = 187. Is 187 prime? Let's check. 187 divided by 11 is 17, because 11\u00d717=187. So 187 is not prime; it factors into 11 and 17. Therefore, N=6 is the first instance where the expression isn't prime.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure there's no smaller N than 6 where this happens. Since N=1 to 5 all give primes, and N=6 gives a composite number, 6 is indeed the smallest such N. That seems straightforward. But maybe I should double-check each step to avoid mistakes.\n\nLet me verify each calculation again:\n\nN=1: 30\u00d71=30; 30+7=37 \u2714\ufe0f prime.\n\nN=2: 30\u00d72=60; 60+7=67 \u2714\ufe0f prime.\n\nN=3: 30\u00d73=90; 90+7=97 \u2714\ufe0f prime.\n\nN=4: 30\u00d74=120; 120+7=127 \u2714\ufe0f prime.\n\nN=5: 30\u00d75=150; 150+7=157 \u2714\ufe0f prime.\n\nN=6: 30\u00d76=180; 180+7=187. Now, 187 \u00f7 11 = 17. So 11\u00d717=187. Definitely composite.\n\nTherefore, N=6 is the smallest positive integer where 7 + 30N is not prime. The key here was checking each N incrementally until we hit a composite result. There's no need to go beyond N=6 since the question asks for the smallest such N. All previous values result in primes, confirming that 6 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo find the smallest positive integer \\( N \\) such that \\( 7 + 30N \\) is not prime, we test successive values of \\( N \\) starting from \\( 1 \\):\n\n1. **For \\( N = 1 \\):**  \n   \\( 7 + 30 \\times 1 = 37 \\), which is prime.  \n\n2. **For \\( N = 2 \\):**  \n   \\( 7 + 30 \\times 2 = 67 \\), which is prime.  \n\n3. **For \\( N = 3 \\):**  \n   \\( 7 + 30 \\times 3 = 97 \\), which is prime.  \n\n4. **For \\( N = 4 \\):**  \n   \\( 7 + 30 \\times 4 = 127 \\), which is prime.  \n\n5. **For \\( N = 5 \\):**  \n   \\( 7 + 30 \\times 5 = 157 \\), which is prime.  \n\n6. **For \\( N = 6 \\):**  \n   \\( 7 + 30 \\times 6 = 187 \\).  \n   Here, \\( 187 = 11 \\times 17 \\), so it is **not prime**.  \n\nSince all values of \\( N \\) from \\( 1 \\) to \\( 5 \\) yield primes, and \\( N = 6 \\) is the first instance where the result is composite, the smallest such \\( N \\) is indeed \\( 6 \\).

But the question isn't asking for the individual values of x\u2081 to x\u2087; instead, it's asking for another specific combination of them. That suggests there's a pattern or a relationship between the equations that we can exploit without solving for each variable individually.\n\nLooking at the coefficients in each equation:\n\nFirst equation: 1\u00b2x\u2081 + 2\u00b2x\u2082 + 3\u00b2x\u2083 + 4\u00b2x\u2084 + 5\u00b2x\u2085 + 6\u00b2x\u2086 + 7\u00b2x\u2087 = 1\n\nSecond equation: 2\u00b2x\u2081 + 3\u00b2x\u2082 + 4\u00b2x\u2083 + 5\u00b2x\u2084 + 6\u00b2x\u2085 + 7\u00b2x\u2086 + 8\u00b2x\u2087 = 12\n\nThird equation: 3\u00b2x\u2081 + 4\u00b2x\u2082 + 5\u00b2x\u2083 + 6\u00b2x\u2084 + 7\u00b2x\u2085 + 8\u00b2x\u2086 + 9\u00b2x\u2087 = 123\n\nAnd the target expression is:\n\n4\u00b2x\u2081 +5\u00b2x\u2082 +6\u00b2x\u2083 +7\u00b2x\u2084 +8\u00b2x\u2085 +9\u00b2x\u2086 +10\u00b2x\u2087 = ?\n\nNotice that each equation's coefficients are consecutive squares shifted by one each time. The first equation starts at 1\u00b2, the second at 2\u00b2, the third at 3\u00b2, and the target starts at 4\u00b2. So there's a progression here. Maybe the equations are part of a sequence where each subsequent equation shifts the squares by one and the right-hand side follows a pattern.\n\nLet me denote the equations as E\u2081, E\u2082, E\u2083, and the target as E\u2084. Let's see:\n\nE\u2081: 1\u00b2x\u2081 +2\u00b2x\u2082 +3\u00b2x\u2083 +4\u00b2x\u2084 +5\u00b2x\u2085 +6\u00b2x\u2086 +7\u00b2x\u2087 = 1\n\nE\u2082: 2\u00b2x\u2081 +3\u00b2x\u2082 +4\u00b2x\u2083 +5\u00b2x\u2084 +6\u00b2x\u2085 +7\u00b2x\u2086 +8\u00b2x\u2087 = 12\n\nE\u2083: 3\u00b2x\u2081 +4\u00b2x\u2082 +5\u00b2x\u2083 +6\u00b2x\u2084 +7\u00b2x\u2085 +8\u00b2x\u2086 +9\u00b2x\u2087 = 123\n\nE\u2084 (target): 4\u00b2x\u2081 +5\u00b2x\u2082 +6\u00b2x\u2083 +7\u00b2x\u2084 +8\u00b2x\u2085 +9\u00b2x\u2086 +10\u00b2x\u2087 = ?\n\nIf we can find a pattern or a recurrence relation between E\u2081, E\u2082, E\u2083, and E\u2084, we might be able to compute E\u2084 based on the previous results. Let's look at the right-hand sides: 1, 12, 123. Let's see if there's a pattern here.\n\nLooking at the differences between the RHS terms:\n\n12 - 1 = 11\n\n123 -12 = 111\n\nSo the differences are 11 and 111. Hmm, 11 and 111. If we look at the next difference, maybe it's 1111? But 123 + 1111 = 1234. But the answer is supposed to be 334. Wait, that might not fit. Alternatively, maybe there's a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each equation is related to the previous ones through some linear combination. Let's see if we can model E\u2082 in terms of E\u2081, and E\u2083 in terms of E\u2082 and E\u2081, and then predict E\u2084.\n\nLet me denote the RHS of E\u2081 as b\u2081=1, E\u2082 as b\u2082=12, E\u2083 as b\u2083=123, and E\u2084 as b\u2084=?\n\nSuppose there's a linear recurrence such that b\u2083 = a*b\u2082 + b*b\u2081 + c, and similarly for b\u2084. Let's try to find coefficients a, b, c such that:\n\n12 = a*1 + b*0 + c (since before E\u2081 there's no equation, but maybe not)\n\nWait, maybe between E\u2081, E\u2082, E\u2083, the differences or ratios can be considered. Let's compute the differences between the RHS:\n\nFrom E\u2081 to E\u2082: 12 -1 =11\n\nFrom E\u2082 to E\u2083:123 -12=111\n\nNow, 11 and 111. Notice that 111 is 10*11 +1? Not exactly. Alternatively, 11*10 +1=111. Hmm, maybe the next difference is 111*10 +1=1111. Then E\u2084 would be 123 +1111=1234. But the answer is supposed to be 334. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the differences themselves have a pattern. 11, 111. The ratio between the second and first difference is 111/11=10.09... which is 10.09, but not an integer. Alternatively, 111 is 11*10 +1. Maybe the next difference is 111*10 + something? Let's see:\n\nIf the first difference is 11, second is 111, which is 11*10 +1. Then maybe the third difference is 111*10 +1=1111. Then E\u2084 would be 123 +1111=1234. But again, that's not 334. So this approach might not be correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the coefficients of the equations relate to each other in a way that allows us to express E\u2084 as a combination of E\u2081, E\u2082, E\u2083. Let's consider the coefficients.\n\nLooking at the coefficients in each equation:\n\nFor E\u2081: the coefficients are (1\u00b2, 2\u00b2, 3\u00b2, 4\u00b2, 5\u00b2, 6\u00b2, 7\u00b2)\n\nE\u2082: (2\u00b2, 3\u00b2, 4\u00b2, 5\u00b2, 6\u00b2, 7\u00b2, 8\u00b2)\n\nE\u2083: (3\u00b2, 4\u00b2, 5\u00b2, 6\u00b2, 7\u00b2, 8\u00b2, 9\u00b2)\n\nE\u2084: (4\u00b2,5\u00b2,6\u00b2,7\u00b2,8\u00b2,9\u00b2,10\u00b2)\n\nSo each equation shifts the squares by one. So E\u2082 is E\u2081 shifted right by one index, and similarly for E\u2083 and E\u2084. This seems like a sequence of equations where each is a shifted version of the previous.\n\nIf we can find a linear combination of E\u2081, E\u2082, E\u2083 that gives E\u2084, then we can use the known RHS values to compute the RHS of E\u2084.\n\nLet me denote the equations as vectors. Let\u2019s think of each equation as a vector of coefficients plus the RHS. Let\u2019s consider the coefficients of x\u2081 to x\u2087 in each equation.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the coefficient matrix rows as:\n\nRow 1 (E\u2081): [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49]\n\nRow 2 (E\u2082): [4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64]\n\nRow 3 (E\u2083): [9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]\n\nTarget row (E\u2084): [16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]\n\nWe need to find scalars a, b, c such that:\n\na*Row1 + b*Row2 + c*Row3 = Row4\n\nIf such a linear combination exists, then the RHS would be a*1 + b*12 + c*123 = desired RHS (which we need to find as 334). So first, let's check if such a linear combination exists.\n\nLet\u2019s write equations for each coefficient position. For each column j (from 1 to 7), the combination a*E\u2081_j + b*E\u2082_j + c*E\u2083_j = E\u2084_j.\n\nLet\u2019s take column 1:\n\na*1 + b*4 + c*9 = 16\n\nColumn 2:\n\na*4 + b*9 + c*16 =25\n\nColumn3:\n\na*9 + b*16 + c*25 =36\n\nSimilarly, column4:\n\na*16 + b*25 + c*36 =49\n\nColumn5:\n\na*25 + b*36 + c*49 =64\n\nColumn6:\n\na*36 + b*49 + c*64 =81\n\nColumn7:\n\na*49 + b*64 + c*81 =100\n\nSo we have seven equations with three variables a, b, c. This seems overdetermined, but maybe there's a solution that satisfies all equations. Let's try to solve the first three equations and see if they satisfy the others.\n\nFirst three equations:\n\n1) a +4b +9c =16\n\n2)4a +9b +16c =25\n\n3)9a +16b +25c =36\n\nLet\u2019s solve this system. Let's write them as:\n\nEquation1: a +4b +9c =16\n\nEquation2:4a +9b +16c =25\n\nEquation3:9a +16b +25c =36\n\nLet\u2019s use elimination. Subtract equation1 multiplied by 4 from equation2:\n\nEquation2 -4*Equation1:\n\n(4a +9b +16c) -4*(a +4b +9c) =25 -4*16\n\n4a +9b +16c -4a -16b -36c =25 -64\n\n(0a) + (-7b) + (-20c) = -39\n\nSo: -7b -20c = -39 \u2192 7b +20c =39 ...(4)\n\nSimilarly, subtract equation2 multiplied by 9/4 from equation3? Maybe better to do equation3 -9*equation1:\n\nEquation3 -9*Equation1:\n\n(9a +16b +25c) -9*(a +4b +9c) =36 -9*16\n\n9a +16b +25c -9a -36b -81c =36 -144\n\n0a -20b -56c = -108\n\nSimplify: -20b -56c = -108 \u2192 Divide both sides by -4: 5b +14c =27 ...(5)\n\nNow we have equations (4) and (5):\n\n(4):7b +20c =39\n\n(5):5b +14c =27\n\nLet\u2019s solve these two equations. Let's use elimination. Multiply equation (4) by 5 and equation (5) by7 to eliminate b:\n\n(4)*5:35b +100c =195\n\n(5)*7:35b +98c =189\n\nSubtract them:\n\n(35b +100c) - (35b +98c) =195 -189\n\n2c =6 \u2192 c=3\n\nThen substitute c=3 into equation (5):\n\n5b +14*3=27 \u21925b +42=27 \u21925b= -15 \u2192b= -3\n\nNow substitute b=-3 and c=3 into equation1:\n\na +4*(-3) +9*3 =16 \u2192a -12 +27=16 \u2192a +15=16 \u2192a=1\n\nSo a=1, b=-3, c=3.\n\nNow let's check if these values satisfy the other equations (columns 4 to 7):\n\nColumn4: a*16 +b*25 +c*36 =1*16 + (-3)*25 +3*36 =16 -75 +108 =49 \u2192 Correct.\n\nColumn5: a*25 +b*36 +c*49 =1*25 + (-3)*36 +3*49 =25 -108 +147 =64 \u2192 Correct.\n\nColumn6: a*36 +b*49 +c*64 =1*36 + (-3)*49 +3*64 =36 -147 +192 =81 \u2192 Correct.\n\nColumn7: a*49 +b*64 +c*81 =1*49 + (-3)*64 +3*81 =49 -192 +243 =100 \u2192 Correct.\n\nGreat! So the coefficients a=1, b=-3, c=3 work for all columns. Therefore, the target equation E\u2084 is equal to 1*E\u2081 -3*E\u2082 +3*E\u2083.\n\nTherefore, the RHS of E\u2084 is 1*1 -3*12 +3*123 =1 -36 +369 = (1 -36) +369 = -35 +369 =334.\n\nHence, the value of 16x\u2081+25x\u2082+36x\u2083+49x\u2084+64x\u2085+81x\u2086+100x\u2087 is indeed 334.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo find the value of \\(16x_1 + 25x_2 + 36x_3 + 49x_4 + 64x_5 + 81x_6 + 100x_7\\), we observe a pattern in the given system of equations. Each equation uses coefficients that are consecutive squares, shifted by one position in subsequent equations. For example:\n- The first equation uses \\(1^2, 2^2, \\dots, 7^2\\),\n- The second uses \\(2^2, 3^2, \\dots, 8^2\\),\n- The third uses \\(3^2, 4^2, \\dots, 9^2\\),\n- The target expression uses \\(4^2, 5^2, \\dots, 10^2\\).\n\nThis suggests a linear relationship between the equations. We hypothesize that the target equation (let\u2019s call it \\(E_4\\)) can be expressed as a combination of the first three equations (\\(E_1, E_2, E_3\\)). Specifically, we look for scalars \\(a, b, c\\) such that:\n\\[\nE_4 = a \\cdot E_1 + b \\cdot E_2 + c \\cdot E_3.\n\\]\nBy matching coefficients for \\(x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_7\\) in \\(E_4\\) with those in the combination \\(aE_1 + bE_2 + cE_3\\), we derive a system of equations. Solving this system, we find:\n\\[\na = 1, \\quad b = -3, \\quad c = 3.\n\\]\nThis means:\n\\[\nE_4 = E_1 - 3E_2 + 3E_3.\n\\]\nSubstituting the right-hand sides of \\(E_1, E_2, E_3\\) (1, 12, and 123, respectively), we compute:\n\\[\n\\text{Value of } E_4 = 1 \\cdot 1 + (-3) \\cdot 12 + 3 \\cdot 123 = 1 - 36 + 369 = 334.\n\\]\nThus, the value of \\(16x_1 + 25x_2 + \\dots + 100x_7\\) is **334**, as required. The key insight lies in recognizing the shifted-square pattern and leveraging linear combinations to bypass solving for individual variables.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the smallest positive integer, other than 1, that is both a perfect cube and a perfect fourth power. The answer is supposed to be 4096, but I need to show why that's the case. Let me start by recalling what perfect cubes and perfect fourth powers are.\n\nA perfect cube is a number that can be written as some integer raised to the power of 3. For example, 8 is 2\u00b3, so it's a perfect cube. Similarly, a perfect fourth power is a number that's an integer to the fourth power, like 16 which is 2\u2074.\n\nSo the problem is asking for the smallest number (greater than 1) that is both a cube and a fourth power. That means the number must satisfy two conditions: it's equal to some integer a\u00b3 and also equal to another integer b\u2074. But since it's the same number, a\u00b3 = b\u2074. Wait, but maybe a and b are the same or different? Hmm, maybe not necessarily. The key is that the number has exponents that are multiples of both 3 and 4. \n\nLet me think about exponents. If a number is both a cube and a fourth power, then its prime factorization must have exponents that are multiples of 3 and 4. For example, take a number like 2^12. The exponent 12 is a multiple of both 3 and 4 because 12 is the least common multiple (LCM) of 3 and 4. So, 12 divided by 3 is 4, and 12 divided by 4 is 3. Therefore, 2^12 would be (2^4)^3 = 16\u00b3 and also (2^3)^4 = 8\u2074. So 2^12 is 4096. That seems to fit.\n\nBut wait, is 4096 the smallest such number? Let me check smaller exponents. The LCM of 3 and 4 is 12, so the smallest exponent that works is 12. So the smallest number would be 2^12, which is 4096. But what about other primes? For example, if we take 3^12, that's a much larger number, so 2^12 is definitely smaller. So 4096 is the smallest when considering prime bases. But what if the number is a composite of primes? Like (2*3)^12? That would be even bigger. So the minimal number must be the smallest prime raised to the 12th power, which is 2^12 = 4096.\n\nBut let me verify this step by step. Let's suppose a number N is both a perfect cube and a perfect fourth power. Then, N can be written as k\u00b3 and also as m\u2074 for some integers k and m. Therefore, k\u00b3 = m\u2074. To find the smallest such N > 1, we need to find the minimal k and m where this equality holds. \n\nAlternatively, we can think of N as a number that is a perfect 12th power. Because the exponents 3 and 4 have LCM 12. So any number that is a 12th power will be both a cube (since 12 is a multiple of 3) and a fourth power (since 12 is a multiple of 4). Therefore, the smallest such number is 2^12, which is 4096. The next one would be 3^12, which is 531441, which is way larger. So 4096 is indeed the smallest.\n\nWait, but why can't there be a smaller number that's a cube and a fourth power without being a 12th power? Let me think. Suppose there's a number N that is both a cube and a fourth power but not a 12th power. Then, in its prime factorization, each exponent must be a multiple of 3 and 4. But the LCM of 3 and 4 is 12, so each exponent must be a multiple of 12. Therefore, N must be a 12th power. Therefore, the smallest such number is indeed the smallest 12th power greater than 1, which is 2^12 = 4096.\n\nSo putting it all together: To be both a cube and a fourth power, the exponents in the prime factorization must be multiples of both 3 and 4. The least common multiple of 3 and 4 is 12, so the exponents must be multiples of 12. The smallest number (other than 1) is when we take the smallest prime (2) raised to the 12th power, which is 4096. Therefore, 4096 is the smallest such number.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo find the smallest positive integer greater than 1 that is both a perfect cube and a perfect fourth power, we need a number that satisfies two conditions: it must be expressible as \\( k^3 \\) for some integer \\( k \\), and as \\( m^4 \\) for some integer \\( m \\). This means the number must have exponents in its prime factorization that are multiples of both 3 and 4.\n\nLet\u2019s analyze the prime factorization of such a number. Suppose \\( N \\) is the smallest number meeting these criteria. For \\( N \\) to be a perfect cube, every prime exponent in its factorization must be a multiple of 3. For it to also be a perfect fourth power, those exponents must simultaneously be multiples of 4. The smallest exponent that satisfies both conditions is the least common multiple (LCM) of 3 and 4, which is 12. Thus, \\( N \\) must be a perfect 12th power.\n\nThe smallest 12th power greater than 1 is obtained by raising the smallest prime number (2) to the 12th power:\n\\[\n2^{12} = 4096.\n\\]\nWe can verify this explicitly:\n- \\( 4096 = 16^3 \\) (since \\( 16 \\times 16 \\times 16 = 4096 \\)), making it a perfect cube.\n- \\( 4096 = 8^4 \\) (since \\( 8 \\times 8 \\times 8 \\times 8 = 4096 \\)), making it a perfect fourth power.\n\nAny smaller candidate would fail to satisfy both conditions. For example, \\( 1 \\) is trivial, and numbers like \\( 64 \\) (which is \\( 4^3 \\) and \\( 2^6 \\)) are not perfect fourth powers. Similarly, \\( 256 \\) (\\( 4^4 \\)) is not a perfect cube. Thus, \\( 4096 \\) is indeed the smallest such number.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown constant 'Nat.le_of_pow_le_pow'\nunknown constant 'Nat.le_of_pow_le_pow'\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  t ^ 3\nn : \u2115\nh\u2080 : 2 \u2264 n\nx t : \u2115\nhx : t ^ 3 = n\nht : t ^ 4 = n\nh : x ^ 3 = t ^ 4\nh3 : x \u2264 t\nh4 : t \u2264 x\nh5 : x = t\n\u22a2 x ^ 3 = 4096\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  n\nn : \u2115\nh\u2080 : 2 \u2264 n\nx : \u2115\nhx : x ^ 3 = n\nt : \u2115\nht : t ^ 4 = n\n\u22a2 x \u2264 t\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  n\nn : \u2115\nh\u2080 : 2 \u2264 n\nx : \u2115\nhx : x ^ 3 = n\nt : \u2115\nht : t ^ 4 = n\nh3 : x \u2264 t\n\u22a2 t \u2264 x\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase intro.intro.a\nn : \u2115\nh\u2080 : 2 \u2264 n\nx t : \u2115\nhx : t ^ 3 = n\nht : t ^ 4 = n\nh3 : x \u2264 t\nh4 : t \u2264 x\nh5 : x = t\na\u271d : 4096 > n\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  n\nn : \u2115\nh\u2080 : 2 \u2264 n\nx : \u2115\nhx : x ^ 3 = n\nt : \u2115\nht : t ^ 4 = n\n\u22a2 x \u2264 t\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  n\nn : \u2115\nh\u2080 : 2 \u2264 n\nx : \u2115\nhx : x ^ 3 = n\nt : \u2115\nht : t ^ 4 = n\nh3 : x \u2264 t\n\u22a2 t \u2264 x\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  t ^ 3\ncase intro.intro\nn : \u2115\nh\u2080 : 2 \u2264 n\nx t : \u2115\nhx : t ^ 3 = n\nht : t ^ 4 = n\nh3 : x \u2264 t\nh4 : t \u2264 x\nh5 : x = t\n\u22a2 4096 \u2264 n\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is to find the equation of the line passing through points B(7, -1) and C(-1, 7), write it in the form y = mx + b, and then compute m + b, which should be 5. Hmm, how do I approach this?\n\nFirst, I remember that the slope of a line through two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is calculated by (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1). Let me apply that here. So, for points B(7, -1) and C(-1, 7), the slope m would be (7 - (-1))/(-1 - 7). That simplifies to (8)/(-8) which is -1. So the slope m is -1.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. The y difference is 7 - (-1) = 8, and the x difference is -1 - 7 = -8. So 8 divided by -8 is indeed -1. Okay, that's correct.\n\nNow that I have the slope, I can use the point-slope form of a line to find the equation. The point-slope form is y - y1 = m(x - x1). Let's pick one of the points. Maybe point B(7, -1). Plugging into the formula: y - (-1) = -1*(x - 7). Simplifying that gives y + 1 = -x + 7. Then subtract 1 from both sides: y = -x + 6. So here, m is -1 and b is 6. Therefore, m + b is -1 + 6 = 5. That matches the answer we needed to show.\n\nAlternatively, I could check using the other point C(-1, 7) to make sure. Using point C: y - 7 = -1*(x - (-1)) \u2192 y - 7 = -1*(x + 1) \u2192 y -7 = -x -1 \u2192 y = -x +6. Same result. So that's consistent.\n\nWait, maybe there's another way using the two-intercept form mentioned in the context. The two-intercept form is x/a + y/b =1, where a and b are the x and y intercepts. But in this problem, the line passes through B(7, -1) and C(-1,7), which aren't intercepts. So maybe that's not directly applicable here. The original problem's context used the two-point form, which is more relevant here. So the two-point form approach seems better here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe solving it using a system of equations. Since the line passes through both points, plugging them into y = mx + b should satisfy the equation. Let's try that. For point B(7, -1): -1 = 7m + b. For point C(-1,7): 7 = -1*m + b. Now we have two equations:\n\n1) 7m + b = -1\n\n2) -m + b = 7\n\nSubtracting equation 2 from equation 1: (7m + b) - (-m + b) = -1 -7 \u2192 7m + b + m - b = -8 \u2192 8m = -8 \u2192 m = -1. Then substitute m = -1 into equation 2: -(-1) + b =7 \u2192 1 + b =7 \u2192 b=6. So again, m + b = -1 +6=5. Yep, same answer. So this confirms it.\n\nI think that's thorough. Checked using two different methods: slope calculation leading to point-slope, and solving the system of equations. Both lead to m=-1 and b=6, so their sum is 5. The problem states to show that it's 5, which we've done. So the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo find the equation of the line passing through points \\( B(7, -1) \\) and \\( C(-1, 7) \\) in the form \\( y = mx + b \\), we start by calculating the slope \\( m \\). The slope between two points \\( (x_1, y_1) \\) and \\( (x_2, y_2) \\) is given by:\n\\[\nm = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}.\n\\]\nSubstituting \\( B(7, -1) \\) and \\( C(-1, 7) \\):\n\\[\nm = \\frac{7 - (-1)}{-1 - 7} = \\frac{8}{-8} = -1.\n\\]\nNow that we know \\( m = -1 \\), we use the point-slope form \\( y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) \\) with one of the points. Using \\( B(7, -1) \\):\n\\[\ny - (-1) = -1(x - 7) \\implies y + 1 = -x + 7 \\implies y = -x + 6.\n\\]\nFrom this equation, \\( m = -1 \\) and \\( b = 6 \\). Adding these gives:\n\\[\nm + b = -1 + 6 = 5.\n\\]\nTo verify, we can substitute the coordinates of \\( C(-1, 7) \\) into \\( y = -x + 6 \\):\n\\[\n7 = -(-1) + 6 \\implies 7 = 1 + 6 \\implies 7 = 7,\n\\]\nconfirming the equation is correct. Thus, \\( m + b = 5 \\).",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. We need to show that if there are positive integers a, b, and k such that 2^k = (a + b\u00b2)(b + a\u00b2), then a must be 1. Hmm, interesting. Let's start by understanding the equation. Both factors on the right side are positive integers since a and b are positive. Since their product is a power of 2, each factor must itself be a power of 2. Because if a product of two numbers is a power of 2, each number must be a power of 2. Otherwise, they would have some prime factor other than 2. So that's a key point.\n\nSo, let's denote (a + b\u00b2) = 2^m and (b + a\u00b2) = 2^n, where m and n are non-negative integers such that m + n = k. Since both factors are at least 1 (because a and b are positive), m and n are at least 0. But since a and b are positive integers, let's see what possible values they can take.\n\nLet's assume a = 1 first. Then the equations become (1 + b\u00b2) and (b + 1). Let's check if these can both be powers of 2. For example, if b = 1: (1 + 1) = 2 and (1 + 1) = 2, so 2*2 = 4 = 2^2. That works. If b = 2: (1 + 4) = 5, which is not a power of 2. So that's invalid. If b = 3: (1 + 9) = 10, not a power of 2. So only b=1 works here. But the problem states that a must be 1, so maybe this is the only solution. But we need to show that a cannot be anything other than 1.\n\nSuppose a \u2265 2. Then let's see what happens. Let's consider the two factors: a + b\u00b2 and b + a\u00b2. Both need to be powers of 2. Let's try small values. Let's take a=2. Then we have (2 + b\u00b2) and (b + 4). Both must be powers of 2. Let's try b=2: (2 +4)=6, not a power of 2. b=1: (2 +1)=3 and (1 +4)=5, neither are powers of 2. b=3: (2 +9)=11, not a power of 2. b=4: (2 +16)=18, not a power of 2. Hmm, seems like no solutions here.\n\nWhat about a=3? Then (3 + b\u00b2) and (b +9). Let's try b=1: (3 +1)=4=2\u00b2 and (1 +9)=10, which is not a power of 2. b=2: (3 +4)=7 and (2 +9)=11, nope. b=3: (3 +9)=12 and (3 +9)=12, not powers of 2. So again, no luck.\n\nMaybe a=4? Then (4 + b\u00b2) and (b +16). Trying b=1: (4 +1)=5 and (1 +16)=17. Nope. b=2: (4 +4)=8=2\u00b3 and (2 +16)=18. 8*18=144=2^4*3\u00b2, which isn't a power of 2. So that's invalid. b=4: (4 +16)=20 and (4 +16)=20. Not powers of 2.\n\nThis pattern suggests that when a \u22652, it's hard to find b such that both factors are powers of 2. Let's try to formalize this.\n\nAssume a \u22652. Then a + b\u00b2 and b + a\u00b2 are both powers of 2. Let's denote a + b\u00b2 = 2^m and b + a\u00b2 = 2^n. Then, since a and b are positive integers, both m and n must be at least 1 (since a \u22651 and b \u22651, so a + b\u00b2 \u22651 +1=2, so m \u22651, similarly for n).\n\nNow, let's subtract the two equations. Let's see:\n\nFrom a + b\u00b2 = 2^m and b + a\u00b2 = 2^n, subtract them: (a + b\u00b2) - (b + a\u00b2) = 2^m - 2^n. Let's rearrange: a - b + b\u00b2 - a\u00b2 = 2^m - 2^n. Factor the left side: (a - b) + (b\u00b2 - a\u00b2) = (a - b) - (a\u00b2 - b\u00b2) = (a - b) - (a - b)(a + b) = (a - b)(1 - (a + b)). So, (a - b)(1 - a - b) = 2^m - 2^n.\n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Maybe there's another approach. Let's consider that both a + b\u00b2 and b + a\u00b2 are powers of 2. Let's assume without loss of generality that m \u2265 n, so 2^m \u2265 2^n. Then, 2^m - 2^n = 2^n(2^{m-n} -1). But from the previous equation, this equals (a - b)(1 - a - b). Not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that a and b are both at least 1. Let's suppose a \u22652 and b \u22652. Then a + b\u00b2 \u22652 +4=6, which would need to be a power of 2. The next power of 2 after 4 is 8. So maybe a + b\u00b2=8. Then possible b\u00b2=6, which isn't a square. Or a=2, b\u00b2=6, which isn't possible. So maybe a=4, b\u00b2=4, so b=2. Then check the other factor: b + a\u00b2=2 +16=18, not a power of 2. So that doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, a + b\u00b2=16. Then possible a=12, b=2 (since 12 +4=16). Then check b + a\u00b2=2 +144=146, not a power of 2. Or a=7, b=3 (7+9=16). Then b +a\u00b2=3 +49=52, nope. Doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe one of the factors is 2 and the other is 2^{k-1}. Let's say a + b\u00b2=2 and b +a\u00b2=2^{k-1}. Then a + b\u00b2=2 implies a=1 and b=1, since both are positive integers. Then b +a\u00b2=1 +1=2, so k-1=1, k=2. So 2^2=4, which matches (1+1)(1+1)=2*2=4. So that's the solution a=1, b=1. But the problem wants to show that a must be 1. So maybe this is the only solution, but the problem states that if there exists such k, then a=1. So perhaps the only possible a is 1.\n\nBut wait, maybe there are other solutions where a=1 and b is different. Let's check. If a=1, then the equation becomes (1 + b\u00b2)(b +1) =2^k. Let's see for b=1: (1+1)(1+1)=4=2^2. That's valid. For b=2: (1+4)(2+1)=5*3=15, not a power of 2. For b=3: (1+9)(3+1)=10*4=40, not a power of 2. For b=4: (1+16)(4+1)=17*5=85, nope. So only b=1 works when a=1. So the only solution is a=1, b=1, k=2. But the problem says \"show that a=1\", implying that a must be 1, and there are no solutions with a>1.\n\nSo how to prove that a must be 1? Let's suppose a \u22652 and reach a contradiction.\n\nAssume a \u22652. Then, as before, both a + b\u00b2 and b +a\u00b2 are powers of 2. Let's denote them as 2^m and 2^n, respectively. Without loss of generality, assume m \u2265n. Then, 2^m - 2^n = (a + b\u00b2) - (b +a\u00b2) = a - b + b\u00b2 -a\u00b2 = (a - b) + (b\u00b2 -a\u00b2) = (a - b) - (a\u00b2 -b\u00b2) = (a - b) - (a -b)(a +b) = (a -b)(1 -a -b).\n\nSo, 2^n(2^{m-n} -1) = (a -b)(1 -a -b). Now, the left side is positive because 2^{m-n} -1 \u22651 since m \u2265n. So the right side must also be positive. Therefore, (a -b)(1 -a -b) >0. Let's analyze the sign.\n\nCase 1: a > b. Then (a -b) >0. So (1 -a -b) must be positive. So 1 -a -b >0 \u2192 a + b <1. But a and b are positive integers, so a + b \u22652 (since a \u22652 and b \u22651). Contradiction.\n\nCase 2: a < b. Then (a -b) <0. So (1 -a -b) must be negative. So 1 -a -b <0 \u2192 a + b >1. Which is always true since a and b are positive integers. So this case is possible.\n\nCase 3: a = b. Then (a -b)=0, so left side is 0. But 2^m -2^n =0 \u2192 m=n. Then a +a\u00b2 =2^m and a +a\u00b2=2^n. So a +a\u00b2 is a power of 2. Let's check for a \u22652. For a=2: 2 +4=6, not a power of 2. a=3: 3+9=12, nope. a=1: 1+1=2=2^1. So a=1 works, but we're assuming a \u22652 here. So no solutions in this case.\n\nSo the only possible case is a < b. Let's proceed with that.\n\nSo, from the equation 2^n(2^{m-n} -1) = (a -b)(1 -a -b). Since a < b, a -b is negative, and 1 -a -b is negative (since a +b >1), so their product is positive. Let's denote this as:\n\n2^n(2^{m-n} -1) = (b -a)(a + b -1).\n\nNow, since the left side is a power of 2 multiplied by (2^{m-n} -1), which is an odd number (since 2^{m-n} is even, so 2^{m-n} -1 is odd), the right side must also be a product of a power of 2 and an odd number. But (b -a) and (a + b -1) are both positive integers. Let's see if they can be powers of 2.\n\nBut (a + b -1) and (b -a) must be such that their product is 2^n times an odd number. However, since (2^{m-n} -1) is odd, the entire left side is 2^n times an odd number. Therefore, the right side must also be 2^n times an odd number. So, one of (b -a) or (a + b -1) must be a power of 2, and the other must be an odd multiple of that power of 2. But this seems a bit vague. Maybe there's a better approach.\n\nAlternatively, since a and b are positive integers with a < b, let's consider that a + b\u00b2 and b +a\u00b2 are both powers of 2. Let's try to find bounds on a and b.\n\nSuppose a \u22652. Then b >a \u22652. Let's see:\n\nFrom a + b\u00b2 =2^m and b +a\u00b2=2^n. Let's subtract the second equation from the first: (a + b\u00b2) - (b +a\u00b2) =2^m -2^n. Rearranged: a -b +b\u00b2 -a\u00b2 =2^m -2^n. Factor: (a -b) + (b\u00b2 -a\u00b2) = (a -b) - (a\u00b2 -b\u00b2) = (a -b)(1 - (a +b)).\n\nSo, (a -b)(1 -a -b) =2^m -2^n. Since a <b, a -b is negative, and 1 -a -b is negative (since a +b \u22652 +1=3 >1), so their product is positive. So 2^m -2^n must be positive, implying m >n.\n\nSo, 2^m -2^n = (b -a)(a +b -1). Let's write this as 2^n(2^{m-n} -1) = (b -a)(a +b -1).\n\nNow, since 2^{m-n} -1 is odd, and 2^n is a power of 2, the right-hand side must be divisible by 2^n. So (b -a)(a +b -1) must be divisible by 2^n. But since (a +b -1) and (b -a) are consecutive integers? Wait, not necessarily. Let's see: Let's denote d = b -a, which is a positive integer since b >a. Then a +b -1 = a + (a +d) -1 = 2a +d -1. So d and 2a +d -1. These two numbers are not necessarily consecutive. But perhaps we can find some relation.\n\nSince d =b -a, and a \u22652, d \u22651. Let's substitute d into the equation:\n\n2^n(2^{m-n} -1) = d(2a +d -1).\n\nNow, since d and 2a +d -1 are positive integers, and their product is a multiple of 2^n, we can consider the factors. Let's note that d and 2a +d -1 must be coprime. Because if they had a common divisor greater than 1, say p, then p divides both d and 2a +d -1. Then p divides (2a +d -1) - d =2a -1. But p also divides d =b -a. So p divides 2a -1 and b -a. But since a and b are positive integers, and p divides b -a, then p divides (2a -1) + 2(b -a) =2b -1. So p divides both 2a -1 and 2b -1. But if p is a common divisor greater than 1, then p divides their difference: 2b -1 - (2a -1)=2(b -a). But p divides d =b -a, so p divides 2(b -a). But p also divides 2a -1 and 2b -1, which are both odd (since a and b are integers, 2a and 2b are even, so 2a -1 and 2b -1 are odd). Therefore, p must be odd. But p divides 2(b -a), and since p is odd, p divides (b -a). But p also divides 2a -1. So p divides (2a -1) and (b -a). Let's write b =a +d. Then p divides d and 2a -1. But since p divides d and d =b -a, which is at least 1, and p divides 2a -1. But 2a -1 and a are coprime. Because if a prime divides a and 2a -1, it would divide 1, which is impossible. So p must divide 2a -1 and d, but since a and d are coprime (as d =b -a and p divides d and 2a -1, but a and 2a -1 are coprime), this implies that p=1. Therefore, d and 2a +d -1 are coprime.\n\nTherefore, since their product is 2^n times an odd number, and they are coprime, one of them must be 2^n and the other must be the odd number (2^{m-n} -1). So either:\n\nCase 1: d =2^n and 2a +d -1 =2^{m-n} -1\n\nOr\n\nCase 2: 2a +d -1 =2^n and d =2^{m-n} -1\n\nLet's explore both cases.\n\nCase 1: d=2^n and 2a +d -1=2^{m-n} -1.\n\nSubstituting d=2^n into the second equation:\n\n2a +2^n -1 =2^{m-n} -1 \u2192 2a +2^n =2^{m-n}\n\nBut 2a +2^n =2^{m-n}. Let's factor out 2:\n\n2(a +2^{n-1}) =2^{m-n} \u2192 a +2^{n-1} =2^{m-n -1}\n\nBut a is a positive integer, so 2^{m-n -1} must be greater than 2^{n-1}. Let's see:\n\na =2^{m-n -1} -2^{n-1}\n\nSince a \u22652, we have:\n\n2^{m-n -1} -2^{n-1} \u22652 \u2192 2^{m-n -1} \u22652^{n-1} +2\n\nBut 2^{m-n -1} must be an integer. Let's set t =m -n. Then:\n\n2^{t -1} -2^{n-1} \u22652\n\nBut this seems complicated. Let's try small values of n.\n\nSuppose n=1. Then d=2^1=2. Then:\n\na +2^{0} =2^{t -1} \u2192 a +1=2^{t -1}\n\nSo a=2^{t -1} -1. Since a \u22652, 2^{t -1} -1 \u22652 \u2192 2^{t -1} \u22653 \u2192 t-1 \u22652 \u2192",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is: \"Five plus 500% of 10 is the same as 110% of what number? Show that it is 50.\" Hmm, I need to prove that when you take 5 and add 500% of 10 to it, the result is equal to 110% of some number, and that number is 50. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, let's parse the left side of the equation: \"Five plus 500% of 10.\" I know that percentages can be converted to decimals for calculations. For example, 5% is 5/100 or 0.05. So, 500% would be 500/100, which is 5. Therefore, 500% of 10 is the same as 5 times 10. Let me check that. Yes, 500% means 5 times the original value. So 5 times 10 is 50. Then, adding the initial 5 gives 5 + 50 = 55. So the left side simplifies to 55.\n\nNow, the right side says \"110% of what number.\" Let's denote that unknown number as x. So, 110% of x is the same as 55. Converting 110% to a decimal gives 1.10. Therefore, 1.10 * x = 55. To find x, I need to divide both sides by 1.10. So x = 55 / 1.10. Let me compute that. 55 divided by 1.1. Hmm, 1.1 times 50 is 55, right? Because 1.1*50 = 55. So x is 50. That matches the answer we're supposed to show.\n\nWait, let me verify each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with 500% of 10: 500% is 5, so 5*10=50. Then adding 5 gives 55. On the other side, 110% of x is 55. So 1.1x=55, so x=55/1.1=50. Yep, that checks out. Therefore, the number we're looking for is indeed 50. All the steps follow logically, converting percentages to their decimal equivalents and performing the arithmetic correctly.

We need to show that \"Five plus 500% of 10\" equals \"110% of 50.\"\n\n**Step 1: Calculate 500% of 10**  \nFirst, recall that \"percent\" means \"per hundred.\" So, 500% is equivalent to \\( \\frac{500}{100} = 5 \\).  \nThis means \"500% of 10\" is \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\).\n\n**Step 2: Add 5 to the result**  \nThe problem states \"Five plus 500% of 10,\" so we add 5 to the previous result:  \n\\( 5 + 50 = 55 \\).  \nThis simplifies the left side of the equation to **55**.\n\n**Step 3: Set up the equation for 110% of a number**  \nLet the unknown number be \\( x \\). The problem states that 55 equals \"110% of \\( x \\).\"  \nSince 110% is \\( \\frac{110}{100} = 1.1 \\), we write:  \n\\( 1.1 \\times x = 55 \\).\n\n**Step 4: Solve for \\( x \\)**  \nDivide both sides by 1.1 to isolate \\( x \\):  \n\\( x = \\frac{55}{1.1} \\).  \nSimplifying this gives \\( x = 50 \\), since \\( 1.1 \\times 50 = 55 \\).\n\n**Conclusion**  \nThus, \"Five plus 500% of 10\" equals 55, which is exactly \"110% of 50.\" This confirms the original statement is true.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  5 + 500 / 100 * 10\nx : \u211d\nh\u2080 : 5 + 500 / 100 * 10 = 110 / 100 * x\nh\u2081 : 5 + 500 / 100 * 10 = 5 + 50\n\u22a2 x = 50\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  5 + 500 / 100 * 10\nx : \u211d\nh\u2080 : 5 + 500 / 100 * 10 = 110 / 100 * x\nh\u2081 : 5 + 500 / 100 * 10 = 5 + 50\n\u22a2 x = 50\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown tactic\nfailed to synthesize\n  OfNat \u211d 50\nnumerals are polymorphic in Lean, but the numeral `50` cannot be used in a context where the expected type is\n  \u211d\ndue to the absence of the instance above\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  HMul Nat \u211d Nat\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nunsolved goals\n\u211d : Type u_1\nx : \u211d\nh\u2080 : 5 + 500 / 100 * 10 = 110 / 100 * x\n\u22a2 5 + 500 / 100 * 10 = 5 + 50\nunsolved goals\n\u211d : Type u_1\nx : \u211d\nh\u2080 : 5 + 500 / 100 * 10 = 110 / 100 * x\nh\u2081 : 5 + 500 / 100 * 10 = 5 + 50\n\u22a2 x = 50\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. We need to find the value of k + m + n where (1 - sin t)(1 - cos t) is expressed as m/n - \u221ak, with m and n being coprime positive integers. The given equation is (1 + sin t)(1 + cos t) = 5/4. \n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with products like (1 + sin t)(1 + cos t), expanding them might help. Let me try expanding both the given equation and the expression we need to find. \n\nExpanding (1 + sin t)(1 + cos t) gives 1 + sin t + cos t + sin t cos t = 5/4. Similarly, expanding (1 - sin t)(1 - cos t) would give 1 - sin t - cos t + sin t cos t. Let's call the first expansion Equation A and the second one Expression B. \n\nIf I subtract Expression B from Equation A, the sin t cos t terms would cancel out, and I'd get 2(sin t + cos t) = 5/4 - B. But maybe adding them would be better? Let me check. Adding Equation A and Expression B gives 2 + 2 sin t cos t = 5/4 + B. Hmm, not sure if that's helpful yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find sin t + cos t and sin t cos t from Equation A. Let's denote S = sin t + cos t and P = sin t cos t. Then Equation A becomes 1 + S + P = 5/4. So S + P = 1/4. \n\nBut we need another equation to solve for S and P. Let's recall that (sin t + cos t)^2 = sin\u00b2t + cos\u00b2t + 2 sin t cos t = 1 + 2P. So S\u00b2 = 1 + 2P. Since we have S + P = 1/4, maybe substitute P = 1/4 - S into S\u00b2 = 1 + 2(1/4 - S). Let's try that.\n\nSubstituting P = 1/4 - S into S\u00b2 = 1 + 2P gives S\u00b2 = 1 + 2*(1/4 - S) = 1 + 1/2 - 2S = 3/2 - 2S. Rearranging, S\u00b2 + 2S - 3/2 = 0. Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction: 2S\u00b2 + 4S - 3 = 0. Solving this quadratic equation for S using the quadratic formula: S = [-4 \u00b1 \u221a(16 + 24)] / 4 = [-4 \u00b1 \u221a40]/4 = [-4 \u00b1 2\u221a10]/4 = [-2 \u00b1 \u221a10]/2. \n\nSince sin t and cos t are both between -1 and 1, their sum S must be between -\u221a2 and \u221a2. Let's check the possible values. \u221a10 is approximately 3.16, so (-2 + \u221a10)/2 \u2248 (1.16)/2 \u2248 0.58, which is within the valid range. The other solution would be (-2 - \u221a10)/2 \u2248 negative, which might not be possible because if (1 + sin t)(1 + cos t) = 5/4, which is positive, then both 1 + sin t and 1 + cos t must be positive. Hence, sin t and cos t must be greater than -1, so their sum S is likely positive. So S = (-2 + \u221a10)/2.\n\nNow, from S + P = 1/4, we can find P = 1/4 - S = 1/4 - [(-2 + \u221a10)/2] = 1/4 + 1 - (\u221a10)/2 = 5/4 - (\u221a10)/2. Wait, let me check that calculation again. Let me compute it step by step:\n\nS = (-2 + \u221a10)/2\n\nSo P = 1/4 - S = 1/4 - (-2 + \u221a10)/2 = 1/4 + 2/2 - (\u221a10)/2 = 1/4 + 1 - (\u221a10)/2 = 5/4 - (\u221a10)/2. \n\nBut wait, 1/4 + 1 is 5/4, correct. So P = 5/4 - (\u221a10)/2. \n\nNow, Expression B is (1 - sin t)(1 - cos t) = 1 - sin t - cos t + sin t cos t = 1 - S + P. Substituting S and P:\n\n1 - S + P = 1 - [(-2 + \u221a10)/2] + [5/4 - (\u221a10)/2] \n\nLet's compute each term:\n\n1 is 1. Then subtract S: - [(-2 + \u221a10)/2] = (2 - \u221a10)/2. Then add P: + 5/4 - (\u221a10)/2.\n\nSo combining:\n\n1 + (2 - \u221a10)/2 + 5/4 - (\u221a10)/2\n\nConvert 1 to 4/4 to have common denominators:\n\n4/4 + (2 - \u221a10)/2 + 5/4 - (\u221a10)/2\n\nCombine the fractions:\n\n(4/4 + 5/4) + [(2 - \u221a10)/2 - (\u221a10)/2]\n\nThat's 9/4 + [2 - \u221a10 - \u221a10]/2 = 9/4 + (2 - 2\u221a10)/2 = 9/4 + 1 - \u221a10 = (9/4 + 4/4) - \u221a10 = 13/4 - \u221a10.\n\nSo Expression B is 13/4 - \u221a10. Therefore, m = 13, n = 4, k = 10. Then k + m + n = 10 + 13 + 4 = 27. \n\nWait, but let me verify the steps again to make sure there's no mistake. Let's go through the substitution again:\n\nExpression B = 1 - S + P\n\nWe have S = (-2 + \u221a10)/2 and P = 5/4 - (\u221a10)/2.\n\nSo:\n\n1 - [(-2 + \u221a10)/2] + [5/4 - (\u221a10)/2]\n\n= 1 + (2 - \u221a10)/2 + 5/4 - (\u221a10)/2\n\nConvert 1 to 4/4:\n\n4/4 + (2 - \u221a10)/2 + 5/4 - (\u221a10)/2\n\nCombine the constants: 4/4 + 5/4 = 9/4\n\nCombine the terms with \u221a10: [(2)/2] + [(-\u221a10)/2 - (\u221a10)/2] = 1 - \u221a10\n\nWait, no. Let's break it down:\n\nThe terms are:\n\n(2 - \u221a10)/2 = 2/2 - \u221a10/2 = 1 - (\u221a10)/2\n\nThen adding the other term: - (\u221a10)/2\n\nSo total for the \u221a10 terms: 1 - (\u221a10)/2 - (\u221a10)/2 = 1 - \u221a10\n\nThen adding the constants: 9/4 + 1 = 13/4\n\nSo total Expression B = 13/4 - \u221a10. Hence, m = 13, n =4, k=10. 13 and 4 are coprime. So 10+13+4=27. That matches the answer given.

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the problem says that when a number is divided by 5, the remainder is 3. We need to find the remainder when twice that number is divided by 5, and show that it's 1. Hmm, let's start by understanding what the given information means.\n\nFirst, if a number leaves a remainder of 3 when divided by 5, that means the number can be expressed in the form of 5k + 3, where k is some integer. Because when you divide by 5, the possible remainders are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. So the number is 5 times some integer plus 3. Let's call the number x. So x = 5k + 3.\n\nNow, we need to find twice this number, which is 2x. Let's substitute x with 5k + 3. So 2x = 2*(5k + 3) = 10k + 6. Now, we need to divide this result by 5 and find the remainder. Let's see: 10k is divisible by 5 because 10 is a multiple of 5, so 10k divided by 5 gives 2k with no remainder. Then we have 6 left. So 10k + 6 divided by 5 is 2k + 1 with a remainder of 1, because 6 divided by 5 is 1 with a remainder of 1. Wait, let me check that again. 6 divided by 5 is 1 times 5, which is 5, and the remainder is 1. So the total remainder when 2x is divided by 5 is 1. That seems straightforward.\n\nBut maybe I should approach this using modular arithmetic to confirm. If x \u2261 3 mod 5, then multiplying both sides by 2 gives 2x \u2261 2*3 mod 5, which is 6 mod 5. And 6 mod 5 is indeed 1. So 2x \u2261 1 mod 5. Therefore, the remainder is 1. That matches the earlier result. So both methods agree. \n\nWait, but let me make sure there's no mistake here. The original number x is congruent to 3 modulo 5. Multiplying both sides by 2 preserves the congruence because multiplication is compatible with modular arithmetic. So 2x \u2261 6 mod 5. Since 6 divided by 5 leaves a remainder of 1, 6 mod 5 is 1. Therefore, 2x \u2261 1 mod 5. That's correct. So the remainder is indeed 1. \n\nAlternatively, using the example from the context provided, maybe there's a similar approach. In the context, they had equations like x mod 3 = 2 and x mod 5 = 3, and they manipulated the equations using properties of modulo operations. Here, the problem is simpler because we only have one condition: x mod 5 = 3. So perhaps the same technique of expressing x as 5k + 3 and then computing 2x is the way to go. \n\nAnother way to think about it: Let's take a specific example. Suppose the number is 8. When divided by 5, 8 \u00f7 5 is 1 with a remainder of 3. Then twice 8 is 16. 16 \u00f7 5 is 3 with a remainder of 1. So the remainder is 1. Another example: take x = 13. 13 \u00f7 5 is 2 with remainder 3. Twice 13 is 26. 26 \u00f7 5 is 5 with remainder 1. Again, remainder 1. So this seems consistent. \n\nTherefore, regardless of the specific number that leaves a remainder of 3 when divided by 5, doubling it will always result in a remainder of 1 when divided by 5. This is because doubling 3 gives 6, which is 5 + 1, so the 5 part is divisible by 5, leaving 1 as the remainder. \n\nSo the key steps are: express x in terms of 5k + 3, compute 2x, simplify, and then take modulo 5. The 10k term is divisible by 5, so the remainder comes from 6 mod 5, which is 1. Hence, the remainder is 1.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nLet's start by understanding the given information. If a number leaves a remainder of 3 when divided by 5, we can express this number as \\( x = 5k + 3 \\), where \\( k \\) is an integer. This is because dividing by 5 gives a quotient \\( k \\) and a remainder of 3.\n\nNow, we want to find the remainder when twice this number (\\( 2x \\)) is divided by 5. Substitute \\( x = 5k + 3 \\) into \\( 2x \\):\n\\[\n2x = 2(5k + 3) = 10k + 6.\n\\]\n\nNext, divide \\( 10k + 6 \\) by 5. Notice that \\( 10k \\) is divisible by 5 (since \\( 10k = 5 \\cdot 2k \\)), leaving no remainder. The remaining term, 6, when divided by 5, gives:\n\\[\n6 \\div 5 = 1 \\text{ with a remainder of } 1.\n\\]\n\nThus, the remainder when \\( 2x \\) is divided by 5 is **1**. This can also be verified using modular arithmetic. Starting with \\( x \\equiv 3 \\pmod{5} \\), multiply both sides by 2:\n\\[\n2x \\equiv 2 \\cdot 3 \\pmod{5} \\implies 2x \\equiv 6 \\pmod{5}.\n\\]\nSince \\( 6 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5} \\), we conclude:\n\\[\n2x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}.\n\\]\nTherefore, the remainder is indeed **1** for any such number \\( x \\).",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to simplify this expression: (12)/(x\u00b7x) multiplied by (x\u2074)/(14x) multiplied by (35)/(3x), and show that it equals 10, given that x isn't zero. Alright, let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll write out the entire expression to visualize it better. So, it's [12/(x\u00b7x)] * [x\u2074/(14x)] * [35/(3x)]. Hmm. Let's handle each fraction separately and then combine them.\n\nStarting with the first fraction: 12 divided by x squared. That's 12/(x\u00b2). The second fraction is x\u2074 over 14x. Let me simplify that. x\u2074 divided by x is x\u00b3, so that becomes x\u00b3/14. The third fraction is 35/(3x). So putting them all together, the expression becomes (12/x\u00b2) * (x\u00b3/14) * (35/(3x)).\n\nNow, let's multiply the numerators together and the denominators together. Numerators: 12 * x\u00b3 * 35. Denominators: x\u00b2 * 14 * 3x. Let's compute the numerators first. 12 times 35 is... 12*35. Let me calculate that. 10*35 is 350, and 2*35 is 70, so 350+70=420. So the numerator is 420x\u00b3.\n\nFor the denominator: x\u00b2 times 14 times 3x. Let's multiply the constants first. 14*3 is 42. Then the x terms: x\u00b2 times x is x\u00b3. So the denominator is 42x\u00b3.\n\nSo now the expression is 420x\u00b3 divided by 42x\u00b3. Simplify that. 420 divided by 42 is 10. And x\u00b3 divided by x\u00b3 is 1 (since x isn't zero, so we're not dividing by zero). So 10*1 = 10. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 10.\n\nWait, let me check if I did that correctly. Let me go through the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with the original expression:\n\n(12/(x\u00b2)) * (x\u2074/(14x)) * (35/(3x)).\n\nMultiply numerators: 12 * x\u2074 * 35. Denominators: x\u00b2 * 14x * 3x.\n\nWait, in the denominator, 14x multiplied by 3x is 14*3*x*x = 42x\u00b2. Then multiplied by x\u00b2 from the first term: x\u00b2 * 42x\u00b2 = 42x\u2074? Wait, no. Wait, the denominators are x\u00b2, 14x, and 3x. So when multiplying denominators: x\u00b2 * 14x * 3x. Let's compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, x\u00b2 * 14x = 14x\u00b3. Then multiply by 3x: 14x\u00b3 *3x = 42x\u2074. So denominator is 42x\u2074.\n\nNumerator: 12 * x\u2074 *35. Let's compute 12*35 again. 12*30=360, 12*5=60, so 360+60=420. So numerator is 420x\u2074.\n\nSo the expression is 420x\u2074 / 42x\u2074. Which is 420/42 * x\u2074/x\u2074 = 10*1 =10. Yep, that checks out. So the simplification is indeed 10. Therefore, the answer is 10, as required.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo simplify the expression \\(\\frac{12}{x \\cdot x} \\cdot \\frac{x^4}{14x} \\cdot \\frac{35}{3x}\\) (where \\(x \\neq 0\\)), we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Combine numerators and denominators**:  \n   Multiply all numerators together and all denominators together:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{12 \\cdot x^4 \\cdot 35}{x^2 \\cdot 14x \\cdot 3x}.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Simplify constants**:  \n   - Numerator constants: \\(12 \\cdot 35 = 420\\).  \n   - Denominator constants: \\(14 \\cdot 3 = 42\\).  \n   This reduces the expression to:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{420 \\cdot x^4}{42 \\cdot x^2 \\cdot x \\cdot x}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Simplify powers of \\(x\\)**:  \n   - Denominator: \\(x^2 \\cdot x \\cdot x = x^{2+1+1} = x^4\\).  \n   The expression becomes:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{420x^4}{42x^4}.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Cancel common factors**:  \n   - Constants: \\(\\frac{420}{42} = 10\\).  \n   - Variables: \\(\\frac{x^4}{x^4} = 1\\) (since \\(x \\neq 0\\)).  \n\n   Multiplying these results gives \\(10 \\cdot 1 = 10\\).  \n\nThus, the entire expression simplifies to **10**.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The question is: If n is a multiple of three, what is the remainder when (n + 4) + (n + 6) + (n + 8) is divided by 9? We need to show that the remainder is 0.\n\nFirst, let me understand what's being asked. We have three terms: n+4, n+6, and n+8. We need to add them together and then find the remainder when divided by 9, given that n itself is a multiple of 3. The answer should be 0, so the sum must be a multiple of 9.\n\nLet me start by simplifying the expression. Let's compute the sum:\n\n(n + 4) + (n + 6) + (n + 8) = 3n + (4 + 6 + 8) = 3n + 18.\n\nSo the total sum is 3n + 18. Now, since n is a multiple of 3, let's express n as 3k where k is an integer. Substituting that in, we get:\n\n3*(3k) + 18 = 9k + 18.\n\nFactor out 9 from both terms: 9(k + 2). This clearly shows that the sum is a multiple of 9. Therefore, when divided by 9, the remainder is 0.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. But maybe I should check if there's another way to approach this, perhaps using digital roots or properties similar to the context given. The context mentioned digital roots and how the sum of three consecutive numbers ending with a multiple of 3 has a digital root of 6. However, in this problem, the numbers aren't consecutive. The terms are n+4, n+6, n+8. Let's see the difference between them. The terms are spaced by 2: between n+4 and n+6 is 2, and between n+6 and n+8 is another 2. So they are three numbers in an arithmetic sequence with common difference 2. But the original theorem was about three consecutive numbers (difference 1) where the last is a multiple of 3. Here, the setup is different.\n\nBut maybe the key is still in expressing the sum and factoring. Let's verify again. If n is a multiple of 3, say n=3k, then substituting into the sum:\n\n(3k +4) + (3k +6) + (3k +8) = 9k + 18. Which is 9(k + 2), so divisible by 9. Hence remainder 0.\n\nAlternatively, using modular arithmetic. Since n is a multiple of 3, n \u2261 0 mod 3. But we need modulo 9. Let's see. If n is a multiple of 3, n can be 0 mod 9, 3 mod 9, or 6 mod 9. Let's check each case:\n\nCase 1: n \u2261 0 mod 9. Then n = 9m. Sum becomes 9m +4 +9m +6 +9m +8 = 27m + 18 \u2261 0 + 18 \u2261 18 \u2261 0 mod 9 (since 18 is divisible by 9).\n\nWait, 18 mod 9 is 0. So yes.\n\nCase 2: n \u2261 3 mod 9. Then n = 9m +3. Sum: (9m+3+4)+(9m+3+6)+(9m+3+8) = (9m+7)+(9m+9)+(9m+11) = 27m + 27. Which is 27(m +1), so divisible by 9. Hence remainder 0.\n\nCase 3: n \u22616 mod 9. Then n=9m+6. Sum: (9m+6+4)+(9m+6+6)+(9m+6+8)= (9m+10)+(9m+12)+(9m+14)=27m +36=9(3m +4), which is divisible by 9. So remainder 0.\n\nTherefore, in all cases, the sum is divisible by 9. Hence remainder 0.\n\nAlternatively, using the digital root concept. The digital root of a number is congruent to the number modulo 9. If the sum is divisible by 9, its digital root is 9, but if the remainder is 0, then digital root is 9. Wait, but the problem says to show the remainder is 0, which would mean the digital root is 9. However, in the context theorem, the digital root was 6. But here, the sum is 3n +18. If n is a multiple of 3, then 3n is a multiple of 9, so 3n +18 is 9k +18 =9(k+2), which is a multiple of 9. Therefore, digital root would be 9, which corresponds to remainder 0 when divided by 9. So the digital root here is 9, but since digital root is the same as the number modulo 9, except when the number is 0 modulo 9, the digital root is 9. So the remainder is 0.\n\nTherefore, the proof holds. The key steps are substituting n as a multiple of 3, simplifying the sum, and showing it's a multiple of 9. Alternatively, using modular arithmetic for each possible residue of n modulo 9 (since n is a multiple of 3, possible residues mod 9 are 0,3,6) and showing in each case the sum is 0 mod 9.\n\nAnother angle: The original context had three consecutive numbers summing to 9r -3, which was rewritten as 9(r-1) +6, leading to a digital root of 6. Here, the sum is 9(k+2), so digital root 9, hence remainder 0. So the structure is similar but different because the sum here is a multiple of 9, hence remainder 0.\n\nSo the main idea is that when n is a multiple of 3, the sum (n+4)+(n+6)+(n+8) simplifies to 3n +18, which is 3*(n) +18. Since n is a multiple of 3, 3n is a multiple of 9, and 18 is also a multiple of 9. Therefore, the entire sum is a multiple of 9, so the remainder when divided by 9 is 0.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nLet's start by simplifying the expression \\((n + 4) + (n + 6) + (n + 8)\\). Combining like terms, we get:\n\\[\n3n + (4 + 6 + 8) = 3n + 18.\n\\]\nSince \\(n\\) is a multiple of \\(3\\), we can write \\(n = 3k\\) for some integer \\(k\\). Substituting this into the expression:\n\\[\n3(3k) + 18 = 9k + 18.\n\\]\nFactoring out \\(9\\), we have:\n\\[\n9(k + 2).\n\\]\nThis shows the sum is a multiple of \\(9\\). When any multiple of \\(9\\) is divided by \\(9\\), the remainder is \\(0\\).\n\nTo confirm, consider modular arithmetic. If \\(n\\) is a multiple of \\(3\\), \\(n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}\\). However, since we need modulo \\(9\\), note that \\(n\\) could be \\(0\\), \\(3\\), or \\(6 \\pmod{9}\\) (the only residues for multiples of \\(3\\) modulo \\(9\\)). Testing all cases:\n- If \\(n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{9}\\), the sum becomes \\(0 + 18 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{9}\\).\n- If \\(n \\equiv 3 \\pmod{9}\\), the sum becomes \\(9 + 18 \\equiv 27 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{9}\\).\n- If \\(n \\equiv 6 \\pmod{9}\\), the sum becomes \\(18 + 18 \\equiv 36 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{9}\\).\n\nIn every case, the remainder is \\(0\\). Thus, the sum \\((n + 4) + (n + 6) + (n + 8)\\) is always divisible by \\(9\\) when \\(n\\) is a multiple of \\(3\\), leaving a remainder of \\(0\\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: simp made no progress\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unsolved goals\nn : \u2115\nh\u2080 : 0 < n\nh\u2081 : 3 \u2223 n\nh\u2082 : n % 3 = 0\n\u22a2 (n + (4 + (n + (6 + (n + 8))))) % 9 = 0\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unexpected token '#'; expected command\nunknown tactic\nfailed to synthesize\n  LT \u2115\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  Dvd \u2115\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  OfNat \u2115 0\nnumerals are polymorphic in Lean, but the numeral `0` cannot be used in a context where the expected type is\n  \u2115\ndue to the absence of the instance above\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  OfNat \u2115 0\nnumerals are polymorphic in Lean, but the numeral `0` cannot be used in a context where the expected type is\n  \u2115\ndue to the absence of the instance above\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  OfNat \u2115 3\nnumerals are polymorphic in Lean, but the numeral `3` cannot be used in a context where the expected type is\n  \u2115\ndue to the absence of the instance above\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  HAdd \u2115 Nat ?m.197\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  HAdd \u2115 Nat ?m.198\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  HAdd \u2115 Nat ?m.223\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is to find the value of abc given three equations: 3a + b + c = -3, a + 3b + c = 9, and a + b + 3c = 19. And we need to show that abc is -56. Hmm. \n\nFirst, I need to solve for a, b, and c. But solving three equations with three variables might be a bit tedious. Let me think if there's a smarter way. Maybe adding the equations together? Let's try that.\n\nIf I add all three equations:\n\n(3a + b + c) + (a + 3b + c) + (a + b + 3c) = -3 + 9 + 19.\n\nCalculating the left side: 3a + a + a = 5a; similarly for b: b + 3b + b = 5b; and c: c + c + 3c = 5c. So total left side is 5a + 5b + 5c. The right side is 25. So 5(a + b + c) = 25, which means a + b + c = 5. \n\nNow, we have a + b + c = 5. Let's see how this can help. Let's look at the original equations again. For example, the first equation is 3a + b + c = -3. But since a + b + c = 5, maybe subtract these equations to eliminate variables.\n\nTake the first equation: 3a + b + c = -3. Subtract (a + b + c) = 5 from this. So 3a + b + c - (a + b + c) = -3 -5 \u2192 2a = -8 \u2192 a = -4. \n\nSimilarly, take the second equation: a + 3b + c =9. Subtract (a + b + c) =5: (a +3b +c) - (a +b +c) =9 -5 \u2192 2b =4 \u2192 b=2.\n\nThird equation: a + b +3c =19. Subtract (a +b +c)=5: (a +b +3c) - (a +b +c) =19 -5 \u2192 2c=14 \u2192 c=7.\n\nSo now we have a=-4, b=2, c=7. Then abc = (-4)*2*7 = -56. That's the answer. But wait, the problem says to \"show that it is -56,\" so maybe there's another way using the context provided, like the summation of powers over product of differences? But the straightforward method seems to work here. Let me check if that's valid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the theorem from the context. The theorem mentioned in the context is about sums of powers over products of differences. The example given has expressions like 1/[(a-b)(a-c)] + similar terms equals 0, 0, 1, and a+b+c depending on the power. But how does that relate to solving linear equations?\n\nHmm. The problem given is a system of linear equations. The context's theorem seems to be about a specific summation formula for different exponents. Maybe the problem is designed to lead to abc=-56 through solving the system directly, which is straightforward. The context might be a red herring here, or perhaps there's a more complex method, but given that the equations are linear and the variables can be solved step by step, the direct approach is probably the intended path.\n\nLet me verify the solution again. If a=-4, b=2, c=7:\n\nFirst equation: 3*(-4) +2 +7 = -12 +9 = -3 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSecond equation: -4 +3*2 +7 = -4 +6 +7 =9 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThird equation: -4 +2 +3*7 = -4 +2 +21=19 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo all equations are satisfied. Therefore, abc = (-4)(2)(7) = -56. \n\nTherefore, the answer is indeed -56. The context's theorem might not be necessary here because the problem can be solved directly by solving the system of equations. Maybe the context is provided in case someone wants to use a different method, but in this case, the straightforward substitution works perfectly.\n</think>\n\n# Informal Proof:\nTo find the value of \\( abc \\) given the system of equations:\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\n3a + b + c = -3, \\\\\na + 3b + c = 9, \\\\\na + b + 3c = 19,\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nwe start by observing that adding all three equations simplifies the system. Adding them gives:\n\\[\n(3a + b + c) + (a + 3b + c) + (a + b + 3c) = -3 + 9 + 19.\n\\]\nSimplifying the left-hand side:\n\\[\n5a + 5b + 5c = 25 \\implies a + b + c = 5.\n\\]\nNow, subtract \\( a + b + c = 5 \\) from each original equation to isolate variables:\n1. From the first equation:  \n   \\( 3a + b + c - (a + b + c) = -3 - 5 \\implies 2a = -8 \\implies a = -4 \\).\n2. From the second equation:  \n   \\( a + 3b + c - (a + b + c) = 9 - 5 \\implies 2b = 4 \\implies b = 2 \\).\n3. From the third equation:  \n   \\( a + b + 3c - (a + b + c) = 19 - 5 \\implies 2c = 14 \\implies c = 7 \\).\n\nSubstituting \\( a = -4 \\), \\( b = 2 \\), and \\( c = 7 \\) into \\( abc \\):\n\\[\nabc = (-4)(2)(7) = -56.\n\\]\nVerification confirms these values satisfy all three original equations.
