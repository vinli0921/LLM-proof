This is a strong condition, as it implies that \\( f \\) is not only differentiable but also infinitely differentiable and analytic, meaning it can be represented by a power series around any point in \\(\\Omega\\).\n\nNow, let's consider the condition that the imaginary part of \\( f \\), denoted as \\(\\text{Im}(f)\\), is constant. This means that for every point \\( z \\) in \\(\\Omega\\), the imaginary part of \\( f(z) \\) is the same fixed value. We can express \\( f \\) as \\( f(z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y) \\), where \\( u(x, y) \\) and \\( v(x, y) \\) are real-valued functions representing the real and imaginary parts of \\( f \\), respectively. The condition that \\(\\text{Im}(f)\\) is constant translates to \\( v(x, y) = c \\) for some constant \\( c \\).\n\nSince \\( f \\) is holomorphic, it satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations, which are:\n\\[ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} \\]\n\\[ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = -\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} \\]\n\nGiven that \\( v(x, y) = c \\), the partial derivatives of \\( v \\) with respect to both \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are zero:\n\\[ \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} = 0 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} = 0 \\]\n\nSubstituting these into the Cauchy-Riemann equations, we get:\n\\[ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = 0 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = 0 \\]\n\nThese equations imply that the partial derivatives of \\( u \\) with respect to both \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are zero, which means that \\( u \\) is also constant. Therefore, \\( f(z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y) = a + ic \\), where \\( a \\) is a constant.\n\nThus, \\( f \\) is constant throughout the open set \\(\\Omega\\). This completes the proof that if the imaginary part of a holomorphic function is constant, then the function itself must be constant.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ':='; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ':='; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unexpected token '\u2202'; expected term\nunsolved goals\ncase h_cr\nf : \u2102 \u2192 \u2102\n\u03a9 : Set \u2102\na b : \u2191\u03a9\nh : IsOpen \u03a9\nhf : DifferentiableOn \u2102 f \u03a9\nc : \u211d\nhc h_const h_const_im : \u2200 z \u2208 \u03a9, (f z).im = c\nz : \u2102\nhz : z \u2208 \u03a9\nh_diff : DifferentiableAt \u2102 f z\n\u22a2 sorryAx (Sort ?u.1264) true\n\nf : \u2102 \u2192 \u2102\n\u03a9 : Set \u2102\na b : \u2191\u03a9\nh : IsOpen \u03a9\nhf : DifferentiableOn \u2102 f \u03a9\nc : \u211d\nhc h_const h_const_im : \u2200 z \u2208 \u03a9, (f z).im = c\nz : \u2102\nhz : z \u2208 \u03a9\nh_diff : DifferentiableAt \u2102 f z\nh_cr : sorryAx (Sort ?u.1264) true\n\u22a2 (f z).re = (f \u2191a).re\nunsolved goals\ncase intro\nf : \u2102 \u2192 \u2102\n\u03a9 : Set \u2102\na b : \u2191\u03a9\nh : IsOpen \u03a9\nhf : DifferentiableOn \u2102 f \u03a9\nc : \u211d\nhc h_const h_const_im : \u2200 z \u2208 \u03a9, (f z).im = c\nh_const_re : \u2200 z \u2208 \u03a9, (f z).re = (f \u2191a).re\n\u22a2 f \u2191a = f \u2191b\nPlease revise the proof.",

The series is given by:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} n z^n = z + 2z^2 + 3z^3 + 4z^4 + \\cdots \\]\n\nWe are interested in the behavior of this series when \\(z\\) is on the unit circle, which means \\(|z| = 1\\).\n\nFor a power series to converge at a point \\(z\\), the terms of the series must get smaller and approach zero as \\(n\\) becomes very large. However, let's examine the terms of our series:\n\n- The \\(n\\)-th term of the series is \\(n z^n\\).\n- On the unit circle, \\(|z| = 1\\), so \\(|z^n| = 1\\) for any integer \\(n\\).\n- Therefore, the magnitude of each term is \\(|n z^n| = n \\cdot |z^n| = n\\).\n\nNotice that as \\(n\\) increases, the magnitude of each term \\(n\\) also increases without bound. This means that the terms of the series do not approach zero; in fact, they grow larger and larger.\n\nTo see why this prevents convergence, recall that for a series to converge, the terms must not only approach zero, but they must do so quickly enough that their sum remains finite. Here, since the terms \\(n z^n\\) grow indefinitely, the partial sums of the series:\n\n\\[ S_N = z + 2z^2 + 3z^3 + \\cdots + Nz^N \\]\n\nalso grow indefinitely as \\(N\\) increases. The partial sums do not settle down to a finite limit, which is a requirement for convergence.\n\nThus, because the terms \\(n z^n\\) do not approach zero and the partial sums \\(S_N\\) grow without bound, the series \\(\\sum nz^n\\) cannot converge at any point on the unit circle where \\(|z| = 1\\).\n\nIn conclusion, the power series \\(\\sum nz^n\\) does not converge on any point of the unit circle because the terms of the series grow indefinitely, preventing the series from having a finite sum.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  IsAbsoluteValue fun i => ?m.60276 i * z

This is a series where each term is of the form \\(\\frac{z^n}{n}\\), with \\(z\\) being a complex number. We are interested in the behavior of this series when \\(z\\) lies on the unit circle, which means \\(|z| = 1\\).\n\nThe unit circle in the complex plane is the set of all complex numbers \\(z\\) such that \\(|z| = 1\\). This includes numbers like \\(z = e^{i\\theta}\\) for \\(\\theta\\) ranging from \\(0\\) to \\(2\\pi\\).\n\nNow, let's consider the convergence of the series at different points on the unit circle:\n\n1. **At \\(z = 1\\):** The series becomes \\(\\sum \\frac{1^n}{n} = \\sum \\frac{1}{n}\\), which is the harmonic series. It is well-known that the harmonic series diverges. Therefore, the series does not converge at \\(z = 1\\).\n\n2. **At other points on the unit circle (\\(|z| = 1\\) and \\(z \\neq 1\\)):** For these points, we can use a result from complex analysis known as Abel's test or Dirichlet's test for convergence. These tests help us determine the convergence of series where the terms are not necessarily positive.\n\n   When \\(z \\neq 1\\), the sequence \\((z^n)\\) behaves like a sequence of complex numbers on the unit circle. Importantly, the sequence \\((z^n)\\) is bounded (since \\(|z^n| = 1\\) for all \\(n\\)) and does not converge to any particular value because \\(z^n\\) keeps rotating around the unit circle.\n\n   The key insight is that the terms \\(\\frac{z^n}{n}\\) become smaller as \\(n\\) increases because of the \\(\\frac{1}{n}\\) factor. The sequence \\((\\frac{1}{n})\\) is a decreasing sequence that approaches zero. This decreasing nature, combined with the boundedness of \\((z^n)\\), allows us to apply Dirichlet's test, which states that if one sequence is decreasing to zero and the other is bounded, the series converges.\n\nTherefore, for any \\(z\\) on the unit circle except \\(z = 1\\), the series \\(\\sum \\frac{z^n}{n}\\) converges.\n\nIn summary, the series \\(\\sum \\frac{z^n}{n}\\) converges at every point on the unit circle except at \\(z = 1\\) due to the divergence of the harmonic series at that point. At all other points, the combination of the decreasing nature of \\(\\frac{1}{n}\\) and the boundedness of \\(z^n\\) ensures convergence.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

As \\(x\\) approaches 0, the function \\(\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\) approaches 1. This is because \\(\\sin x \\approx x\\) when \\(x\\) is very small, so \\(\\frac{\\sin x}{x} \\approx \\frac{x}{x} = 1\\). Therefore, the function is well-behaved at \\(x = 0\\).\n\nNext, consider the behavior as \\(x\\) becomes large. As \\(x\\) increases, \\(\\sin x\\) oscillates between -1 and 1, but \\(\\frac{1}{x}\\) decreases towards 0. This means that \\(\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\) oscillates between \\(-\\frac{1}{x}\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{x}\\), both of which approach 0 as \\(x\\) goes to infinity. Thus, the function \\(\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\) diminishes in magnitude as \\(x\\) increases.\n\nTo evaluate the integral, we can use a technique involving the Fourier transform. The function \\(\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\) is known as the sinc function, and it has a well-known Fourier transform. The Fourier transform of the sinc function is a rectangular function, which is 1 for frequencies between \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), and 0 otherwise. This property is crucial because it allows us to relate the integral of the sinc function over all positive \\(x\\) to the area under this rectangular function.\n\nThe integral of the sinc function from 0 to infinity can be thought of as half of the integral from \\(-\\infty\\) to \\(\\infty\\), due to the symmetry of the sinc function. The integral from \\(-\\infty\\) to \\(\\infty\\) of the sinc function is known to be \\(\\pi\\), which is the area of the rectangular function in the frequency domain. Therefore, the integral from 0 to \\(\\infty\\) is half of this, which is \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\).\n\nThus, by understanding the behavior of the sinc function and using properties of the Fourier transform, we conclude that:\n\n\\[\n\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\sin x}{x} \\, dx = \\frac{\\pi}{2}.\n\\]\nPrevious attempt failed with: unexpected end of input\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

This means we can write:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty c_n(z - z_0)^n, \\]\n\nwhere the coefficients \\( c_n \\) are determined by the derivatives of \\( f \\) at \\( z_0 \\).\n\nThe condition given in the problem states that for each \\( z_0 \\), there is at least one \\( c_n = 0 \\). This means that for every point \\( z_0 \\), the power series expansion of \\( f \\) has a \"gap\" \u2014 at least one term in the series is missing.\n\nNow, consider what this implies for the function \\( f \\). If \\( f \\) were not a polynomial, it would have an infinite number of non-zero terms in its power series expansion around some point. However, the condition that at least one coefficient is zero for every \\( z_0 \\) suggests that \\( f \\) cannot have an infinite number of non-zero terms globally. \n\nTo see why, imagine trying to construct a non-polynomial analytic function that satisfies the condition. If \\( f \\) had infinitely many non-zero terms, then for some \\( z_0 \\), the power series would have to include all these terms, contradicting the requirement that at least one coefficient is zero. \n\nTherefore, the only way for \\( f \\) to satisfy the condition at every point \\( z_0 \\) is if \\( f \\) has only finitely many non-zero terms in its power series expansion around any point. This means \\( f \\) must be a polynomial, as a polynomial is precisely a function that can be expressed as a power series with only finitely many non-zero terms.\n\nIn conclusion, the condition that at least one coefficient is zero in the power series expansion around every point \\( z_0 \\) forces \\( f \\) to be a polynomial, as only polynomials can have such a property globally across the complex plane.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unexpected token ','; expected '\u21a6', '=>'\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ':='; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

The idea is to extend the real integral into the complex plane and evaluate it using the residue theorem, which is a powerful tool for evaluating integrals of certain types of functions.\n\nFirst, consider the function \\( f(z) = \\frac{z e^{iz}}{z^2 + a^2} \\), where \\( z \\) is a complex number. Notice that on the real line, the imaginary part of \\( e^{iz} \\) is \\( \\sin x \\), so the real integral we want to evaluate is related to the imaginary part of the integral of \\( f(z) \\) over the real line.\n\nTo apply the residue theorem, we need to consider a closed contour in the complex plane. A common choice is a semicircular contour in the upper half-plane, consisting of the real line segment from \\(-R\\) to \\(R\\) and a semicircular arc of radius \\(R\\) in the upper half-plane. As \\( R \\to \\infty \\), the contribution from the semicircular arc will vanish under certain conditions, allowing us to focus on the real line segment.\n\nThe function \\( f(z) \\) has poles at \\( z = ai \\) and \\( z = -ai \\). Since we are considering a contour in the upper half-plane, only the pole at \\( z = ai \\) is relevant. The residue of \\( f(z) \\) at \\( z = ai \\) can be calculated using the formula for the residue of a simple pole:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Residue of } f(z) \\text{ at } z = ai = \\lim_{z \\to ai} (z - ai) f(z) = \\lim_{z \\to ai} \\frac{z e^{iz}}{z + ai}.\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( z = ai \\), we get:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Residue} = \\frac{ai e^{-a}}{2ai} = \\frac{e^{-a}}{2}.\n\\]\n\nBy the residue theorem, the integral of \\( f(z) \\) over the closed contour is \\( 2\\pi i \\) times the sum of the residues inside the contour. Since there is only one pole inside the contour, the integral over the closed contour is:\n\n\\[\n2\\pi i \\cdot \\frac{e^{-a}}{2} = \\pi i e^{-a}.\n\\]\n\nThe integral over the semicircular arc vanishes as \\( R \\to \\infty \\), so the integral over the real line is equal to the imaginary part of the integral over the closed contour. Therefore, the original integral is:\n\n\\[\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{x \\sin x}{x^2 + a^2} \\, dx = \\text{Im}(\\pi i e^{-a}) = \\pi e^{-a}.\n\\]\n\nThus, we have shown that the integral evaluates to \\( \\pi e^{-a} \\) for \\( a > 0 \\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: \nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: \nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "# Informal Proof:\nTo prove that all entire functions that are also injective must be of the form \\( f(z) = az + b \\) where \\( a, b \\in \\mathbb{C} \\) and \\( a \\neq 0 \\), we need to consider the properties of entire functions and injectivity.\n\nAn entire function is a function that is holomorphic (complex differentiable) everywhere on the complex plane. A classic result in complex analysis is Liouville's Theorem, which states that any bounded entire function must be constant. This theorem is crucial in understanding the behavior of entire functions.\n\nNow, let's consider an entire function \\( f \\) that is also injective. Injectivity means that if \\( f(z_1) = f(z_2) \\), then \\( z_1 = z_2 \\). In other words, the function never takes the same value at two different points.\n\nSuppose \\( f \\) is not of the form \\( az + b \\). Then, it must be a non-linear entire function, which means it has a degree of at least 2. A non-linear entire function, such as a polynomial of degree 2 or higher, will have critical points where the derivative is zero. At these critical points, the function cannot be injective because, locally, it behaves like a polynomial of degree 2 or higher, which means it will map multiple points to the same value (consider, for example, the function \\( z^2 \\) which maps both \\( z \\) and \\(-z\\) to the same value).\n\nTherefore, if \\( f \\) is injective, it cannot have any critical points where the derivative is zero. This implies that the derivative of \\( f \\), \\( f'(z) \\), must be non-zero everywhere on the complex plane. The only entire functions with a non-zero derivative everywhere are linear functions of the form \\( f(z) = az + b \\), where \\( a \\neq 0 \\).\n\nThus, if \\( f \\) is an entire and injective function, it must be of the form \\( f(z) = az + b \\) with \\( a \\neq 0 \\). This ensures that the function is both entire (since polynomials are entire) and injective (since linear functions are injective as long as \\( a \\neq 0 \\)).\n\nIn conclusion, the only entire functions that are injective are linear functions of the form \\( f(z) = az + b \\), where \\( a \\neq 0 \\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: type mismatch\n  h7\nhas type\n  z1 \u2260 z2 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  b \u2260 b : Prop\napplication type mismatch\n  hf_inj h6\nargument\n  h6\nhas type\n  \u2200 (z1 z2 : \u2102), z1 \u2260 z2 \u2192 f z1 \u2260 f z2 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  f ?m.929 = f ?m.930 : Prop\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  f 1\ncase a\nf : \u2102 \u2192 \u2102\nhf : Differentiable \u2102 f\nhf_inj : Injective f\na b : \u2102\nhf_eq : f = fun z => a * z + b\nh_a_eq_0 : a = 0\nh_f_const : \u2200 (z : \u2102), f z = b\nh_inj : Injective f\n\u22a2 f b = b\nunsolved goals\ncase h.right\nf : \u2102 \u2192 \u2102\nhf : Differentiable \u2102 f\nhf_inj : Injective f\na b : \u2102\nhf_eq : f = fun z => a * z + b\nh_a_eq_0 : a = 0\nh_f_const : \u2200 (z : \u2102), f z = b\nh_inj : Injective f\nh_b_eq_0 : b = 0\n\u22a2 False\ntype mismatch\n  h_f_not_const\nhas type\n  \u2203 z1 z2, z1 \u2260 z2 \u2227 f z1 \u2260 f z2 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  False : Prop\nno goals to be solved\nPlease revise the proof.",

If \\(f\\) is also bounded, it means there exists some constant \\(M\\) such that \\(|f(z)| \\leq M\\) for all \\(z\\) in the unit disc.\n\nNow, since \\(f\\) is not identically zero, it has a set of zeros \\(\\{z_1, z_2, \\ldots\\}\\) within the unit disc. The condition \\(|z_k| < 1\\) ensures that each zero is strictly inside the unit disc.\n\nThe key tool to use here is the Blaschke condition, which provides a criterion for the convergence of a series related to the zeros of a bounded holomorphic function. Specifically, the Blaschke condition states that for a sequence of points \\(\\{z_n\\}\\) in the unit disc, the series \\(\\sum_n (1 - |z_n|)\\) converges if and only if there exists a bounded holomorphic function in the unit disc with these points as its zeros.\n\nSince \\(f\\) is bounded and holomorphic in the unit disc, and it has zeros \\(\\{z_1, z_2, \\ldots\\}\\), the Blaschke condition tells us that the series \\(\\sum_n (1 - |z_n|)\\) must converge. This is because the existence of such a bounded holomorphic function (our function \\(f\\)) with these zeros directly implies the convergence of the series.\n\nIn summary, the boundedness of \\(f\\) and the fact that it is holomorphic in the unit disc ensure that the zeros \\(\\{z_n\\}\\) satisfy the Blaschke condition. Therefore, the series \\(\\sum_n (1 - |z_n|)\\) is finite, as required. This result is a beautiful interplay between the properties of holomorphic functions and the geometry of their zeros within the unit disc.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

An irrational number \\( x \\) cannot be expressed as a fraction of two integers; its decimal representation is non-repeating and non-terminating.\n\nNow, let's assume for the sake of contradiction that \\( rx \\) is rational.

In this space, any vector $\\mathbf{x}$ can be represented as a single real number, say $x$. Similarly, any vector $\\mathbf{y}$ can also be represented as a single real number, say $y$.\n\nThe problem asks us to show that there is no non-zero vector $\\mathbf{y}$ such that the dot product of $\\mathbf{x}$ and $\\mathbf{y}$ is zero. In one-dimensional space, the dot product of two vectors $\\mathbf{x}$ and $\\mathbf{y}$ is simply the product of the two numbers representing these vectors. So, the dot product $\\mathbf{x} \\cdot \\mathbf{y}$ is just $x \\cdot y$.\n\nNow, let's consider what it means for $x \\cdot y = 0$. For the product of two numbers to be zero, at least one of the numbers must be zero. This is a fundamental property of real numbers. Therefore, if $x \\cdot y = 0$, then either $x = 0$ or $y = 0$ (or both).\n\nThe problem specifies that $\\mathbf{y} \\neq 0$, which means $y \\neq 0$. Given this, the only way for $x \\cdot y = 0$ to hold true is if $x = 0$. \n\nHowever, the problem does not specify any condition on $\\mathbf{x}$, so we must consider the general case. If $\\mathbf{x}$ is any vector in $R^1$, and we want $x \\cdot y = 0$ with $y \\neq 0$, the only solution is $x = 0$. But if $x = 0$, then $\\mathbf{x}$ is the zero vector, which contradicts the existence of a non-zero vector $\\mathbf{y}$ such that their dot product is zero.\n\nThus, in one-dimensional space, if $\\mathbf{y} \\neq 0$, there cannot exist a vector $\\mathbf{x}$ such that $\\mathbf{x} \\cdot \\mathbf{y} = 0$, unless $\\mathbf{x}$ itself is the zero vector. Since the problem does not allow for $\\mathbf{x}$ to be zero, we conclude that no such non-zero $\\mathbf{y}$ can exist.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that in $R^1$, there does not exist a non-zero vector $\\mathbf{y}$ such that $\\mathbf{x} \\cdot \\mathbf{y} = 0$ for any non-zero vector $\\mathbf{x}$.\nPrevious attempt failed with: simp made no progress\nPlease revise the proof.",

Two sets are considered separated if the closure of one set does not intersect the other set, and vice versa. In simpler terms, there should be no point in one set that is arbitrarily close to the other set.\n\nNow, let's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Disjoint Sets**: By definition, \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) being disjoint means that they have no elements in common. That is, there is no point \\(x\\) such that \\(x\\) is in both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\).\n\n2. **Closed Sets**: A set is closed if it contains all its limit points.

This means that the closure of \\(A\\) is just \\(A\\) itself, and the closure of \\(B\\) is \\(B\\) itself.\n\n- **No Intersection of Closures**: Because \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are disjoint, there are no points that are in both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\).

A space is compact if every open cover of the space has a finite subcover. An open cover is a collection of open sets whose union includes the entire space, and a subcover is a subset of this collection that still covers the space.\n\nA base for a topology on a space is a collection of open sets such that any open set in the space can be written as a union of sets from this collection. If this collection is countable, we say the space has a countable base.\n\nNow, let's see why every compact metric space has a countable base. The key tool here is the concept of a dense subset. A subset \\( D \\) of a metric space is dense if every point in the space is either in \\( D \\) or is a limit point of \\( D \\). In metric spaces, we can always find a countable dense subset. This is because metric spaces are separable, meaning they have a countable dense subset.\n\nLet's construct a countable base using this dense subset. Suppose \\( D = \\{d_1, d_2, d_3, \\ldots\\} \\) is a countable dense subset of our compact metric space \\( K \\). For each point \\( d_i \\) in \\( D \\) and each positive integer \\( n \\), consider the open ball \\( B(d_i, 1/n) \\), which is the set of all points in \\( K \\) within distance \\( 1/n \\) of \\( d_i \\).\n\nThe collection of all such open balls \\( \\{B(d_i, 1/n) \\mid i \\in \\mathbb{N}, n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\} \\) is countable because it is a countable union of countable sets (since both \\( i \\) and \\( n \\) range over the natural numbers, which are countable).\n\nNow, we claim that this collection forms a base for the topology on \\( K \\). To see why, take any open set \\( U \\) in \\( K \\). For each point \\( x \\) in \\( U \\), there is some open ball \\( B(x, \\epsilon) \\) contained in \\( U \\) because open sets in metric spaces are unions of open balls. Since \\( D \\) is dense, there is a point \\( d_i \\) in \\( D \\) that is very close to \\( x \\), specifically within \\( \\epsilon/2 \\) of \\( x \\). Therefore, the ball \\( B(d_i, \\epsilon/2) \\) will be contained in \\( B(x, \\epsilon) \\) and hence in \\( U \\).\n\nBy doing this for every point in \\( U \\), we can express \\( U \\) as a union of these smaller balls \\( B(d_i, \\epsilon/2) \\), each of which is in our countable collection. Thus, every open set in \\( K \\) can be written as a union of sets from our countable collection, proving that this collection is indeed a base for the topology on \\( K \\).\n\nTherefore, every compact metric space has a countable base, as we have constructed one using a countable dense subset and open balls.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unexpected token ','; expected '}'\nunsolved goals\nK : Type u_1\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : MetricSpace K\ninst\u271d : CompactSpace K\n\u22a2 \u2203 B, B.Countable \u2227 IsTopologicalBasis B\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unexpected token ','; expected '}'\nunsolved goals\nK : Type u_1\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : MetricSpace K\ninst\u271d : CompactSpace K\nD : \u2115 \u2192 K := sorryAx (\u2115 \u2192 K) true\n\u22a2 \u2203 B, B.Countable \u2227 IsTopologicalBasis B\nPlease revise the proof.",

An open set is a set where, for every point in the set, there exists some small interval around that point which is entirely contained within the set. For example, the open interval \\((a, b)\\) is an open set, as is the union of several such intervals.\n\nNow, consider any open set \\(U\\) in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\).

The collection of all such intervals forms a cover for \\(U\\).\n\n2. **Form Maximal Intervals**: For each point \\(x\\) in \\(U\\), consider the largest open interval \\((c, d)\\) that contains \\(x\\) and is entirely within \\(U\\). This interval is maximal in the sense that you cannot extend it further without leaving \\(U\\). \n\n3. **Disjoint Intervals**: These maximal intervals are disjoint.

Therefore, each point in \\(U\\) belongs to exactly one of these disjoint intervals.\n\n4. **Countability**: The set of all such disjoint maximal intervals is at most countable. This is because each interval contains a rational number (since rational numbers are dense in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\)), and there are only countably many rational numbers. Thus, we can associate each interval with a unique rational number it contains, ensuring that the collection of intervals is at most countable.\n\nBy following these steps, we have shown that any open set \\(U\\) in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) can be decomposed into a union of disjoint open intervals, and the number of such intervals is at most countable.

The lim sup of a sequence is essentially the largest value that the sequence approaches infinitely often. It can be thought of as the \"eventual upper bound\" of the sequence.\n\nLet's consider two sequences of real numbers, \\(\\{a_n\\}\\) and \\(\\{b_n\\}\\). We want to show that the lim sup of their sum, \\(\\{a_n + b_n\\}\\), is less than or equal to the sum of their individual lim sups, \\(\\limsup_{n \\to \\infty} a_n + \\limsup_{n \\to \\infty} b_n\\).\n\nFirst, let's denote:\n- \\(L_a = \\limsup_{n \\to \\infty} a_n\\)\n- \\(L_b = \\limsup_{n \\to \\infty} b_n\\)\n\nBy definition, for any small positive number \\(\\epsilon\\), there are infinitely many indices \\(n\\) such that \\(a_n > L_a - \\epsilon\\) and \\(b_n > L_b - \\epsilon\\). This means that the values of \\(a_n\\) and \\(b_n\\) can get arbitrarily close to \\(L_a\\) and \\(L_b\\), respectively, from below.\n\nNow, consider the sequence \\(\\{a_n + b_n\\}\\). For any \\(\\epsilon > 0\\), there are infinitely many indices \\(n\\) such that:\n\\[ a_n + b_n > (L_a - \\epsilon) + (L_b - \\epsilon) = L_a + L_b - 2\\epsilon. \\]\n\nThis implies that the sequence \\(\\{a_n + b_n\\}\\) can get arbitrarily close to \\(L_a + L_b\\) from below, minus a small adjustment of \\(2\\epsilon\\).\n\nHowever, the lim sup of \\(\\{a_n + b_n\\}\\) is the smallest value that the sequence approaches infinitely often from above. Therefore, the lim sup of \\(\\{a_n + b_n\\}\\) cannot exceed \\(L_a + L_b\\) because, for any \\(\\epsilon > 0\\), there are infinitely many terms of the sequence that are less than \\(L_a + L_b - 2\\epsilon\\).\n\nThus, we conclude that:\n\\[\n\\limsup_{n \\to \\infty} (a_n + b_n) \\leq L_a + L_b = \\limsup_{n \\to \\infty} a_n + \\limsup_{n \\to \\infty} b_n.\n\\]\n\nThis inequality holds as long as the sum \\(L_a + L_b\\) is not of the indeterminate form \\(\\infty - \\infty\\), which would make the sum undefined. In all other cases, the inequality is valid, demonstrating that the lim sup of the sum of two sequences is bounded by the sum of their individual lim sups.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

A series \\(\\Sigma a_n\\) converges if the sequence of its partial sums approaches a finite limit. In simpler terms, as we add more and more terms of the series, the total sum gets closer and closer to a specific number.\n\nNow, since \\(\\Sigma a_n\\) converges and each \\(a_n \\geq 0\\), it implies that the terms \\(a_n\\) must be getting smaller and smaller as \\(n\\) increases. Otherwise, the series wouldn't settle down to a finite sum.\n\nOur goal is to show that the series \\(\\sum \\frac{\\sqrt{a_n}}{n}\\) also converges. To do this, we can use a comparison test, which is a common technique for proving convergence. The idea is to compare the terms of our series with another series that we already know converges.\n\nSince \\(\\Sigma a_n\\) converges, the terms \\(a_n\\) must eventually become very small. Specifically, for large \\(n\\), \\(a_n\\) will be less than any positive number we choose, say \\(\\epsilon\\), because the series converges. This means that \\(\\sqrt{a_n}\\) will also become very small, since the square root of a small number is even smaller.\n\nNow, consider the series \\(\\sum \\frac{1}{n^2}\\), which is a well-known convergent series. For large \\(n\\), the terms \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{a_n}}{n}\\) can be compared to \\(\\frac{1}{n^2}\\). Since \\(\\sqrt{a_n}\\) becomes very small, we can make \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{a_n}}{n}\\) smaller than \\(\\frac{1}{n^2}\\) for sufficiently large \\(n\\).\n\nTherefore, by the comparison test, since \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{a_n}}{n} \\leq \\frac{1}{n^2}\\) for large \\(n\\) and \\(\\sum \\frac{1}{n^2}\\) converges, it follows that \\(\\sum \\frac{\\sqrt{a_n}}{n}\\) must also converge.\n\nIn summary, the convergence of \\(\\Sigma a_n\\) ensures that the terms \\(a_n\\) become small enough such that \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{a_n}}{n}\\) can be compared to a convergent series like \\(\\sum \\frac{1}{n^2}\\), leading to the conclusion that \\(\\sum \\frac{\\sqrt{a_n}}{n}\\) converges as well.\nPrevious attempt failed with: \nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: \nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ':='; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

This means that the series \\(\\sum |a_n|\\) and \\(\\sum |b_n|\\) both converge. The Cauchy product of these two series is another series, \\(\\sum c_n\\), where each term \\(c_n\\) is given by the sum of products of terms from the original series: \n\n\\[ c_n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k b_{n-k}. \\]\n\nOur goal is to show that the series \\(\\sum |c_n|\\) converges, which would mean that the Cauchy product converges absolutely.\n\nTo do this, we can use a result known as the Mertens' theorem, which states that if two series are absolutely convergent, then their Cauchy product is also absolutely convergent.

The absolute value of this term is:\n\n\\[ |c_n| = \\left| \\sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k b_{n-k} \\right| \\leq \\sum_{k=0}^{n} |a_k| |b_{n-k}|. \\]\n\nThis inequality comes from the triangle inequality, which allows us to take the absolute value inside the sum.\n\nTo show that \\(\\sum |c_n|\\) converges, we can use the fact that the double sum \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} |a_k| |b_j|\\) converges. This is because it can be rearranged as \\((\\sum |a_k|)(\\sum |b_j|)\\), which is finite since both series are absolutely convergent.\n\nThe key idea is that the terms \\(|a_k| |b_{n-k}|\\) are small for large \\(k\\) and \\(n-k\\) because both \\(|a_k|\\) and \\(|b_{n-k}|\\) become small as \\(k\\) and \\(n-k\\) increase, due to the absolute convergence of the original series. Therefore, the sum \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{n} |a_k| |b_{n-k}|\\) is bounded by a convergent series, ensuring that \\(\\sum |c_n|\\) converges.\n\nThus, the Cauchy product of two absolutely convergent series converges absolutely.\nPrevious attempt failed with: \nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: \nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: \nPlease revise the proof.",

We have a sequence of sets \\( \\{E_n\\} \\) in a complete metric space \\( X \\). Each set \\( E_n \\) is closed, nonempty, and bounded. The sequence is nested, meaning each set contains the next one: \\( E_n \\supset E_{n+1} \\). Additionally, the diameter of these sets, which is the greatest distance between any two points in a set, approaches zero as \\( n \\) goes to infinity.\n\nThe goal is to show that the intersection of all these sets, \\( \\bigcap_{n=1}^{\\infty} E_n \\), contains exactly one point.\n\nLet's start by considering what it means for the diameter of the sets to approach zero. If \\( \\operatorname{diam} E_n = 0 \\) as \\( n \\to \\infty \\), it means that for any small positive number \\( \\epsilon \\), there exists some \\( N \\) such that for all \\( n \\geq N \\), the diameter of \\( E_n \\) is less than \\( \\epsilon \\). This implies that the points in \\( E_n \\) are getting arbitrarily close to each other as \\( n \\) increases.\n\nSince each \\( E_n \\) is closed and nonempty, and the sets are nested, the intersection \\( \\bigcap_{n=1}^{\\infty} E_n \\) is nonempty. This is because each \\( E_n \\) contains at least one point, and since they are nested, there is at least one point common to all sets.\n\nNow, consider the completeness of the metric space \\( X \\). Completeness means that every Cauchy sequence in \\( X \\) converges to a point in \\( X \\). The condition that the diameters of the sets go to zero suggests that any sequence of points, one from each \\( E_n \\), is a Cauchy sequence. This is because the points can be chosen to be arbitrarily close to each other as \\( n \\) increases.\n\nSince \\( X \\) is complete, this Cauchy sequence converges to some point \\( x \\) in \\( X \\). Because the sets are nested and closed, this limit point \\( x \\) must be in every \\( E_n \\). Therefore, \\( x \\) is in the intersection \\( \\bigcap_{n=1}^{\\infty} E_n \\).\n\nFinally, we need to show that this intersection contains only this one point \\( x \\). Suppose there were another point \\( y \\) in the intersection. Then \\( y \\) would also be in every \\( E_n \\), and the distance between \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) would have to be less than the diameter of \\( E_n \\) for all \\( n \\). But since the diameter goes to zero, the distance between \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) must also be zero, implying \\( x = y \\).\n\nThus, the intersection \\( \\bigcap_{n=1}^{\\infty} E_n \\) consists of exactly one point, which is the limit of the Cauchy sequence formed by picking points from each \\( E_n \\).

Consider the set \\( E = \\{ x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid 0 < x \\leq 1 \\} \\), which is the open interval from 0 to 1, including 1 but not including 0. Now, define the function \\( f: E \\to \\mathbb{R} \\) by \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{x} \\).\n\nThe function \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{x} \\) is continuous on \\( E \\) because for any point \\( x_0 \\in E \\), as \\( x \\) approaches \\( x_0 \\), \\( f(x) \\) approaches \\( f(x_0) \\). However, if we try to extend \\( f \\) to include the point \\( x = 0 \\), we run into a problem. As \\( x \\) approaches 0 from the right (i.e., \\( x \\to 0^+ \\)), \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{x} \\) tends to infinity. This means that there is no real number that \\( f(x) \\) approaches as \\( x \\) approaches 0, which is a requirement for continuity at a point.\n\nTherefore, there is no way to define a continuous function \\( g \\) on the entire real line \\( \\mathbb{R} \\) such that \\( g(x) = f(x) \\) for all \\( x \\in E \\). Any attempt to define \\( g \\) at \\( x = 0 \\) would result in a discontinuity because \\( f(x) \\) does not approach any finite limit as \\( x \\to 0^+ \\).\n\nIn summary, the set \\( E = \\{ x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid 0 < x \\leq 1 \\} \\) and the function \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{x} \\) provide an example where \\( f \\) is continuous on \\( E \\), but cannot be extended to a continuous function on all of \\( \\mathbb{R} \\).

        "informal_proof": "# Informal Proof:\nTo show that a uniformly continuous function \\( f \\) on a bounded set \\( E \\) in \\( \\mathbb{R}^1 \\) is bounded, we need to understand the concepts of uniform continuity and boundedness.\n\nFirst, let's recall what it means for a function to be uniformly continuous. A function \\( f \\) is uniformly continuous on a set \\( E \\) if, for every small positive number \\( \\epsilon \\), there exists a corresponding small positive number \\( \\delta \\) such that for any two points \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) in \\( E \\), if the distance between \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) is less than \\( \\delta \\), then the distance between \\( f(x) \\) and \\( f(y) \\) is less than \\( \\epsilon \\). The key aspect of uniform continuity is that the choice of \\( \\delta \\) depends only on \\( \\epsilon \\) and not on the specific points \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n\nNext, consider what it means for a set to be bounded. A set \\( E \\) in \\( \\mathbb{R}^1 \\) is bounded if there exists a real number \\( M \\) such that every point \\( x \\) in \\( E \\) satisfies \\( |x| \\leq M \\).\n\nNow, let's combine these ideas to show that \\( f \\) is bounded on \\( E \\). Since \\( E \\) is bounded, it is contained within some interval \\([-M, M]\\) for a suitable \\( M \\). This means that \\( E \\) does not stretch out to infinity in either direction.\n\nSince \\( f \\) is uniformly continuous on \\( E \\), we can choose a small \\( \\epsilon = 1 \\) (or any positive number, really) and find a corresponding \\( \\delta \\) such that for any \\( x, y \\in E \\), if \\( |x - y| < \\delta \\), then \\( |f(x) - f(y)| < 1 \\).\n\nTo show that \\( f \\) is bounded, we can use the fact that \\( E \\) is bounded and closed (since it is a subset of a closed interval \\([-M, M]\\)). A closed and bounded set in \\( \\mathbb{R}^1 \\) is compact. By the Heine-Cantor theorem, a uniformly continuous function on a compact set is not only continuous but also bounded.\n\nTo see this more intuitively, consider covering the compact set \\( E \\) with a finite number of small intervals of length less than \\( \\delta \\). Since \\( E \\) is compact, we can cover it with finitely many such intervals. Within each interval, the function \\( f \\) does not vary by more than 1 unit (since \\( |f(x) - f(y)| < 1 \\) for points \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) within a distance \\( \\delta \\) of each other).\n\nNow, pick any point \\( x_0 \\) in \\( E \\) and consider the value \\( f(x_0) \\). Since \\( E \\) is covered by finitely many intervals, and within each interval, \\( f \\) does not vary by more than 1 unit, the values of \\( f \\) over the entire set \\( E \\) are confined to a finite range. Specifically, the maximum and minimum values of \\( f \\) over these intervals will be finite, ensuring that \\( f \\) is bounded on \\( E \\).\n\nThus, we conclude that \\( f \\) is bounded on the bounded set \\( E \\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: invalid field 'isBounded_image', the environment does not contain 'UniformContinuousOn.isBounded_image'\n  hf\nhas type\n  UniformContinuousOn f E\ninvalid field 'isBounded_image', the environment does not contain 'Filter.Tendsto.isBounded_image'\n  hf\nhas type\n  Tendsto (fun x => (f x.1, f x.2)) (uniformity \u211d \u2293 \ud835\udcdf (E \u00d7\u02e2 E)) (uniformity \u211d)\ninvalid field 'isBounded_image', the environment does not contain 'LE.le.isBounded_image'\n  hf\nhas type\n  Filter.map (fun x => (f x.1, f x.2)) (uniformity \u211d \u2293 \ud835\udcdf (E \u00d7\u02e2 E)) \u2264 uniformity \u211d\ninvalid field notation, type is not of the form (C ...) where C is a constant\n  hf\nhas type\n  ?m.264 \u2208 uniformity \u211d \u2192 ?m.264 \u2208 Filter.map (fun x => (f x.1, f x.2)) (uniformity \u211d \u2293 \ud835\udcdf (E \u00d7\u02e2 E))\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: invalid field 'isBounded_image', the environment does not contain 'Bornology.IsBounded.isBounded_image'\n  hE\nhas type\n  Bornology.IsBounded E\ninvalid field 'isBounded_image', the environment does not contain 'Bornology.IsCobounded.isBounded_image'\n  hE\nhas type\n  Bornology.IsCobounded E\u1d9c\ninvalid field 'isBounded_image', the environment does not contain 'Membership.mem.isBounded_image'\n  hE\nhas type\n  E\u1d9c \u2208 Bornology.cobounded \u211d\ninvalid field 'isBounded_image', the environment does not contain 'Membership.mem.isBounded_image'\n  hE\nhas type\n  E\u1d9c \u2208 (Bornology.cobounded \u211d).sets\ninvalid field 'isBounded_image', the environment does not contain 'Set.Mem.isBounded_image'\n  hE\nhas type\n  Set.Mem E\u1d9c (Bornology.cobounded \u211d).sets\ninvalid field 'isBounded_image', the environment does not contain 'Filter.sets.isBounded_image'\n  hE\nhas type\n  (Bornology.cobounded \u211d).sets E\u1d9c\ninvalid field 'isBounded_image', the environment does not contain 'setOf.isBounded_image'\n  hE\nhas type\n  {t | (fun x => x \u2208 {s | \u2203 C, \u2200 \u2983x : \u211d\u2984, x \u2208 s \u2192 \u2200 \u2983y : \u211d\u2984, y \u2208 s \u2192 (fun x y => |x - y|) x y \u2264 C}) t\u1d9c} E\u1d9c\ninvalid field 'isBounded_image', the environment does not contain 'Membership.mem.isBounded_image'\n  hE\nhas type\n  E\u1d9c\u1d9c \u2208 {s | \u2203 C, \u2200 \u2983x : \u211d\u2984, x \u2208 s \u2192 \u2200 \u2983y : \u211d\u2984, y \u2208 s \u2192 (fun x y => |x - y|) x y \u2264 C}\ninvalid field 'isBounded_image', the environment does not contain 'Set.Mem.isBounded_image'\n  hE\nhas type\n  Set.Mem E\u1d9c\u1d9c {s | \u2203 C, \u2200 \u2983x : \u211d\u2984, x \u2208 s \u2192 \u2200 \u2983y : \u211d\u2984, y \u2208 s \u2192 (fun x y => |x - y|) x y \u2264 C}\ninvalid field 'isBounded_image', the environment does not contain 'setOf.isBounded_image'\n  hE\nhas type\n  {s | \u2203 C, \u2200 \u2983x : \u211d\u2984, x \u2208 s \u2192 \u2200 \u2983y : \u211d\u2984, y \u2208 s \u2192 (fun x y => |x - y|) x y \u2264 C} E\u1d9c\u1d9c\ninvalid field 'isBounded_image', the environment does not contain 'Exists.isBounded_image'\n  hE\nhas type\n  \u2203 C, \u2200 \u2983x : \u211d\u2984, x \u2208 E\u1d9c\u1d9c \u2192 \u2200 \u2983y : \u211d\u2984, y \u2208 E\u1d9c\u1d9c \u2192 (fun x y => |x - y|) x y \u2264 C\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: invalid field 'isBounded_image', the environment does not contain 'UniformContinuousOn.isBounded_image'\n  hf\nhas type\n  UniformContinuousOn f E\ninvalid field 'isBounded_image', the environment does not contain 'Filter.Tendsto.isBounded_image'\n  hf\nhas type\n  Tendsto (fun x => (f x.1, f x.2)) (uniformity \u211d \u2293 \ud835\udcdf (E \u00d7\u02e2 E)) (uniformity \u211d)\ninvalid field 'isBounded_image', the environment does not contain 'LE.le.isBounded_image'\n  hf\nhas type\n  Filter.map (fun x => (f x.1, f x.2)) (uniformity \u211d \u2293 \ud835\udcdf (E \u00d7\u02e2 E)) \u2264 uniformity \u211d\ninvalid field notation, type is not of the form (C ...) where C is a constant\n  hf\nhas type\n  ?m.264 \u2208 uniformity \u211d \u2192 ?m.264 \u2208 Filter.map (fun x => (f x.1, f x.2)) (uniformity \u211d \u2293 \ud835\udcdf (E \u00d7\u02e2 E))\nPlease revise the proof.",

A sequence $\\{x_n\\}$ in a metric space $X$ is called a Cauchy sequence if, for every positive number $\\epsilon$, there exists a positive integer $N$ such that for all integers $m, n \\geq N$, the distance between $x_m$ and $x_n$ is less than $\\epsilon$. In simpler terms, the terms of the sequence get arbitrarily close to each other as the sequence progresses.\n\nNow, $f$ is a uniformly continuous function from $X$ to $Y$. Uniform continuity means that for every positive number $\\epsilon$, there exists a positive number $\\delta$ such that for any two points $x$ and $y$ in $X$, if the distance between $x$ and $y$ is less than $\\delta$, then the distance between $f(x)$ and $f(y)$ in $Y$ is less than $\\epsilon$. The key aspect of uniform continuity is that this $\\delta$ is chosen independently of the specific points $x$ and $y$; it only depends on $\\epsilon$.\n\nGiven that $\\{x_n\\}$ is a Cauchy sequence in $X$, for any positive $\\delta$, there exists an integer $N$ such that for all $m, n \\geq N$, the distance between $x_m$ and $x_n$ is less than $\\delta$.

By the uniform continuity of $f$, this implies that the distance between $f(x_m)$ and $f(x_n)$ is less than $\\epsilon$. This shows that $\\{f(x_n)\\}$ is a Cauchy sequence in $Y$ because for every positive $\\epsilon$, we can find an $N$ such that for all $m, n \\geq N$, the distance between $f(x_m)$ and $f(x_n)$ is less than $\\epsilon$.\n\nIn summary, the uniform continuity of $f$ ensures that the \"closeness\" of the terms in the sequence $\\{x_n\\}$ in $X$ is preserved when mapped to $Y$, making $\\{f(x_n)\\}$ a Cauchy sequence in $Y$.\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  UniformContinuous.comp hf hx\nargument\n  hx\nhas type\n  CauchySeq x : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  UniformContinuous ?m.1287 : Prop\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  UniformContinuous.comp hf hx\nargument\n  hx\nhas type\n  CauchySeq x : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  UniformContinuous ?m.1287 : Prop\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  UniformContinuous.comp hf hx\nargument\n  hx\nhas type\n  CauchySeq x : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  UniformContinuous ?m.1287 : Prop\nPlease revise the proof.",

A function \\( f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R} \\) is continuous if small changes in the input result in small changes in the output. It is open if it maps open sets to open sets, meaning that if you take any open interval in the domain, its image under \\( f \\) is an open set in the codomain. A function is monotonic if it is either entirely non-decreasing or non-increasing.\n\nNow, consider a continuous open mapping \\( f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R} \\). We want to show that \\( f \\) is monotonic. Let's assume for contradiction that \\( f \\) is not monotonic. This would mean there exist points \\( a < b < c \\) in \\( \\mathbb{R} \\) such that \\( f(a) > f(b) \\) and \\( f(b) < f(c) \\). This implies that \\( f \\) is neither non-decreasing nor non-increasing over the interval \\([a, c]\\).\n\nSince \\( f \\) is continuous, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, \\( f \\) must take every value between \\( f(a) \\) and \\( f(b) \\) on the interval \\([a, b]\\), and every value between \\( f(b) \\) and \\( f(c) \\) on the interval \\([b, c]\\). However, because \\( f \\) is open, the image of any open interval, such as \\((a, c)\\), must be an open set in \\( \\mathbb{R}\\). This means that the image should not have any \"gaps\" or isolated points, which would contradict the assumption that \\( f(a) > f(b) \\) and \\( f(b) < f(c) \\) without \\( f \\) being monotonic.\n\nTo further understand this, consider the image of the interval \\((a, c)\\). If \\( f \\) is not monotonic, the image would have to \"jump\" from \\( f(a) \\) to \\( f(b) \\) and then from \\( f(b) \\) to \\( f(c) \\), which would imply that the image is not an open interval, contradicting the openness of \\( f \\).\n\nThus, the assumption that \\( f \\) is not monotonic leads to a contradiction with the property of being an open mapping.

The key properties we will use are the compactness of \\( K \\) and the closedness of \\( F \\).\n\nFirst, let's understand what it means for \\( K \\) to be compact in a metric space. A set is compact if every open cover of the set has a finite subcover. In simpler terms, compact sets are \"small\" in a certain sense, and they have the property that they are closed and bounded.\n\nOn the other hand, \\( F \\) being closed means that it contains all its limit points. This implies that if a sequence of points in \\( F \\) converges to some point in the space, that point must also be in \\( F \\).\n\nNow, since \\( K \\) and \\( F \\) are disjoint, there is no point that is both in \\( K \\) and \\( F \\).

This inequality tells us that the difference in the function values \\( f(x) \\) and \\( f(y) \\) is bounded by the square of the difference in the inputs \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n\nLet's explore what this condition implies as \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) get very close to each other. Consider the case where \\( y = x + \\epsilon \\) for some small positive number \\( \\epsilon \\). Then, the inequality becomes:\n\n\\[ |f(x + \\epsilon) - f(x)| \\leq \\epsilon^2. \\]\n\nAs \\( \\epsilon \\) approaches zero, the right-hand side of the inequality, \\( \\epsilon^2 \\), also approaches zero. This means that the difference \\( |f(x + \\epsilon) - f(x)| \\) must also approach zero as \\( \\epsilon \\) becomes very small.\n\nIn other words, as \\( \\epsilon \\) gets smaller and smaller, the values of \\( f(x + \\epsilon) \\) and \\( f(x) \\) get arbitrarily close to each other.

Since this can be done for any \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), it follows that \\( f(a) = f(b) \\).\n\nTherefore, \\( f \\) must be constant across its entire domain.

This means that for very large values of \\( x \\), the rate of change of \\( f \\) is becoming negligible.\n\nLet's break down what this implies for \\( g(x) \\).

This directly implies that \\( g(x) = f(x+1) - f(x) \\rightarrow 0 \\) as \\( x \\rightarrow +\\infty \\).\n\nIn summary, because the derivative \\( f'(x) \\) approaches zero, the function \\( f \\) changes less and less over any fixed interval as \\( x \\) becomes large.

We know that \\( f \\) is three times differentiable on the interval \\([-1, 1]\\), and we have specific values and conditions at certain points: \\( f(-1) = 0 \\), \\( f(0) = 0 \\), \\( f(1) = 1 \\), and \\( f'(0) = 0 \\).\n\nFirst, let's consider the implications of these conditions. The fact that \\( f(-1) = 0 \\) and \\( f(0) = 0 \\) suggests that the function starts at zero at \\( x = -1 \\) and returns to zero at \\( x = 0 \\). Then, it rises to \\( f(1) = 1 \\). The condition \\( f'(0) = 0 \\) tells us that the slope of the tangent to the curve at \\( x = 0 \\) is horizontal, meaning there is a local extremum at this point.\n\nNow, let's apply the Mean Value Theorem (MVT) to the interval \\([-1, 0]\\). Since \\( f(-1) = f(0) = 0 \\), there must be some point \\( c \\) in \\((-1, 0)\\) where the first derivative \\( f'(c) = 0 \\). This is because the MVT guarantees that the average rate of change over the interval is zero, and thus the instantaneous rate of change (the derivative) must be zero at some point.\n\nNext, consider the interval \\([0, 1]\\). Here, \\( f(0) = 0 \\) and \\( f(1) = 1 \\). By the MVT, there exists some point \\( d \\) in \\((0, 1)\\) where \\( f'(d) = 1 \\). This tells us that the function is increasing at some point in this interval.\n\nNow, let's think about the second derivative, \\( f''(x) \\). Since \\( f'(0) = 0 \\) and \\( f'(d) = 1 \\), the derivative must increase from 0 to 1 as we move from \\( x = 0 \\) to \\( x = d \\). By the MVT applied to \\( f'(x) \\) over \\([0, d]\\), there exists some point \\( e \\) in \\((0, d)\\) where \\( f''(e) > 0 \\).\n\nFinally, consider the third derivative, \\( f^{(3)}(x) \\). We need to show that \\( f^{(3)}(x) \\geq 3 \\) for some \\( x \\in (-1, 1) \\). Since \\( f''(e) > 0 \\) and \\( f'(d) = 1 \\), the second derivative must be increasing at some point. By applying the MVT to \\( f''(x) \\) over an appropriate subinterval, we can find a point where the third derivative is positive and sufficiently large.\n\nTo ensure that \\( f^{(3)}(x) \\geq 3 \\), consider the overall change from \\( f(-1) = 0 \\) to \\( f(1) = 1 \\) with the given conditions. The function must curve upwards significantly to achieve this change, especially given the flatness at \\( x = 0 \\). The rapid increase in \\( f'(x) \\) from 0 to 1 and the positive \\( f''(x) \\) suggest that \\( f^{(3)}(x) \\) must be quite large at some point to accommodate these changes.\n\nThus, by considering the behavior of the derivatives and applying the Mean Value Theorem at various stages, we conclude that there must be some point \\( x \\in (-1, 1) \\) where \\( f^{(3)}(x) \\geq 3 \\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: unexpected end of input\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

In any group, each element \\( a \\) has a unique inverse \\( a^{-1} \\) such that \\( a \\cdot a^{-1} = e \\), where \\( e \\) is the identity element of the group.

This is a special property that doesn't generally hold in all groups, so it gives us a strong hint about the structure of \\(G\\).\n\nOur goal is to show that \\((aba^{-1}b^{-1})^{n(n-1)} = e\\), where \\(e\\) is the identity element of the group \\(G\\).\n\nFirst, let's explore what \\((ab)^n = a^n b^n\\) implies. Normally, in a group, \\((ab)^n\\) would expand using the binomial theorem, involving mixed terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). However, the given condition simplifies this to just \\(a^n b^n\\), suggesting a high level of commutativity between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) when raised to the power \\(n\\).\n\nNow, consider the element \\(aba^{-1}b^{-1}\\). This is known as the commutator of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and it measures how much \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) fail to commute. If \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) commute, then \\(aba^{-1}b^{-1} = e\\).\n\nGiven the condition \\((ab)^n = a^n b^n\\), let's see what happens when we apply it to the commutator. We can rewrite the commutator as:\n\\[\n(aba^{-1}b^{-1})^n = (ab)^n (ba)^{-n}\n\\]\nUsing the given property, \\((ab)^n = a^n b^n\\) and \\((ba)^n = b^n a^n\\). Therefore:\n\\[\n(aba^{-1}b^{-1})^n = a^n b^n (b^n a^n)^{-1} = a^n b^n a^{-n} b^{-n}\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\na^n b^n a^{-n} b^{-n} = (a^n a^{-n})(b^n b^{-n}) = e\n\\]\nThus, \\((aba^{-1}b^{-1})^n = e\\).\n\nNow, we need to show that \\((aba^{-1}b^{-1})^{n(n-1)} = e\\). Since we have already shown that \\((aba^{-1}b^{-1})^n = e\\), raising this to the power of \\(n-1\\) will still yield the identity element because:\n\\[\n((aba^{-1}b^{-1})^n)^{n-1} = e^{n-1} = e\n\\]\nThis is because any power of the identity element \\(e\\) is still \\(e\\).\n\nTherefore, we have shown that \\((aba^{-1}b^{-1})^{n(n-1)} = e\\) for all \\(a, b \\in G\\), completing the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  ?a * (?b * ?c)\nG : Type u_1\ninst\u271d : Group G\nn : \u2115\nhn : n > 1\nh : \u2200 (a b : G), (a * b) ^ n = a ^ n * b ^ n\na b : G\n\u22a2 a ^ n * (a * b * a\u207b\u00b9 * b\u207b\u00b9) ^ n = a ^ n * 1\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  ?a * (?b * ?c)\nG : Type u_1\ninst\u271d : Group G\nn : \u2115\nhn : n > 1\nh : \u2200 (a b : G), (a * b) ^ n = a ^ n * b ^ n\na b : G\n\u22a2 a ^ n * (a * b * a\u207b\u00b9 * b\u207b\u00b9) ^ n = a ^ n * 1\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  ?a * (?b * ?c)\nG : Type u_1\ninst\u271d : Group G\nn : \u2115\nhn : n > 1\nh : \u2200 (a b : G), (a * b) ^ n = a ^ n * b ^ n\na b : G\n\u22a2 a ^ n * (a * b * a\u207b\u00b9 * b\u207b\u00b9) ^ n = a ^ n * 1\nPlease revise the proof.",

A proper subgroup of a group $G$ is any subgroup $H$ of $G$ such that $H$ is not equal to $G$ itself and $H$ is not the trivial subgroup (which contains only the identity element). If $G$ has no proper subgroups, the only subgroups it can have are the trivial subgroup and $G$ itself.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications of this condition. If $G$ has no proper subgroups, it means that for any element $g$ in $G$, the subgroup generated by $g$, denoted $\\langle g \\rangle$, must either be the trivial subgroup or the whole group $G$. This is because if $\\langle g \\rangle$ were a proper subgroup, it would contradict the assumption that $G$ has no proper subgroups.\n\nNext, let's consider the size of the group $G$. If $G$ is finite, say of order $n$, then by Lagrange's Theorem, the order of any subgroup of $G$ must divide the order of $G$. Since the only subgroups of $G$ are the trivial subgroup and $G$ itself, the order of $G$ must be such that no other divisors exist except 1 and $n$. This means $n$ must be a prime number, say $p$. \n\nNow, if $G$ is of order $p$, a prime number, then by definition, $G$ is a cyclic group. This is because any group of prime order is cyclic, generated by any of its non-identity elements. In a cyclic group of prime order, every non-identity element generates the entire group, which aligns perfectly with our condition that $G$ has no proper subgroups.\n\nTherefore, if a group $G$ has no proper subgroups, it must be cyclic of order $p$, where $p$ is a prime number. This is because the absence of proper subgroups forces the group to be of prime order, and any group of prime order is necessarily cyclic.\n\nIn summary, the condition that $G$ has no proper subgroups leads us to conclude that $G$ is a cyclic group of prime order, as any other structure would allow for the existence of proper subgroups, contradicting the given condition.\nPrevious attempt failed with: \nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: rcases tactic failed: h : IsCyclic G \u2192 False is not an inductive datatype\nrcases tactic failed: h : (orderOf g).Prime \u2192 False is not an inductive datatype\napplication type mismatch\n  ZMod.ringEquiv G g\nargument\n  g\nhas type\n  G : Type u_1\nbut is expected to have type\n  card G = ?m.2519 : Prop\nfailed to synthesize\n  Ring G\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  Fintype (ZMod (orderOf g))\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nunknown identifier 'h1'\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: rcases tactic failed: h : IsCyclic G \u2192 False is not an inductive datatype\nfailed to synthesize\n  Fintype G\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nunknown constant 'Nat.prime_of_card_univ'\nunknown identifier 'h1'\nfailed to synthesize\n  Fintype G\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nPlease revise the proof.",

A subgroup \\( H \\) of \\( G \\) is normal if for every element \\( g \\) in \\( G \\), the left coset \\( gH \\) is the same as the right coset \\( Hg \\). In simpler terms, this means that conjugating any element of \\( H \\) by any element of \\( G \\) results in an element that is still in \\( H \\).\n\nNow, let's consider the implications of every subgroup of \\( G \\) being normal. In particular, let's look at the subgroup generated by a single element, say \\( \\langle a \\rangle \\), which consists of all powers of \\( a \\). Since \\( \\langle a \\rangle \\) is a subgroup of \\( G \\), it must be normal in \\( G \\). This means that for any element \\( b \\) in \\( G \\), the conjugate \\( bab^{-1} \\) must also be in \\( \\langle a \\rangle \\).\n\nSince \\( bab^{-1} \\) is in \\( \\langle a \\rangle \\), it can be expressed as a power of \\( a \\). In other words, there exists some integer \\( j \\) such that \\( bab^{-1} = a^j \\). Rearranging this equation gives us \\( ba = a^j b \\).\n\nThis result shows that for any two elements \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) in \\( G \\), the product \\( ba \\) can be rewritten as \\( a^j b \\) for some integer \\( j \\). This property is a characteristic of abelian groups, where elements commute up to a power, and it suggests that \\( G \\) has a structure that is very close to being abelian.\n\nIn summary, the condition that all subgroups of \\( G \\) are normal forces the group to behave in a way where elements almost commute, specifically allowing us to express \\( ba \\) as \\( a^j b \\) for some integer \\( j \\).

Since \\( G \\) is an abelian group of order \\( p^n m \\) where \\( p \\nmid m \\), we can apply the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups. This theorem tells us that \\( G \\) can be expressed as a direct product of cyclic groups whose orders are powers of primes.

Since \\( H \\) is a \\( p \\)-subgroup and \\( G \\) is abelian, \\( H \\) must be contained within the \\( p \\)-Sylow subgroup \\( P \\) of \\( G \\). In fact, since \\( H \\) and \\( P \\) have the same order \\( p^n \\), \\( H \\) is exactly the \\( p \\)-Sylow subgroup \\( P \\).\n\nNext, we need to show that \\( H \\) is characteristic in \\( G \\). A subgroup is characteristic if it is invariant under all automorphisms of the group. Since \\( G \\) is abelian, any automorphism of \\( G \\) respects the direct product structure \\( G \\cong P \\times M \\). This means that any automorphism of \\( G \\) will map the \\( p \\)-Sylow subgroup \\( P \\) to itself because \\( P \\) is the unique subgroup of \\( G \\) of order \\( p^n \\).\n\nThe uniqueness of the \\( p \\)-Sylow subgroup \\( P \\) in \\( G \\) is crucial here. Since \\( p \\) does not divide \\( m \\), there are no other subgroups of order \\( p^n \\) in \\( G \\) apart from \\( P \\).

        "informal_proof": "# Informal Proof:\nTo prove that a group of order 9 must be abelian, we start by considering the properties of groups and the specific characteristics of the number 9. \n\nFirst, note that the order of the group, which is the number of elements in the group, is 9. The number 9 can be expressed as \\(3^2\\), which means it is a power of a prime number (in this case, the prime number 3). This is important because it allows us to apply a result from group theory known as the Sylow theorems.\n\nAccording to the Sylow theorems, a group of order \\(p^n\\) (where \\(p\\) is a prime and \\(n\\) is a positive integer) has a subgroup of order \\(p^k\\) for every \\(k\\) such that \\(0 \\leq k \\leq n\\). In our case, since the group has order \\(3^2 = 9\\), it must have subgroups of order \\(3^0 = 1\\), \\(3^1 = 3\\), and \\(3^2 = 9\\). The subgroup of order 1 is trivial (just the identity element), and the subgroup of order 9 is the group itself.\n\nThe key point here is the subgroup of order 3. By the Sylow theorems, the number of such subgroups, denoted as \\(n_3\\), must satisfy the condition \\(n_3 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}\\) and also divide the order of the group, which is 9. The divisors of 9 are 1, 3, and 9. The only number that satisfies both \\(n_3 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}\\) and divides 9 is 1. Therefore, there is exactly one subgroup of order 3.\n\nHaving exactly one subgroup of order 3 is significant because it implies that this subgroup is normal in the group. A normal subgroup is one that is invariant under conjugation by any element of the group, which means it behaves nicely with respect to the group structure.\n\nNow, consider the structure of the group. Since the group has a normal subgroup of order 3, and the quotient of the group by this normal subgroup also has order 3 (because 9 divided by 3 is 3), both the subgroup and the quotient group are cyclic. A cyclic group is always abelian because it is generated by a single element, and all elements can be expressed as powers of this generator, which commute with each other.\n\nFinally, a group that can be expressed as an extension of two cyclic groups (one being the normal subgroup and the other being the quotient group) is itself abelian. This is because the interactions between the elements of the subgroup and the quotient group do not introduce any non-commutative behavior.\n\nTherefore, we conclude that a group of order 9 must be abelian, as it can be decomposed into cyclic components that ensure commutativity.\nPrevious attempt failed with: expected ';' or line break\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: expected ';' or line break\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: expected ';' or line break\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

Consequently, this will imply that \\(G\\) is abelian.\n\nFirst, let's understand what it means for \\(\\varphi(x) = x^{-1}\\). An automorphism is a bijective homomorphism from a group to itself, meaning it preserves the group operation and is both injective and surjective. The condition \\(\\varphi(x) = x^{-1}\\) means that \\(\\varphi\\) maps each element to its inverse.\n\nNow, consider the set \\(S = \\{ x \\in G \\mid \\varphi(x) = x^{-1} \\}\\). We are given that the size of \\(S\\) is more than three-fourths of the size of \\(G\\). Let's denote the size of \\(G\\) by \\(|G|\\). Therefore, \\(|S| > \\frac{3}{4}|G|\\).\n\nNext, consider any element \\(y \\in G\\) that is not in \\(S\\), meaning \\(\\varphi(y) \\neq y^{-1}\\). We will show that such an element cannot exist if \\(|S| > \\frac{3}{4}|G|\\).\n\nFor any element \\(y \\in G\\), consider the element \\(z = \\varphi(y)y\\). If \\(\\varphi(y) = y^{-1}\\), then \\(z = e\\), the identity element, because \\(y^{-1}y = e\\). If \\(\\varphi(y) \\neq y^{-1}\\), then \\(z \\neq e\\).\n\nNow, let's count the number of elements \\(z\\) that can be formed this way. Since \\(\\varphi\\) is an automorphism, it is bijective, and thus for each \\(y\\), there is a unique \\(z\\). If \\(\\varphi(y) \\neq y^{-1}\\), then \\(z \\neq e\\), and these elements \\(z\\) are distinct from the identity.\n\nThe key observation is that if there are more than \\(\\frac{3}{4}|G|\\) elements \\(x\\) such that \\(\\varphi(x) = x^{-1}\\), then there are fewer than \\(\\frac{1}{4}|G|\\) elements \\(y\\) for which \\(\\varphi(y) \\neq y^{-1}\\). This means that the number of non-identity elements \\(z\\) is less than \\(\\frac{1}{4}|G|\\).\n\nHowever, for each \\(y\\) where \\(\\varphi(y) \\neq y^{-1}\\), we get a distinct non-identity element \\(z\\). Since there are fewer than \\(\\frac{1}{4}|G|\\) such \\(z\\), and they must be distinct, this implies that there are not enough elements in \\(G\\) to accommodate all these distinct non-identity \\(z\\). This contradiction implies that no such \\(y\\) can exist, and thus \\(\\varphi(y) = y^{-1}\\) for all \\(y \\in G\\).\n\nFinally, if \\(\\varphi(y) = y^{-1}\\) for all \\(y \\in G\\), then for any two elements \\(a, b \\in G\\), we have \\(\\varphi(ab) = (ab)^{-1} = b^{-1}a^{-1}\\). But since \\(\\varphi\\) is a homomorphism, \\(\\varphi(ab) = \\varphi(a)\\varphi(b) = a^{-1}b^{-1}\\). Therefore, \\(b^{-1}a^{-1} = a^{-1}b^{-1}\\), which implies \\(ab = ba\\).

We need to show that for any element \\(g' \\in G'\\) and any element \\(n' \\in \\varphi(N)\\), the element \\(g' n' (g')^{-1}\\) is also in \\(\\varphi(N)\\).\n\nSince \\(\\varphi\\) is onto, for any \\(g' \\in G'\\), there exists some \\(g \\in G\\) such that \\(\\varphi(g) = g'\\). Similarly, since \\(n' \\in \\varphi(N)\\), there exists some \\(n \\in N\\) such that \\(\\varphi(n) = n'\\).\n\nNow, consider the element \\(g' n' (g')^{-1}\\). Substituting the expressions for \\(g'\\) and \\(n'\\), we have:\n\\[ g' n' (g')^{-1} = \\varphi(g) \\varphi(n) \\varphi(g)^{-1}. \\]\n\nUsing the property of homomorphisms, which preserve the group operation, we can rewrite this as:\n\\[ \\varphi(g n g^{-1}). \\]\n\nSince \\(N\\) is normal in \\(G\\), the element \\(g n g^{-1}\\) is in \\(N\\). Therefore, \\(\\varphi(g n g^{-1})\\) is in \\(\\varphi(N)\\).\n\nThus, for any \\(g' \\in G'\\) and any \\(n' \\in \\varphi(N)\\), the element \\(g' n' (g')^{-1}\\) is in \\(\\varphi(N)\\). This shows that \\(\\varphi(N)\\) is closed under conjugation by elements of \\(G'\\), which means \\(\\varphi(N)\\) is normal in \\(G'\\).\n\nTherefore, we have shown that if \\(\\varphi\\) is a homomorphism of \\(G\\) onto \\(G'\\) and \\(N \\triangleleft G\\), then \\(\\varphi(N) \\triangleleft G'\\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  (Subgroup.map \u03c6 N).Normal\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  (Subgroup.map \u03c6 N).Normal\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  (Subgroup.map \u03c6 N).Normal\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nPlease revise the proof.",

The condition \\( q \\mid (p - 1) \\) is crucial because it allows us to apply certain group theory results about the existence and uniqueness of nonabelian groups of this order.\n\nFirst, let's recall a fundamental result from group theory: if a group \\( G \\) has order \\( pq \\) with \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) being distinct primes, then \\( G \\) can either be abelian or nonabelian. If \\( G \\) is abelian, it is isomorphic to the cyclic group \\( \\mathbb{Z}_{pq} \\). However, we are interested in the nonabelian case.\n\nFor a nonabelian group of order \\( pq \\), the structure is more specific. The condition \\( q \\mid (p - 1) \\) implies that there is a subgroup of order \\( q \\) in the multiplicative group of integers modulo \\( p \\), denoted as \\( (\\mathbb{Z}_p)^* \\). This subgroup corresponds to the automorphisms of a cyclic group of order \\( p \\).\n\nNow, consider the Sylow theorems, which help us understand the subgroup structure of \\( G \\). The number of Sylow \\( p \\)-subgroups, denoted \\( n_p \\), must divide \\( q \\) and be congruent to 1 modulo \\( p \\). Since \\( q \\) is a prime, the divisors of \\( q \\) are 1 and \\( q \\). If \\( n_p = 1 \\), then there is a unique Sylow \\( p \\)-subgroup, which would imply that \\( G \\) is not simple and has a normal subgroup of order \\( p \\). However, for nonabelian groups, we typically have \\( n_p = q \\).\n\nSimilarly, the number of Sylow \\( q \\)-subgroups, \\( n_q \\), must divide \\( p \\) and be congruent to 1 modulo \\( q \\). The divisors of \\( p \\) are 1 and \\( p \\). If \\( n_q = 1 \\), then there is a unique Sylow \\( q \\)-subgroup, which would also imply a normal subgroup of order \\( q \\).\n\nThe condition \\( q \\mid (p - 1) \\) ensures that there is a nontrivial homomorphism from a cyclic group of order \\( q \\) into the automorphism group of a cyclic group of order \\( p \\). This allows the construction of a semidirect product, which is a nonabelian group of order \\( pq \\).\n\nThe key point is that under these conditions, there is essentially only one way to construct such a nonabelian group, up to isomorphism. This is because the semidirect product is determined by the action of the subgroup of order \\( q \\) on the subgroup of order \\( p \\), and the condition \\( q \\mid (p - 1) \\) ensures that this action is unique.\n\nTherefore, any two nonabelian groups of order \\( pq \\) are isomorphic because they are both isomorphic to this unique semidirect product. This completes the proof that any two nonabelian groups of order \\( pq \\) are indeed isomorphic when \\( q \\mid (p - 1) \\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: \nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'NonabelianGroupOfOrderPQ'\nunknown identifier 'NonabelianGroupOfOrderPQ'\ninvalid field notation, type is not of the form (C ...) where C is a constant\n  \u03d5\nhas type\n  ?m.1542\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

This means that the smallest positive integer \\( n \\) such that \\( b^n = e \\) is \\( p \\). Therefore, the subgroup \\( (b) \\) consists of the elements \\( \\{ e, b, b^2, \\ldots, b^{p-1} \\} \\).\n\nNow, consider the intersection \\( A \\cap (b) \\). This intersection consists of all elements that are both in \\( A \\) and in \\( (b) \\). We want to show that the only element in this intersection is the identity element \\( e \\).\n\nSuppose, for the sake of contradiction, that there is some element \\( b^k \\) in \\( A \\cap (b) \\) where \\( 1 \\leq k < p \\).

A \\( p \\)-Sylow subgroup \\( P \\) of a group \\( G \\) is a maximal subgroup whose order is a power of a prime \\( p \\). This means that \\( P \\) is as large as possible while still having an order that is a power of \\( p \\).\n\nNow, the problem states that \\( P \\triangleleft G \\), meaning \\( P \\) is a normal subgroup of \\( G \\). This is a crucial point because normality implies that \\( P \\) is invariant under conjugation by any element of \\( G \\). In other words, for any \\( g \\in G \\) and any \\( p \\in P \\), the element \\( gpg^{-1} \\) is still in \\( P \\).\n\nNext, consider an automorphism \\( \\varphi \\) of \\( G \\). An automorphism is a bijective homomorphism from \\( G \\) to itself. Since \\( \\varphi \\) is a homomorphism, it respects the group operation, and because it is bijective, it has an inverse that is also a homomorphism.\n\nThe goal is to show that \\( \\varphi(P) = P \\). Since \\( P \\) is normal in \\( G \\), it is invariant under conjugation by any element of \\( G \\). Automorphisms, being more general than conjugations, also preserve the structure of the group, including its normal subgroups. Therefore, \\( \\varphi(P) \\) must also be a subgroup of \\( G \\) with the same order as \\( P \\).\n\nSince \\( \\varphi \\) is an automorphism, it maps subgroups of \\( G \\) to subgroups of the same order. Thus, \\( \\varphi(P) \\) is a subgroup of \\( G \\) with the same order as \\( P \\). But \\( P \\) is a \\( p \\)-Sylow subgroup, which means it is the largest subgroup of \\( G \\) whose order is a power of \\( p \\). By Sylow's theorems, all \\( p \\)-Sylow subgroups of \\( G \\) are conjugate to each other, but since \\( P \\) is normal, it is the only \\( p \\)-Sylow subgroup of \\( G \\) that is invariant under all automorphisms.\n\nTherefore, \\( \\varphi(P) \\) must be \\( P \\) itself because there is no other \\( p \\)-Sylow subgroup of the same order that \\( \\varphi(P) \\) could be. Hence, for every automorphism \\( \\varphi \\) of \\( G \\), we have \\( \\varphi(P) = P \\).\n\nIn summary, the normality of \\( P \\) in \\( G \\) ensures that it is invariant under all automorphisms of \\( G \\), and the properties of \\( p \\)-Sylow subgroups guarantee that \\( \\varphi(P) \\) cannot be anything other than \\( P \\) itself.

We have two permutations, $\\sigma$ and $\\tau$, which are functions that rearrange elements of a set. The statement that they \"disturb no common element\" means that if $\\sigma$ changes the position of an element, then $\\tau$ leaves that element in its original position, and vice versa. Additionally, we are given that the composition of these two permutations, $\\sigma \\tau$, is the identity permutation $e$, which means that applying $\\sigma$ followed by $\\tau$ results in no change to any element.\n\nOur goal is to show that both $\\sigma$ and $\\tau$ must themselves be the identity permutation, meaning they do not change any elements at all.\n\nLet's break this down:\n\n1. **Understanding the Composition $\\sigma \\tau = e$:**\n   - The composition $\\sigma \\tau = e$ implies that for every element $x$ in the set, applying $\\sigma$ and then $\\tau$ returns $x$ to its original position. In other words, $\\tau(\\sigma(x)) = x$ for all $x$.\n\n2. **No Common Disturbance:**\n   - The condition that $\\sigma$ and $\\tau$ disturb no common element means that if $\\sigma(x) \\neq x$, then $\\tau(x) = x$, and if $\\tau(x) \\neq x$, then $\\sigma(x) = x$. This means that $\\sigma$ and $\\tau$ cannot both change the position of the same element.\n\n3. **Analyzing the Implications:**\n   - Suppose, for contradiction, that $\\sigma$ is not the identity permutation. This means there exists some element $a$ such that $\\sigma(a) \\neq a$. By the no common disturbance condition, $\\tau(a)$ must equal $a$ because $\\sigma$ has already disturbed $a$.\n   - Now, consider $\\tau(\\sigma(a))$. Since $\\sigma(a) \\neq a$, $\\sigma(a)$ is a different element, say $b$. For $\\sigma \\tau = e$, we need $\\tau(b) = a$. But since $\\tau$ does not disturb $a$, it must be that $\\tau(a) = a$, and thus $\\tau(b) = b$.\n   - This leads to a contradiction because we need $\\tau(b) = a$ for $\\sigma \\tau = e$, but we also have $\\tau(b) = b$ from the no common disturbance condition.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The contradiction arises from assuming that $\\sigma$ is not the identity permutation. Therefore, $\\sigma$ must be the identity permutation, meaning it does not change any element.\n   - Similarly, if we assume $\\tau$ is not the identity permutation, a similar contradiction arises, forcing $\\tau$ to also be the identity permutation.\n\nThus, the only way for $\\sigma \\tau = e$ to hold under the condition that $\\sigma$ and $\\tau$ disturb no common element is for both $\\sigma$ and $\\tau$ to be the identity permutation. Therefore, $\\sigma = \\tau = e$.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  \u21d1\u03c4 \u2218 \u21d1\u03c3\n\u03b1 : Type u_1\ninst\u271d : Fintype \u03b1\n\u03c3 \u03c4 : Equiv.Perm \u03b1\nh1 : \u2200 (a : \u03b1), \u03c3 a = a \u2194 \u03c4 a \u2260 a\nh2 : \u21d1\u03c4 \u2218 \u21d1\u03c3 = id\na : \u03b1\nh4 : \u03c3 a = a \u2194 \u03c4 a \u2260 a\n\u22a2 \u03c4 (\u03c3 a) = a\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  \u03c4 a\ncase mp\n\u03b1 : Type u_1\ninst\u271d : Fintype \u03b1\n\u03c3 \u03c4 : Equiv.Perm \u03b1\nh1 : \u2200 (a : \u03b1), \u03c3 a = a \u2194 \u03c4 a \u2260 a\nh2 : \u21d1\u03c4 \u2218 \u21d1\u03c3 = id\na : \u03b1\nh4 : \u03c3 a = a \u2194 \u03c4 a \u2260 a\nh5 : \u03c4 (\u03c3 a) = a\nh7 : \u03c4 a = a\n\u22a2 \u03c3 (\u03c4 (\u03c3 a)) \u2260 \u03c4 (\u03c3 a)\napplication type mismatch\n  h6.mpr h7\nargument\n  h7\nhas type\n  \u03c3 a = a : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u03c3 a \u2260 a : Prop\napplication type mismatch\n  h4.mpr h7\nargument\n  h7\nhas type\n  \u03c4 a = a : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u03c4 a \u2260 a : Prop\ntactic 'apply' failed, failed to unify\n  \u03c3 a = a\nwith\n  \u03c4 a = a\n\u03b1 : Type u_1\ninst\u271d : Fintype \u03b1\n\u03c3 \u03c4 : Equiv.Perm \u03b1\nh1 : \u2200 (a : \u03b1), \u03c3 a = a \u2194 \u03c4 a \u2260 a\nh2 : \u21d1\u03c4 \u2218 \u21d1\u03c3 = id\nh3 : \u2200 (a : \u03b1), \u03c3 a = a \u2194 \u03c4 a = a\na : \u03b1\nh8 : \u03c3 a = a \u2194 \u03c4 a = a\n\u22a2 \u03c4 a = a\ntype mismatch\n  h9\nhas type\n  \u03c4 a = a : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u03c3 a = a : Prop\napplication type mismatch\n  h11.mpr h12\nargument\n  h12\nhas type\n  \u03c3 a = a : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u03c4 a = a : Prop\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'rewrite' failed, pattern is a metavariable\n  ?m.721 (?m.722 ?m.723)\nfrom equation\n  ?m.721 (?m.722 ?m.723) = (?m.721 \u2218 ?m.722) ?m.723\n\u03b1 : Type u_1\ninst\u271d : Fintype \u03b1\n\u03c3 \u03c4 : Equiv.Perm \u03b1\nh1 : \u2200 (a : \u03b1), \u03c3 a = a \u2194 \u03c4 a \u2260 a\nh2 : \u21d1\u03c4 \u2218 \u21d1\u03c3 = id\na : \u03b1\nh4 : \u03c3 a = a \u2194 \u03c4 a \u2260 a\n\u22a2 \u03c4 (\u03c3 a) = a\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  \u03c4 a\ncase mpr\n\u03b1 : Type u_1\ninst\u271d : Fintype \u03b1\n\u03c3 \u03c4 : Equiv.Perm \u03b1\nh1 : \u2200 (a : \u03b1), \u03c3 a = a \u2194 \u03c4 a \u2260 a\nh2 : \u21d1\u03c4 \u2218 \u21d1\u03c3 = id\na : \u03b1\nh4 : \u03c3 a = a \u2194 \u03c4 a \u2260 a\nh5 : \u03c4 (\u03c3 a) = a\nh6 : \u03c4 a = a\n\u22a2 \u03c3 a = a\ninvalid alternative name 'inl'\ninvalid alternative name 'inl'\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'rewrite' failed, pattern is a metavariable\n  ?m.721 (?m.722 ?m.723)\nfrom equation\n  ?m.721 (?m.722 ?m.723) = (?m.721 \u2218 ?m.722) ?m.723\n\u03b1 : Type u_1\ninst\u271d : Fintype \u03b1\n\u03c3 \u03c4 : Equiv.Perm \u03b1\nh1 : \u2200 (a : \u03b1), \u03c3 a = a \u2194 \u03c4 a \u2260 a\nh2 : \u21d1\u03c4 \u2218 \u21d1\u03c3 = id\na : \u03b1\nh4 : \u03c3 a = a \u2194 \u03c4 a \u2260 a\n\u22a2 \u03c4 (\u03c3 a) = a\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  \u03c4 a\ncase mpr\n\u03b1 : Type u_1\ninst\u271d : Fintype \u03b1\n\u03c3 \u03c4 : Equiv.Perm \u03b1\nh1 : \u2200 (a : \u03b1), \u03c3 a = a \u2194 \u03c4 a \u2260 a\nh2 : \u21d1\u03c4 \u2218 \u21d1\u03c3 = id\na : \u03b1\nh4 : \u03c3 a = a \u2194 \u03c4 a \u2260 a\nh5 : \u03c4 (\u03c3 a) = a\nh6 : \u03c4 a = a\n\u22a2 \u03c3 a = a\napplication type mismatch\n  (h3 a).mp (h1 a).mp\nargument\n  (h1 a).mp\nhas type\n  \u03c3 a = a \u2192 \u03c4 a \u2260 a : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u03c3 a = a : Prop\napplication type mismatch\n  (h3 a).mpr (h1 a).mpr\nargument\n  (h1 a).mpr\nhas type\n  \u03c4 a \u2260 a \u2192 \u03c3 a = a : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u03c4 a = a : Prop\nPlease revise the proof.",

The field \\(\\mathbb{Z}_2\\) consists of two elements: 0 and 1. A \\( 2 \\times 2 \\) matrix over \\(\\mathbb{Z}_2\\) is invertible if its determinant is non-zero. The determinant of a matrix \\(\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix}\\) is given by \\( ad - bc \\).

We need to count how many such matrices exist. Each entry of the matrix can be either 0 or 1, giving us \\( 2^4 = 16 \\) possible matrices.

The 3-cycles \\((123)\\) and \\((132)\\).\n\nBoth \\( T \\) and \\( S_3 \\) have 6 elements, suggesting a possible isomorphism. To establish this, we need to find a way to map matrices in \\( T \\) to permutations in \\( S_3 \\) such that the group operation (matrix multiplication in \\( T \\) and permutation composition in \\( S_3 \\)) is preserved.\n\nOne way to see this is to consider the action of these matrices on the set of non-zero vectors in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_2^2\\). There are three such vectors: \\((1,0)\\), \\((0,1)\\), and \\((1,1)\\). Each invertible matrix permutes these vectors, and this permutation can be associated with an element of \\( S_3 \\).\n\nFor example:\n- The identity matrix \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\) corresponds to the identity permutation.\n- The matrix \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\) swaps \\((1,0)\\) and \\((0,1)\\), corresponding to the transposition \\((12)\\).\n\nBy checking each matrix, we can establish a bijection between the matrices in \\( T \\) and the permutations in \\( S_3 \\) that respects the group operation. Thus, \\( T \\) is isomorphic to \\( S_3 \\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  Mul S3\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  Mul S3\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unexpected identifier; expected '}'\nfailed to synthesize\n  Mul S3\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nPlease revise the proof.",

A number \\( a \\) is called a quadratic residue modulo \\( p \\) if there exists an integer \\( x \\) such that \\( x^2 \\equiv a \\pmod{p} \\). If no such \\( x \\) exists, then \\( a \\) is a quadratic nonresidue modulo \\( p \\).\n\nLet's consider the set of numbers \\( 1, 2, \\ldots, p-1 \\). We want to show that exactly half of these numbers are quadratic residues and the other half are quadratic nonresidues modulo \\( p \\).\n\nFirst, note that since \\( p \\) is a prime, the numbers \\( 1, 2, \\ldots, p-1 \\) form a complete set of residues modulo \\( p \\). Now, consider the set of squares of these numbers: \\( 1^2, 2^2, \\ldots, (p-1)^2 \\). These squares are also residues modulo \\( p \\).\n\nA key observation is that if \\( x^2 \\equiv y^2 \\pmod{p} \\), then \\( (x-y)(x+y) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p} \\). Since \\( p \\) is prime, this implies either \\( x \\equiv y \\pmod{p} \\) or \\( x \\equiv -y \\pmod{p} \\). Therefore, each non-zero square \\( x^2 \\) has exactly two distinct numbers \\( x \\) and \\( -x \\) (where \\( x \\neq -x \\)) that map to it, except when \\( x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p} \\), which is not possible since \\( x \\) ranges from \\( 1 \\) to \\( p-1 \\).\n\nThis means that the mapping from numbers to their squares is a two-to-one mapping, except for the case when \\( x \\equiv -x \\pmod{p} \\), which happens only when \\( x \\equiv (p-x) \\pmod{p} \\). This occurs when \\( x = (p-x) \\), or \\( 2x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p} \\), which is impossible for \\( x \\) in the range \\( 1 \\) to \\( p-1 \\) because \\( p \\) is prime and does not divide \\( 2 \\).\n\nThus, the set of squares \\( \\{1^2, 2^2, \\ldots, (p-1)^2\\} \\) contains exactly \\((p-1)/2\\) distinct elements, each appearing twice. These distinct elements are the quadratic residues modulo \\( p \\).\n\nSince there are \\( p-1 \\) numbers in total and \\((p-1)/2\\) of them are quadratic residues, the remaining \\((p-1)/2\\) numbers must be quadratic nonresidues.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that exactly \\((p-1)/2\\) of the numbers \\( 1, 2, \\ldots, p-1 \\) are quadratic residues, and the other \\((p-1)/2\\) are quadratic nonresidues modulo \\( p \\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: \nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: \nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  DecidablePred fun x => \u2203 y, y ^ 2 = x\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  DecidablePred fun x => \u00ac\u2203 y, y ^ 2 = x\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\napplication type mismatch\n  Exists.intro residues\nargument\n  residues\nhas type\n  Finset \u2115 : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  Finset (ZMod p) : Type\napplication type mismatch\n  Exists.intro nonresidues\nargument\n  nonresidues\nhas type\n  Finset \u2115 : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  Finset (ZMod p) : Type\nunsolved goals\np : \u2115\nhp : p.Prime\nresidues : Finset \u2115 := Finset.filter (fun x => \u2203 y, y ^ 2 = x) (Finset.range p)\nnonresidues : Finset \u2115 := Finset.filter (fun x => \u00ac\u2203 y, y ^ 2 = x) (Finset.range p)\nh_residues : residues.card = (p - 1) / 2\nh_nonresidues : nonresidues.card = (p - 1) / 2\n\u22a2 1 = 0\nunsolved goals\np : \u2115\nhp : p.Prime\nresidues : Finset \u2115 := Finset.filter (fun x => \u2203 y, y ^ 2 = x) (Finset.range p)\nnonresidues : Finset \u2115 := Finset.filter (fun x => \u00ac\u2203 y, y ^ 2 = x) (Finset.range p)\nh_residues : residues.card = (p - 1) / 2\nh_nonresidues : nonresidues.card = (p - 1) / 2\n\u22a2 \u2200 (x : ZMod p), \u00acx ^ 2 = 0\nunsolved goals\ncase refine_2.refine_1\np : \u2115\nhp : p.Prime\nresidues : Finset \u2115 := Finset.filter (fun x => \u2203 y, y ^ 2 = x) (Finset.range p)\n\u22a2 DecidablePred fun x => \u00ac\u2203 y, y ^ 2 = x\n\ncase refine_1\np : \u2115\nhp : p.Prime\n\u22a2 DecidablePred fun x => \u2203 y, y ^ 2 = x\nPlease revise the proof.",

A cubic polynomial is irreducible over \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\) if it has no rational roots and cannot be factored into a product of a linear polynomial and a quadratic polynomial with rational coefficients.\n\nFirst, let's check for rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem. This theorem states that any rational root of the polynomial, expressed in the form \\( \\frac{p}{q} \\), must have \\( p \\) as a factor of the constant term (which is 2) and \\( q \\) as a factor of the leading coefficient (which is 1).

If such a factorization exists, it would be of the form \\( (x - r)(x^2 + ax + b) \\), where \\( r \\) is a rational root. However, since we have already established that there are no rational roots, this type of factorization is not possible.\n\nFinally, we can use Eisenstein's Criterion to further confirm irreducibility. However, in this case, the polynomial does not satisfy the conditions of Eisenstein's Criterion directly because the coefficients do not meet the divisibility requirements for any prime. Therefore, we rely on the absence of rational roots and the inability to factor into lower-degree polynomials with rational coefficients.\n\nSince \\( f(x) = x^3 + 3x + 2 \\) has no rational roots and cannot be factored into polynomials of lower degree with rational coefficients, it is irreducible over \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\).",

This means that adding the multiplicative identity \\(1\\) to itself \\(p\\) times results in \\(0\\). In other words, \\(p \\cdot 1 = 0\\) in the field. This property has a significant impact on the binomial theorem when applied in such fields.\n\nNow, consider the binomial expansion of \\((a + b)^m\\), where \\(m = p^n\\). According to the binomial theorem, we have:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^m = \\sum_{k=0}^{m} \\binom{m}{k} a^{m-k} b^k\n\\]\n\nIn a field of characteristic \\(p\\), the binomial coefficients \\(\\binom{m}{k}\\) have a special behavior. Specifically, if \\(m = p^n\\), then for any \\(1 \\leq k \\leq m-1\\), the binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{m}{k}\\) is divisible by \\(p\\). This is because the binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{m}{k}\\) can be expressed in terms of factorials, and when \\(m = p^n\\), the numerator of \\(\\binom{m}{k}\\) includes a factor of \\(p\\) that is not canceled out by the denominator unless \\(k = 0\\) or \\(k = m\\).\n\nSince the field has characteristic \\(p\\), any integer multiple of \\(p\\) is equivalent to \\(0\\) in the field. Therefore, for each \\(1 \\leq k \\leq m-1\\), the term \\(\\binom{m}{k} a^{m-k} b^k\\) becomes zero because \\(\\binom{m}{k}\\) is a multiple of \\(p\\).\n\nThus, the only non-zero terms in the expansion are those for \\(k = 0\\) and \\(k = m\\). These terms are:\n\n- For \\(k = 0\\): \\(\\binom{m}{0} a^m b^0 = a^m\\)\n- For \\(k = m\\): \\(\\binom{m}{m} a^0 b^m = b^m\\)\n\nTherefore, the entire binomial expansion simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^m = a^m + b^m\n\\]\n\nThis shows that in a field of characteristic \\(p\\), the expression \\((a + b)^m\\) simplifies to \\(a^m + b^m\\) when \\(m = p^n\\), due to the vanishing of all intermediate binomial coefficients.

The degree of the algebraic number is the degree of the minimal polynomial over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) that has the number as a root.\n\nIn this problem, we are given that \\( a \\) is a root of the polynomial \\( p(x) = x^5 + \\sqrt{2}x^3 + \\sqrt{5}x^2 + \\sqrt{7}x + \\sqrt{11} \\). This polynomial has coefficients that are not rational, but involve square roots of rational numbers. Specifically, the coefficients are \\(\\sqrt{2}\\), \\(\\sqrt{5}\\), \\(\\sqrt{7}\\), and \\(\\sqrt{11}\\).\n\nTo find a polynomial with rational coefficients that has \\( a \\) as a root, we need to eliminate the square roots from the coefficients. Each square root, such as \\(\\sqrt{2}\\), can be considered as a root of the polynomial \\( x^2 - 2 = 0 \\). Similarly, \\(\\sqrt{5}\\), \\(\\sqrt{7}\\), and \\(\\sqrt{11}\\) are roots of the polynomials \\( x^2 - 5 = 0 \\), \\( x^2 - 7 = 0 \\), and \\( x^2 - 11 = 0 \\), respectively.\n\nThe key idea is to construct a polynomial with rational coefficients that has the same roots as \\( p(x) \\). We can do this by considering the field extension \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{5}, \\sqrt{7}, \\sqrt{11})\\). The degree of this field extension over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) is determined by the number of independent square roots. Since each square root can be considered as a degree 2 extension, and assuming they are all independent (which they are, since none of the square roots can be expressed as a rational multiple of another), the degree of the extension is \\(2^4 = 16\\).\n\nNow, the polynomial \\( p(x) \\) is of degree 5. When we consider the polynomial over the field \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{5}, \\sqrt{7}, \\sqrt{11})\\), it remains a degree 5 polynomial. Therefore, the degree of the minimal polynomial of \\( a \\) over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) is at most the product of the degree of the field extension and the degree of the polynomial, which is \\(16 \\times 5 = 80\\).\n\nThus, \\( a \\) is algebraic over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) with a degree of at most 80.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

This means that in the field \\( F \\), adding the multiplicative identity \\( 1 \\) to itself \\( p \\) times results in \\( 0 \\). In other words, \\( p \\cdot 1 = 0 \\) in \\( F \\).\n\nNow, consider the polynomial \\( x^m - x \\) where \\( m = p^n \\). We want to find its roots and show that they are distinct. Notice that this polynomial can be rewritten as \\( x^m - x = x(x^{m-1} - 1) \\).\n\nThe roots of \\( x^m - x \\) are precisely the elements \\( a \\in F \\) such that \\( a^m = a \\). This can be rewritten as \\( a^m - a = 0 \\), which implies \\( a(a^{m-1} - 1) = 0 \\). Therefore, the roots are the solutions to \\( a^m = a \\).\n\nIn a field of characteristic \\( p \\), the Frobenius endomorphism, which maps each element \\( a \\) to \\( a^p \\), is a field homomorphism.

This set is actually a subfield of \\( F \\), known as the finite field \\( \\mathbb{F}_{p^n} \\), which contains exactly \\( p^n \\) elements. In this field, every element satisfies the equation \\( x^m = x \\).\n\nSince \\( \\mathbb{F}_{p^n} \\) is a field, it has no repeated elements, meaning each element is distinct. Therefore, the polynomial \\( x^m - x \\) has exactly \\( p^n \\) distinct roots, which are all the elements of \\( \\mathbb{F}_{p^n} \\).\n\nThus, we conclude that all the roots of the polynomial \\( x^m - x \\) are distinct, as they correspond to the distinct elements of the finite field \\( \\mathbb{F}_{p^n} \\).

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's recall what it means for a set \\( U \\) to be open in a metric space \\( M \\). A set \\( U \\) is open if, for every point \\( x \\) in \\( U \\), there exists some small \"bubble\" or neighborhood around \\( x \\) that is entirely contained within \\( U \\). This means that you can move a little bit in any direction from \\( x \\) and still remain inside \\( U \\).\n\nNow, let's consider the complement of \\( U \\), denoted as \\( M \\setminus U \\). This is simply the set of all points in \\( M \\) that are not in \\( U \\).\n\nThe problem asks us to show that \\( U \\) is open if and only if none of its points are limits of its complement. A point \\( x \\) is a limit point of a set \\( A \\) if every neighborhood around \\( x \\) contains at least one point from \\( A \\) that is different from \\( x \\).\n\n**(1) If \\( U \\) is open, then none of its points are limits of its complement:**\n\nAssume \\( U \\) is open. Take any point \\( x \\) in \\( U \\). By the definition of openness, there exists a neighborhood around \\( x \\) that is entirely contained within \\( U \\). This means that this neighborhood cannot contain any points from the complement \\( M \\setminus U \\). Therefore, \\( x \\) cannot be a limit point of \\( M \\setminus U \\) because there is a neighborhood around \\( x \\) that does not intersect \\( M \\setminus U \\) at all.\n\n**(2) If none of the points of \\( U \\) are limits of its complement, then \\( U \\) is open:**\n\nNow, assume that none of the points in \\( U \\) are limit points of \\( M \\setminus U \\). Take any point \\( x \\) in \\( U \\). Since \\( x \\) is not a limit point of \\( M \\setminus U \\), there must exist a neighborhood around \\( x \\) that does not contain any points from \\( M \\setminus U \\). This implies that this neighborhood is entirely contained within \\( U \\). Hence, by the definition of an open set, \\( U \\) must be open.\n\nIn summary, the openness of a set \\( U \\) is characterized by the fact that you can always find a neighborhood around any point in \\( U \\) that stays entirely within \\( U \\). This is equivalent to saying that no point in \\( U \\) can be a limit point of the complement \\( M \\setminus U \\), as such a limit point would imply that every neighborhood around it contains points from the complement, contradicting the openness of \\( U \\). Thus, we have shown the equivalence: \\( U \\) is open if and only if none of its points are limits of its complement.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown constant 'Filter.mem_closure_iff_clusterPt'\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, equality or iff proof expected\n  ?m.570\ncase mp\nM : Type u_1\ninst\u271d : TopologicalSpace M\nU : Set M\nhU : IsOpen U\nx : M\nhx : x \u2208 U\n\u22a2 \u00ac(\ud835\udcdd x \u2293 \ud835\udcdf U\u1d9c).NeBot\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  ?m.960 \u2208 \ud835\udcdd ?m.959\ncase mpr\nM : Type u_1\ninst\u271d : TopologicalSpace M\nU : Set M\nh : \u2200 x \u2208 U, \u00acClusterPt x (\ud835\udcdf U\u1d9c)\nx : M\nhx : x \u2208 U\n\u22a2 U \u2208 \ud835\udcdd x\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown constant 'Filter.mem_closure_iff_clusterPt'\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, equality or iff proof expected\n  ?m.570\ncase mp\nM : Type u_1\ninst\u271d : TopologicalSpace M\nU : Set M\nhU : IsOpen U\nx : M\nhx : x \u2208 U\n\u22a2 \u00ac(\ud835\udcdd x \u2293 \ud835\udcdf U\u1d9c).NeBot\nunknown constant 'Filter.mem_closure_iff_clusterPt'\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, equality or iff proof expected\n  ?m.1343\ncase mpr\nM : Type u_1\ninst\u271d : TopologicalSpace M\nU : Set M\nx : M\nhx : x \u2208 U\nh : \u00ac(\ud835\udcdd x \u2293 \ud835\udcdf U\u1d9c).NeBot\n\u22a2 U \u2208 \ud835\udcdd x\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to rewrite using equation theorems for 'ClusterPt'\ntype mismatch\n  h\nhas type\n  \u00ac\u2200 U_1 \u2208 \ud835\udcdd x, (U_1 \u2229 U\u1d9c).Nonempty : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  U \u2208 \ud835\udcdd x : Prop\nPlease revise the proof.",

Let's break down the reasoning step by step.\n\nFirst, let's recall some properties of compact sets. A set is compact if it is closed and bounded, and one of the key properties of compact sets in a metric space is that they are \"complete\" and \"totally bounded.\" This means that any sequence of points in a compact set has a subsequence that converges to a point within the set.\n\nNow, since \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are compact and disjoint, they are separated in the space \\( M \\). This separation implies that there is a positive minimum distance between the two sets because if the distance were zero, the sets would not be disjoint.\n\nTo find the minimum distance, consider the function \\( d(a, b) \\) which measures the distance between a point \\( a \\in A \\) and a point \\( b \\in B \\). This function is continuous because the distance function in a metric space is continuous. Since \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are compact, the product set \\( A \\times B \\) is also compact.

This means \\( K_1 \\supseteq K_2 \\supseteq K_3 \\supseteq \\ldots \\), and each \\( K_i \\) is a compact set.\n\nThe goal is to show that the intersection of all these sets, \\( \\bigcap_{i=1}^{\\infty} K_i \\), is nonempty.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Compactness and Finite Intersection Property**: Compact sets have a very useful property called the finite intersection property. This property states that if you have a collection of compact sets, and every finite subcollection of these sets has a nonempty intersection, then the intersection of all the sets in the collection is also nonempty.\n\n2. **Nested Sequence**: In our case, the sequence of sets \\( K_1, K_2, K_3, \\ldots \\) is nested, meaning each set contains the next. This automatically satisfies the finite intersection property because any finite number of these sets will have a nonempty intersection. For example, the intersection of \\( K_1, K_2, \\) and \\( K_3 \\) is simply \\( K_3 \\), which is nonempty by assumption.\n\n3. **Nonempty Intersection**: Since every finite intersection of these sets is nonempty, and because the sets are compact, the finite intersection property tells us that the intersection of all the sets \\( \\bigcap_{i=1}^{\\infty} K_i \\) must also be nonempty.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the nested decreasing intersection of these nonempty covering compact sets is nonempty. The compactness of the sets and the nested nature of the sequence ensure that there is at least one point common to all sets in the sequence.\n\nThis reasoning shows that the intersection of an infinite sequence of nested, nonempty, compact sets is nonempty, leveraging the compactness and the finite intersection property.\nPrevious attempt failed with: type mismatch\n  hs 0\nhas type\n  s 0 \u2283 s (0 + 1) : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  (\u22c2 i, \u22c2 (_ : i \u2264 0), s i).Nonempty : Prop\nunsolved goals\ncase h\n\u03b1 : Type u_1\ninst\u271d : TopologicalSpace \u03b1\ns : \u2115 \u2192 Set \u03b1\nhs\u271d\u00b9 : \u2200 (i : \u2115), IsCompact (s i)\nhs\u271d : \u2200 (i : \u2115), (s i).Nonempty\nhs : \u2200 (i : \u2115), s i \u2283 s (i + 1)\nn : \u2115\nih : (\u22c2 i, \u22c2 (_ : i \u2264 n), s i).Nonempty\nx : \u03b1\n\u22a2 (\u2200 i \u2264 n + 1, x \u2208 s i) \u2194 (\u2200 i \u2264 n, x \u2208 s i) \u2227 x \u2208 s (n + 1)\nfunction expected at\n  Set.inter_subset_right ?m.30792\nterm has type\n  ?m.30791 \u2208 ?m.30790\nunknown constant 'Set.nonempty_iInter_of_nonempty_biInter'\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: type mismatch\n  hs 0\nhas type\n  s 0 \u2283 s (0 + 1) : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  (\u22c2 i, \u22c2 (_ : i \u2264 0), s i).Nonempty : Prop\napplication type mismatch\n  le_trans hi (Nat.le_succ (n + 1))\nargument\n  Nat.le_succ (n + 1)\nhas type\n  n + 1 \u2264 (n + 1).succ : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  n + 1 \u2264 n : Prop\nunknown constant 'Set.nonempty_iInter_of_nonempty_biInter'\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: type mismatch\n  hs 0\nhas type\n  s 0 \u2283 s (0 + 1) : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  (\u22c2 i, \u22c2 (_ : i \u2264 0), s i).Nonempty : Prop\napplication type mismatch\n  le_trans hi (Nat.le_succ (n + 1))\nargument\n  Nat.le_succ (n + 1)\nhas type\n  n + 1 \u2264 (n + 1).succ : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  n + 1 \u2264 n : Prop\nunknown constant 'Set.nonempty_iInter_of_nonempty_biInter'\nPlease revise the proof.",

The center of a group, say \\( G \\), is the set of elements in \\( G \\) that commute with every element of \\( G \\). In other words, the center of \\( G \\), denoted as \\( Z(G) \\), is the set of all elements \\( g \\in G \\) such that for every \\( x \\in G \\), the equation \\( gx = xg \\) holds.\n\nNow, when we talk about the product of two groups, \\( G \\times H \\), we are considering the set of all ordered pairs \\( (g, h) \\) where \\( g \\in G \\) and \\( h \\in H \\). The group operation in \\( G \\times H \\) is defined component-wise, meaning \\( (g_1, h_1) \\cdot (g_2, h_2) = (g_1g_2, h_1h_2) \\).\n\nThe center of the product group \\( G \\times H \\), denoted \\( Z(G \\times H) \\), consists of all elements \\( (g, h) \\) in \\( G \\times H \\) that commute with every other element \\( (g', h') \\) in \\( G \\times H \\). This means for every \\( (g', h') \\), we have:\n\n\\[\n(g, h) \\cdot (g', h') = (g', h') \\cdot (g, h)\n\\]\n\nExpanding this using the group operation, we get:\n\n\\[\n(g g', h h') = (g' g, h' h)\n\\]\n\nFor this equality to hold for all \\( g' \\in G \\) and \\( h' \\in H \\), it must be that \\( g g' = g' g \\) for all \\( g' \\) and \\( h h' = h' h \\) for all \\( h' \\). This means \\( g \\) must be in the center of \\( G \\), \\( Z(G) \\), and \\( h \\) must be in the center of \\( H \\), \\( Z(H) \\).\n\nTherefore, the center of the product group \\( G \\times H \\) is precisely the set of pairs \\( (g, h) \\) where \\( g \\in Z(G) \\) and \\( h \\in Z(H) \\). This is exactly the product of the centers of \\( G \\) and \\( H \\), denoted \\( Z(G) \\times Z(H) \\).\n\nIn summary, the center of the product group \\( G \\times H \\) is the product of the centers of \\( G \\) and \\( H \\) because an element in the center of the product must commute with all elements in both groups, which is only possible if each component of the element is in the center of its respective group.\nPrevious attempt failed with: function expected at\n  z.property\nterm has type\n  \u2191z \u2208 center (G \u00d7 H)\nfunction expected at\n  z.property\nterm has type\n  \u2191z \u2208 center (G \u00d7 H)\napplication type mismatch\n  \u27e8(\u2191p.1, \u2191p.2), fun g h => ?m.1839 g h\u27e9\nargument\n  fun g h => ?m.1839 g h\nhas type\n  (g : ?m.1829) \u2192 (h : ?m.1837 g) \u2192 ?m.1838 g h : Sort (imax ?u.1828 ?u.1831 ?u.1834)\nbut is expected to have type\n  (\u2191p.1, \u2191p.2) \u2208 center (G \u00d7 H) : Prop\ninvalid constructor \u27e8...\u27e9, expected type must be an inductive type \n  ?m.1838 g h\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  \u27e8(\u2191z).1, (\u2191z).2\u27e9\nargument\n  (\u2191z).2\nhas type\n  H : Type u_2\nbut is expected to have type\n  (\u2191z).1 \u2208 center G : Prop\napplication type mismatch\n  Subtype.mk \u22ef\nargument\n  z.property.comm\nhas type\n  \u2200 (a : G \u00d7 H), \u2191z * a = a * \u2191z : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  H : Type u_2\ninvalid constructor \u27e8...\u27e9, insufficient number of arguments, constructs 'IsMulCentral.mk' has #4 explicit fields, but only #2 provided\nunsolved goals\ncase a.a\nG : Type u_1\nH : Type u_2\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : Group G\ninst\u271d : Group H\nz : \u21a5(center (G \u00d7 H))\n\u22a2 sorryAx H true = (\u2191z).2\nunsolved goals\ncase a.a\nG : Type u_1\nH : Type u_2\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : Group G\ninst\u271d : Group H\np : \u21a5(center G) \u00d7 \u21a5(center H)\n\u22a2 sorryAx H true = \u2191p.2\nunsolved goals\ncase a.a\nG : Type u_1\nH : Type u_2\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : Group G\ninst\u271d : Group H\nz1 z2 : \u21a5(center (G \u00d7 H))\n\u22a2 sorryAx H true = 1\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  \u27e8(\u2191z).1, (\u2191z).2\u27e9\nargument\n  (\u2191z).2\nhas type\n  H : Type u_2\nbut is expected to have type\n  (\u2191z).1 \u2208 center G : Prop\napplication type mismatch\n  Subtype.mk \u22ef\nargument\n  z.property.comm\nhas type\n  \u2200 (a : G \u00d7 H), \u2191z * a = a * \u2191z : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  H : Type u_2\ninvalid constructor \u27e8...\u27e9, insufficient number of arguments, constructs 'IsMulCentral.mk' has #4 explicit fields, but only #2 provided\nunsolved goals\ncase a.a\nG : Type u_1\nH : Type u_2\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : Group G\ninst\u271d : Group H\nz : \u21a5(center (G \u00d7 H))\n\u22a2 sorryAx H true = (\u2191z).2\nunsolved goals\ncase a.a\nG : Type u_1\nH : Type u_2\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : Group G\ninst\u271d : Group H\np : \u21a5(center G) \u00d7 \u21a5(center H)\n\u22a2 sorryAx H true = \u2191p.2\nunsolved goals\ncase a.a\nG : Type u_1\nH : Type u_2\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : Group G\ninst\u271d : Group H\nz1 z2 : \u21a5(center (G \u00d7 H))\n\u22a2 sorryAx H true = 1\nPlease revise the proof.",

A field is a set equipped with two operations, addition and multiplication, satisfying certain properties like the existence of additive and multiplicative identities (0 and 1, respectively), and every non-zero element having a multiplicative inverse. A homomorphism between two fields is a function that respects these operations, meaning it preserves addition and multiplication.\n\nNow, let's consider a homomorphism \\( f: F \\to K \\) between two fields \\( F \\) and \\( K \\). To show that \\( f \\) is injective, we need to demonstrate that if \\( f(a) = f(b) \\) for some elements \\( a, b \\in F \\), then \\( a = b \\).\n\nFirst, observe that the kernel of a homomorphism, which is the set of elements in \\( F \\) that map to the additive identity (0) in \\( K \\), plays a crucial role. Specifically, the kernel of a field homomorphism is an ideal of \\( F \\). However, in a field, the only ideals are the trivial ones: the zero ideal \\(\\{0\\}\\) and the entire field itself. \n\nIf the kernel were the entire field \\( F \\), then every element of \\( F \\) would map to 0 in \\( K \\), which would mean that the homomorphism is the zero map. But this cannot be the case for a homomorphism of fields because it must map the multiplicative identity 1 in \\( F \\) to the multiplicative identity 1 in \\( K \\). Therefore, the kernel cannot be the entire field.\n\nThus, the only possibility left is that the kernel is the zero ideal \\(\\{0\\}\\). This means that the only element of \\( F \\) that maps to 0 in \\( K \\) is 0 itself. Consequently, if \\( f(a) = f(b) \\), then \\( f(a - b) = f(a) - f(b) = 0 \\). Since the kernel is \\(\\{0\\}\\), it follows that \\( a - b = 0 \\), which implies \\( a = b \\).\n\nTherefore, the homomorphism \\( f \\) is injective, as it maps distinct elements of \\( F \\) to distinct elements of \\( K \\). This reasoning shows that every homomorphism of fields is indeed injective.\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  RingHom.injective \u03c6 this\nargument\n  this\nhas type\n  \u03c6 (a - b) = 0 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u03c6 (a - b) = \u03c6 ?m.17224 : Prop\ntype mismatch\n  h\u271d\nhas type\n  a - b = 0 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  a = b : Prop\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: type mismatch\n  h\u271d\nhas type\n  \u03c6 a - \u03c6 b = 0 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  a - b = 0 : Prop\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  (fun x => \u03c6 x) (\u03c6 (a - b))\nargument\n  \u03c6 (a - b)\nhas type\n  G : Type u_2\nbut is expected to have type\n  F : Type u_1\nPlease revise the proof.",

A proper subspace of \\( V \\) is a subspace that is strictly smaller than \\( V \\) itself, meaning it does not contain all the vectors in \\( V \\).\n\nNow, let's assume for contradiction that \\( V \\) can be expressed as the union of finitely many proper subspaces, say \\( V = W_1 \\cup W_2 \\cup \\cdots \\cup W_n \\), where each \\( W_i \\) is a proper subspace of \\( V \\).\n\nSince each \\( W_i \\) is a proper subspace, it has a smaller dimension than \\( V \\). This means that for each \\( W_i \\), there exists at least one vector in \\( V \\) that is not in \\( W_i \\). However, if we consider the union of all these subspaces, we are claiming that every vector in \\( V \\) is contained in at least one of these subspaces.\n\nHere's where the infinite nature of the field \\( F \\) plays a crucial role. In an infinite field, we can always find a vector in \\( V \\) that is not in the span of any finite set of vectors from \\( V \\). This is because, in an infinite field, we can scale vectors by infinitely many different scalars, creating infinitely many distinct vectors.\n\nLet's consider a basis for \\( V \\). If \\( V \\) is finite-dimensional, say with dimension \\( d \\), then any proper subspace \\( W_i \\) has dimension less than \\( d \\). The union of finitely many subspaces of dimension less than \\( d \\) cannot cover all of \\( V \\) because we can always find a vector that is not in the span of any combination of vectors from these subspaces. Specifically, we can choose a vector that is a linear combination involving a new scalar from the infinite field that hasn't been used in any of the subspaces.\n\nIf \\( V \\) is infinite-dimensional, the argument is even stronger. Each proper subspace is still of lower dimension than \\( V \\), and the infinite nature of the field allows us to construct vectors that are outside any finite union of these lower-dimensional subspaces.\n\nThus, in both finite and infinite-dimensional cases, the assumption that \\( V \\) is the union of finitely many proper subspaces leads to a contradiction.

A group is simple if it has no nontrivial normal subgroups, meaning the only normal subgroups it has are the trivial group and the group itself.\n\nThe order of a group is the number of elements in the group. In this case, the order is 224. We can factor 224 into prime factors: \\(224 = 2^5 \\times 7\\). According to Sylow's theorems, which are powerful tools in group theory, we can determine the number of subgroups of a given prime order in a group.\n\nSylow's theorems tell us that for a group of order \\(p^n \\times m\\), where \\(p\\) is a prime and \\(m\\) is not divisible by \\(p\\), the number of subgroups of order \\(p^n\\) (called Sylow \\(p\\)-subgroups) is congruent to 1 modulo \\(p\\) and also divides the order of the group.\n\nLet's apply this to our group of order 224:\n\n1. **Sylow 2-subgroups**: The number of Sylow 2-subgroups must divide 224 and be congruent to 1 modulo 2. The divisors of 224 are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 56, 112, and 224. The numbers that are congruent to 1 modulo 2 are 1, 3, 5, 7, etc., but only 1, 7, and 35 are divisors of 224. Therefore, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups could be 1 or 7.\n\n2. **Sylow 7-subgroups**: The number of Sylow 7-subgroups must divide 224 and be congruent to 1 modulo 7. The divisors of 224 that satisfy this are 1 and 32 (since 32 is congruent to 1 modulo 7).\n\nNow, let's consider the implications:\n\n- If there is only 1 Sylow 2-subgroup, it must be normal because any subgroup that is the only one of its kind is normal.\n- If there is only 1 Sylow 7-subgroup, it must also be normal for the same reason.\n\nFor the group to be simple, it cannot have any nontrivial normal subgroups. However, if either the number of Sylow 2-subgroups is 1 or the number of Sylow 7-subgroups is 1, then the group has a nontrivial normal subgroup, contradicting the simplicity of the group.\n\nTherefore, the only way for the group to avoid having a normal Sylow subgroup is if there are 7 Sylow 2-subgroups and 32 Sylow 7-subgroups. However, this configuration is impossible because the total number of elements in these subgroups would exceed the order of the group, or they would overlap in a way that forces a normal subgroup to exist.\n\nThus, we conclude that no group of order 224 can be simple, as it must have a nontrivial normal subgroup due to the constraints imposed by Sylow's theorems.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown constant 'Subgroup.normal'\nunknown constant 'Sylow.nonempty_normal_of_card_prime_dvd'\nunknown constant 'Subgroup.normal'\nunknown constant 'Sylow.nonempty_normal_of_card_prime_dvd'\ninvalid field 'normal', the environment does not contain 'Subgroup.normal'\n  N\nhas type\n  Subgroup G\nunknown constant 'Subgroup.bot_eq_one'\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, equality or iff proof expected\n  ?m.576\ncase h.left\nG : Type u_1\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : Group G\ninst\u271d : Fintype G\nhG : card G = 224\nh_simple : IsSimpleGroup G\nP2 : Sylow 2 G\nhP2 : sorryAx Prop true\nP7 : Sylow 7 G\nhP7 : sorryAx Prop true\nh : \u2191P2 = \u22a5\n\u22a2 False\ninvalid field 'exists_normal_subgroup_of_nontrivial', the environment does not contain 'IsSimpleGroup.exists_normal_subgroup_of_nontrivial'\n  h_simple\nhas type\n  IsSimpleGroup G\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown constant 'Subgroup.normal'\nunknown constant 'Sylow.exists_normal_of_card_prime_dvd'\nunknown constant 'Subgroup.normal'\nunknown constant 'Sylow.exists_normal_of_card_prime_dvd'\nfailed to synthesize\n  Bot (Sylow 2 G)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nunknown constant 'Sylow.ne_bot_of_prime_dvd'\nfailed to synthesize\n  Bot (Sylow 7 G)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nunknown constant 'Sylow.ne_bot_of_prime_dvd'\nfailed to synthesize\n  Bot (Sylow 2 G)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  Bot (Sylow 7 G)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\ninvalid field 'exists_normal_subgroup_of_nontrivial', the environment does not contain 'IsSimpleGroup.exists_normal_subgroup_of_nontrivial'\n  h_simple\nhas type\n  IsSimpleGroup G\nunknown identifier 'h8'\ntactic 'induction' failed, major premise type is not an inductive type \n  ?m.5926\ncase intro.intro.refine_1\nG : Type u_1\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : Group G\ninst\u271d : Fintype G\nhG : card G = 224\nh_simple : IsSimpleGroup G\nh1 : Nat.Prime 2\nh2 : Nat.Prime 7\nh3 : 224 = 2 ^ 5 * 7\nP2 : Sylow 2 G\nhP2 : sorryAx Prop true\nP7 : Sylow 7 G\nhP7 : sorryAx Prop true\nh6 : P2 \u2260 sorryAx (Sylow 2 G) true\nh7 : P7 \u2260 sorryAx (Sylow 7 G) true\nx\u271d : ?m.5926\n\u22a2 Bot (Sylow 2 G)\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  @Sylow.exists_subgroup_card_pow_prime ?m.1648 ?m.1649 ?m.1650 h1\nargument\n  h1\nhas type\n  Nat.Prime 2 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u2115 : Type\napplication type mismatch\n  @Sylow.exists_subgroup_card_pow_prime ?m.5420 ?m.5421 ?m.5422 h2\nargument\n  h2\nhas type\n  Nat.Prime 7 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u2115 : Type\ninvalid field 'normal', the environment does not contain 'Subgroup.normal'\n  \u2191P2\nhas type\n  Subgroup G\nunknown constant 'Sylow.normal_of_all_max_p_subgroups_normal'\ninvalid field 'normal', the environment does not contain 'Subgroup.normal'\n  \u2191P7\nhas type\n  Subgroup G\nunknown constant 'Sylow.normal_of_all_max_p_subgroups_normal'\nfunction expected at\n  IsSimpleGroup.toNontrivial\nterm has type\n  Nontrivial G\nPlease revise the proof.",

The Gaussian integers are complex numbers of the form \\( a + bi \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are integers, and \\( i \\) is the imaginary unit with the property \\( i^2 = -1 \\).\n\nAn ideal in the ring of Gaussian integers is a subset of Gaussian integers that is closed under addition and under multiplication by any Gaussian integer. Our goal is to show that if we have a nonzero ideal in this ring, it must contain a nonzero integer (a Gaussian integer with zero imaginary part).\n\nLet's consider a nonzero ideal \\( I \\) in the ring of Gaussian integers. Since \\( I \\) is nonzero, it contains at least one nonzero Gaussian integer, say \\( z = a + bi \\), where at least one of \\( a \\) or \\( b \\) is nonzero.\n\nTo find a nonzero integer in \\( I \\), we can use the concept of the norm of a Gaussian integer. The norm of a Gaussian integer \\( z = a + bi \\) is defined as \\( N(z) = a^2 + b^2 \\). The norm has the useful property that it is a non-negative integer and, importantly, it is multiplicative: \\( N(zw) = N(z)N(w) \\) for any Gaussian integers \\( z \\) and \\( w \\).\n\nSince \\( z \\) is in the ideal \\( I \\), and \\( I \\) is closed under multiplication by any Gaussian integer, we can multiply \\( z \\) by its complex conjugate \\( \\overline{z} = a - bi \\).

Multiplying both sides of this equation by \\( z \\), we get:\n\n\\[ z = z \\cdot 1 = z(a + b) = za + zb. \\]\n\nHere, \\( za \\in I \\) because \\( z \\in I \\) and \\( a \\in I \\), and \\( zb \\in J \\) because \\( z \\in J \\) and \\( b \\in J \\). Therefore, \\( za \\in IJ \\) and \\( zb \\in IJ \\) because \\( IJ \\) is an ideal and closed under addition.

In other words, we need to check if there exists some \\(a \\in \\mathbb{F}_{31}\\) such that \\(a^3 \\equiv 9 \\pmod{31}\\).\n\nTo do this, we can compute \\(a^3 \\mod 31\\) for each \\(a\\) from 0 to 30 and see if any of these are congruent to 9. However, instead of checking each one manually, we can use the fact that \\(\\mathbb{F}_{31}\\) is a field with 31 elements, and the non-zero elements form a cyclic group under multiplication. This means every non-zero element is a power of some generator \\(g\\).\n\nLet's assume \\(g\\) is a generator of the multiplicative group of \\(\\mathbb{F}_{31}\\). Then every non-zero element \\(a\\) can be written as \\(g^k\\) for some \\(k\\).

If 9 is a cubic residue, there exists some \\(k\\) such that \\(g^{3k} \\equiv 9\\). However, if we compute the powers of 9 modulo 31, we find that 9 is not a cubic residue. This is because the order of the multiplicative group \\(\\mathbb{F}_{31}^*\\) is 30, and the number of cubic residues is given by \\(\\frac{30}{3} = 10\\). By checking the powers, we find that 9 is not among these residues.\n\nSince 9 is not a cubic residue, \\(x^3 - 9\\) has no roots in \\(\\mathbb{F}_{31}\\), meaning it cannot be factored into a product of a linear polynomial and a quadratic polynomial.\n\nNext, we consider the possibility of \\(x^3 - 9\\) being factored into a product of three linear polynomials or a linear and an irreducible quadratic polynomial.

A prime \\(p\\) is congruent to \\(-1\\) modulo \\(4\\) if when you divide \\(p\\) by \\(4\\), the remainder is \\(3\\) (since \\(-1\\) is equivalent to \\(3\\) in modulo \\(4\\) arithmetic). So, we are looking for primes of the form \\(4k + 3\\).\n\nAssume, for the sake of contradiction, that there are only finitely many such primes. Let's list them as \\(p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n\\). We will construct a number that will lead us to a contradiction.\n\nConsider the number \\(N = 4(p_1p_2\\cdots p_n) - 1\\). Notice that \\(N\\) is clearly an odd number because it is one less than a multiple of \\(4\\). Also, \\(N\\) is not divisible by any of the primes \\(p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n\\) because if you divide \\(N\\) by any \\(p_i\\), you get a remainder of \\(-1\\), which is not zero. This means \\(N\\) is not divisible by any of the primes we assumed to be the only primes congruent to \\(-1\\) modulo \\(4\\).\n\nNow, \\(N\\) must have a prime factor, since every integer greater than \\(1\\) has at least one prime factor. Let \\(q\\) be a prime factor of \\(N\\). Since \\(N\\) is of the form \\(4k + 3\\) (because \\(4(p_1p_2\\cdots p_n)\\) is of the form \\(4k\\) and subtracting \\(1\\) gives \\(4k + 3\\)), any prime factor \\(q\\) of \\(N\\) must also be of the form \\(4m + 3\\). This is because if a number of the form \\(4k + 3\\) is divisible by a prime of the form \\(4m + 1\\), the quotient would not be an integer of the form \\(4n + 3\\), which contradicts the form of \\(N\\).\n\nTherefore, \\(q\\) must be a prime of the form \\(4m + 3\\), and since \\(q\\) divides \\(N\\), it cannot be any of the primes \\(p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n\\). This means \\(q\\) is a new prime congruent to \\(-1\\) modulo \\(4\\), which contradicts our assumption that we had listed all such primes.\n\nThus, our assumption that there are only finitely many primes congruent to \\(-1\\) modulo \\(4\\) must be false.

The operation \\(av\\) represents scalar multiplication, where \\(a\\) is a scalar from \\(\\mathbf{F}\\) and \\(v\\) is a vector from \\(V\\).\n\nThe problem states that if the result of this scalar multiplication, \\(av\\), is the zero vector (denoted as \\(0\\)), then either the scalar \\(a\\) must be zero or the vector \\(v\\) must be the zero vector.\n\nLet's break down why this is true:\n\n1. **Understanding Scalar Multiplication**: In a vector space, scalar multiplication has certain properties. One key property is that multiplying any vector by the scalar zero results in the zero vector. That is, for any vector \\(v\\), \\(0 \\cdot v = 0\\).\n\n2. **Case 1: \\(a = 0\\)**: If \\(a\\) is zero, then regardless of what \\(v\\) is, the product \\(av\\) will be zero because \\(0 \\cdot v = 0\\).

A subspace of a vector space \\( V \\) must satisfy three conditions: it must contain the zero vector, it must be closed under vector addition, and it must be closed under scalar multiplication.\n\nNow, consider two subspaces \\( U \\) and \\( W \\) of \\( V \\). The union of these two subspaces, denoted \\( U \\cup W \\), is the set of all vectors that are in either \\( U \\) or \\( W \\) (or both).\n\n**Forward Direction:**\n\nAssume that the union \\( U \\cup W \\) is a subspace of \\( V \\). We need to show that one of the subspaces is contained in the other, i.e., either \\( U \\subseteq W \\) or \\( W \\subseteq U \\).\n\nSince \\( U \\cup W \\) is a subspace, it must be closed under vector addition. Take any vector \\( u \\in U \\) and any vector \\( w \\in W \\). Both \\( u \\) and \\( w \\) are in \\( U \\cup W \\) because \\( u \\in U \\) and \\( w \\in W \\). Therefore, their sum \\( u + w \\) must also be in \\( U \\cup W \\).\n\nNow, consider the possibilities for \\( u + w \\):\n- If \\( u + w \\in U \\), then since \\( u \\in U \\), it follows that \\( w = (u + w) - u \\) must also be in \\( U \\) (because subspaces are closed under subtraction, which is a consequence of being closed under addition and scalar multiplication).\n- Similarly, if \\( u + w \\in W \\), then since \\( w \\in W \\), it follows that \\( u = (u + w) - w \\) must also be in \\( W \\).\n\nThus, for any \\( u \\in U \\) and \\( w \\in W \\), either \\( w \\in U \\) or \\( u \\in W \\). This implies that all elements of one subspace must be in the other, meaning \\( U \\subseteq W \\) or \\( W \\subseteq U \\).\n\n**Backward Direction:**\n\nNow, assume that one of the subspaces is contained in the other, say \\( U \\subseteq W \\). We need to show that \\( U \\cup W \\) is a subspace of \\( V \\).\n\nSince \\( U \\subseteq W \\), every element of \\( U \\) is also in \\( W \\). Therefore, \\( U \\cup W = W \\). Since \\( W \\) is already a subspace of \\( V \\), \\( U \\cup W \\) is trivially a subspace.\n\nThe same argument holds if \\( W \\subseteq U \\), in which case \\( U \\cup W = U \\), and \\( U \\) is a subspace of \\( V \\).\n\nIn conclusion, the union of two subspaces \\( U \\) and \\( W \\) is a subspace of \\( V \\) if and only if one of the subspaces is contained within the other. This is because only in such cases does the union satisfy the necessary conditions of being closed under addition and scalar multiplication.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

Let's denote this basis by \\(\\{v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_n\\}\\).\n\n3. **Decomposing the Space**:\n   - We can decompose \\( V \\) into two complementary subspaces: the null space of \\( T \\) and another subspace that complements it. Let's denote the null space by \\( N \\) and the complementary subspace by \\( U \\).\n   - The key property of \\( U \\) is that it should not intersect with \\( N \\) except at the zero vector, i.e., \\( U \\cap N = \\{0\\} \\).\n\n4. **Constructing the Subspace \\( U \\)**:\n   - To construct \\( U \\), we can extend a basis of \\( N \\) to a basis of \\( V \\). Suppose \\(\\{v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_k\\}\\) is a basis for \\( N \\).\n   - Extend this to a basis for \\( V \\) by adding vectors \\(\\{v_{k+1}, \\ldots, v_n\\}\\) such that \\(\\{v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_k, v_{k+1}, \\ldots, v_n\\}\\) is a basis for \\( V \\).\n   - Define \\( U \\) to be the span of \\(\\{v_{k+1}, \\ldots, v_n\\}\\). By construction, \\( U \\cap N = \\{0\\}\\).\n\n5. **Verifying the Range Condition**:\n   - Now, consider the image of \\( U \\) under \\( T \\). Since \\( U \\) is spanned by \\(\\{v_{k+1}, \\ldots, v_n\\}\\), the set \\(\\{T(v_{k+1}), \\ldots, T(v_n)\\}\\) spans the image of \\( U \\).\n   - Because \\( U \\) complements \\( N \\), the vectors \\(\\{T(v_{k+1}), \\ldots, T(v_n)\\}\\) span the entire range of \\( T \\). This is because any vector in the range of \\( T \\) can be expressed as a linear combination of these images.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - We have found a subspace \\( U \\) such that \\( U \\cap \\operatorname{null} T = \\{0\\} \\) and the range of \\( T \\) is exactly the set of all images of elements from \\( U \\) under \\( T \\).\n   - Therefore, the subspace \\( U \\) satisfies both required conditions, completing the proof.\n\nIn summary, by carefully choosing a complementary subspace to the null space of \\( T \\), we can ensure that the range of \\( T \\) is captured entirely by the images of vectors from this subspace, while also maintaining the intersection condition with the null space.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'let'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'let'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'let'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

We want to show that the sum of these subspaces, denoted \\( U_1 + U_2 + \\cdots + U_m \\), is also invariant under \\( T \\).\n\nThe sum \\( U_1 + U_2 + \\cdots + U_m \\) consists of all vectors that can be written as a sum of vectors, where each vector comes from one of the subspaces \\( U_i \\).

For a transformation \\(A\\), \\(\\lambda\\) is an eigenvalue if there exists a non-zero vector \\(v\\) such that \\(Av = \\lambda v\\).

This means that for every vector \\( v \\) in \\( V \\), \\( T(v) = \\lambda v \\) for some scalar \\( \\lambda \\).\n\nLet's start by considering the condition given: every subspace of \\( V \\) with dimension \\( \\operatorname{dim} V - 1 \\) is invariant under \\( T \\). This means that if you take any such subspace \\( W \\), then for any vector \\( w \\) in \\( W \\), \\( T(w) \\) is also in \\( W \\).\n\nNow, let's think about what this implies. If \\( V \\) has dimension \\( n \\), then any subspace of dimension \\( n-1 \\) is essentially a hyperplane in \\( V \\). A hyperplane can be thought of as the set of all vectors orthogonal to some fixed vector, or equivalently, the kernel of a linear functional. \n\nConsider any vector \\( v \\) in \\( V \\). We can construct a subspace \\( W \\) of dimension \\( n-1 \\) that contains all vectors orthogonal to \\( v \\). Since \\( W \\) is invariant under \\( T \\), \\( T \\) must map any vector in \\( W \\) back into \\( W \\).\n\nNow, let's consider what happens to \\( v \\) itself. Since \\( v \\) is not in \\( W \\) (unless \\( v = 0 \\)), \\( T(v) \\) could potentially have a component outside of \\( W \\). However, if \\( T \\) were not a scalar multiple of the identity, we could find some vector \\( v \\) such that \\( T(v) \\) is not a scalar multiple of \\( v \\), which would mean that \\( T(v) \\) has a component outside of every hyperplane that contains \\( v \\). This would contradict the invariance of these hyperplanes under \\( T \\).\n\nTo make this more concrete, suppose \\( T(v) = \\lambda v + u \\) where \\( u \\) is not a scalar multiple of \\( v \\). Then, for any hyperplane \\( W \\) containing \\( v \\), \\( u \\) would have to lie in \\( W \\) because \\( T \\) maps \\( W \\) into itself.

An eigenvalue of \\( T \\) would be a scalar \\( \\lambda \\) such that there exists a non-zero vector \\( v \\in V \\) with \\( T(v) = \\lambda v \\). If \\( T \\) has no eigenvalues, it means there is no such scalar \\( \\lambda \\) and vector \\( v \\) that satisfy this condition.

This means that if you take any vector \\( w \\) in \\( W \\), then \\( T(w) \\) is also in \\( W \\). We need to show that the dimension of \\( W \\) is even.\n\nSince \\( T \\) has no eigenvalues, it suggests that \\( T \\) behaves in a way that is more complex than simple scaling by a real number. A common scenario in linear algebra where an operator has no real eigenvalues is when the operator is similar to a rotation or involves complex numbers. In real vector spaces, such operators often have complex eigenvalues, which come in conjugate pairs. However, since we are working in a real vector space, these complex eigenvalues do not manifest as real eigenvalues.\n\nThe key insight here is to consider the minimal polynomial of \\( T \\). Since \\( T \\) has no real eigenvalues, its minimal polynomial must be a product of irreducible quadratic polynomials over the reals. Each irreducible quadratic polynomial corresponds to a pair of complex conjugate eigenvalues. \n\nWhen we restrict \\( T \\) to an invariant subspace \\( W \\), the minimal polynomial of \\( T \\) restricted to \\( W \\) must also be a product of irreducible quadratics. This is because if \\( W \\) had an odd-dimensional component, it would imply the existence of a real eigenvalue, contradicting the fact that \\( T \\) has no eigenvalues.\n\nTherefore, the dimension of \\( W \\) must be even. This is because each irreducible quadratic polynomial contributes a factor of 2 to the dimension of the space on which it acts. Since the entire space \\( V \\) and any invariant subspace \\( W \\) can be decomposed into these 2-dimensional blocks (corresponding to the complex conjugate pairs), the dimension of \\( W \\) must be a sum of even numbers, hence even.\n\nIn conclusion, the absence of real eigenvalues for \\( T \\) forces any invariant subspace to be composed of these 2-dimensional blocks, ensuring that every invariant subspace of \\( V \\) has an even dimension.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

This implies that \\(\\langle e_i, e_j \\rangle = 0\\) for \\(i \\neq j\\) and \\(\\langle e_i, e_i \\rangle = 1\\).\n\n2. **Expressing \\( v \\) in terms of the orthonormal basis**: If \\( v \\) is in the span of \\((e_1, \\ldots, e_m)\\), it can be written as a linear combination of these vectors: \\( v = a_1 e_1 + a_2 e_2 + \\cdots + a_m e_m \\) for some scalars \\( a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_m \\).\n\n3. **Calculating the norm of \\( v \\)**: The norm squared of \\( v \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\|v\\|^2 = \\langle v, v \\rangle = \\langle a_1 e_1 + a_2 e_2 + \\cdots + a_m e_m, a_1 e_1 + a_2 e_2 + \\cdots + a_m e_m \\rangle\n   \\]\n   Using the properties of inner products and orthonormality, this expands to:\n   \\[\n   \\|v\\|^2 = a_1^2 \\langle e_1, e_1 \\rangle + a_2^2 \\langle e_2, e_2 \\rangle + \\cdots + a_m^2 \\langle e_m, e_m \\rangle = a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \\cdots + a_m^2\n   \\]\n\n4. **Relating to inner products**: The inner product \\(\\langle v, e_i \\rangle\\) is simply \\( a_i \\) because:\n   \\[\n   \\langle v, e_i \\rangle = \\langle a_1 e_1 + a_2 e_2 + \\cdots + a_m e_m, e_i \\rangle = a_i \\langle e_i, e_i \\rangle = a_i\n   \\]\n   Therefore, \\(|\\langle v, e_i \\rangle|^2 = a_i^2\\).\n\n5. **Summing the squares of the inner products**: The sum of the squares of these inner products is:\n   \\[\n   |\\langle v, e_1 \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle v, e_2 \\rangle|^2 + \\cdots + |\\langle v, e_m \\rangle|^2 = a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \\cdots + a_m^2\n   \\]\n   This matches exactly with \\(\\|v\\|^2\\).\n\n6. **Conclusion for the \"if\" part**: If \\( v \\) is in the span of \\((e_1, \\ldots, e_m)\\), then \\(\\|v\\|^2\\) equals the sum of the squares of the inner products, as shown above.\n\n7. **Conclusion for the \"only if\" part**: Conversely, if \\(\\|v\\|^2 = |\\langle v, e_1 \\rangle|^2 + \\cdots + |\\langle v, e_m \\rangle|^2\\), it implies that the entire \"energy\" or norm of \\( v \\) is captured by its projections onto the vectors \\( e_1, \\ldots, e_m \\). This means there is no component of \\( v \\) orthogonal to the span of these vectors, so \\( v \\) must lie entirely within the span of \\((e_1, \\ldots, e_m)\\).\n\nThus, we have shown that \\(\\|v\\|^2 = |\\langle v, e_1 \\rangle|^2 + \\cdots + |\\langle v, e_m \\rangle|^2\\) if and only if \\( v \\) is in the span of \\((e_1, \\ldots, e_m)\\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

The set of all linear operators on \\( V \\) is denoted by \\(\\mathcal{L}(V)\\).\n\nFor a set of operators to be a subspace of \\(\\mathcal{L}(V)\\), it must satisfy three conditions:\n1. It must contain the zero operator.\n2. It must be closed under addition.\n3. It must be closed under scalar multiplication.\n\nThe zero operator is trivially normal because it commutes with its adjoint (which is also the zero operator), so the first condition is satisfied.\n\nNow, let's consider the closure under addition. Suppose \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are two normal operators on \\( V \\). For the set of normal operators to be a subspace, the sum \\( A + B \\) must also be normal. However, this is not generally true.\n\nTo see why, consider a simple example in \\(\\mathbb{C}^2\\), the 2-dimensional complex vector space. Let \\( A \\) be the operator represented by the matrix \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\) and \\( B \\) be the operator represented by the matrix \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\). Both \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are normal because they are diagonal matrices, and diagonal matrices commute with their adjoints.\n\nHowever, the sum \\( A + B = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\) is also a diagonal matrix and thus normal. But let's consider a different pair of normal operators: let \\( C = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\) and \\( D = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\). Both \\( C \\) and \\( D \\) are normal because they are nilpotent and their adjoints are \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\) and \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\), respectively, which commute with the original matrices.\n\nHowever, the sum \\( C + D = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\) is not normal because it does not commute with its adjoint \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\). Specifically, \\((C + D)(C + D)^* \\neq (C + D)^*(C + D)\\).\n\nThis example shows that the sum of two normal operators is not necessarily normal, violating the closure under addition condition. Therefore, the set of normal operators is not a subspace of \\(\\mathcal{L}(V)\\) when \\(\\operatorname{dim} V \\geq 2\\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  LinearMap.mk fun v => v\nargument\n  fun v => v\nhas type\n  ?m.15968 \u2192 ?m.15968 : Sort ?u.15967\nbut is expected to have type\n  AddHom V V : Type u_1\napplication type mismatch\n  LinearMap.mk fun v => v\nargument\n  fun v => v\nhas type\n  ?m.20433 \u2192 ?m.20433 : Sort ?u.20432\nbut is expected to have type\n  AddHom V V : Type u_1\ntype mismatch\n  h\nhas type\n  \u2203 T \u2209 U, T * adjoint T = adjoint T * T : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  False : Prop\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  U.carrier\ncase h.left\nV : Type u_1\ninst\u271d\u00b2 : NormedAddCommGroup V\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : InnerProductSpace \u2102 V\ninst\u271d : FiniteDimensional \u2102 V\nhV : finrank V \u2265 2\nU : Submodule \u2102 (End \u2102 V)\nhU : U.carrier = {T | T * adjoint T = adjoint T * T}\nhT this : 0 \u2208 U\n\u22a2 False\ninvalid `\u25b8` notation, expected result type of cast is \n  T \u2208 U\nhowever, the equality \n  hU\nof type \n  U.carrier = {T | T * adjoint T = adjoint T * T}\ndoes not contain the expected result type on either the left or the right hand side\nPlease revise the proof.",

A normal operator \\( T \\) on a complex inner-product space is one that commutes with its adjoint, i.e., \\( TT^* = T^*T \\). A self-adjoint operator is a special type of normal operator where the operator is equal to its adjoint, \\( T = T^* \\). In the context of complex spaces, self-adjoint operators have the important property that all their eigenvalues are real.\n\nNow, let's prove the statement in two parts: \n\n1. **If \\( T \\) is self-adjoint, then all its eigenvalues are real.**\n\n   Suppose \\( T \\) is self-adjoint. This means \\( T = T^* \\). Consider an eigenvalue \\( \\lambda \\) of \\( T \\) with a corresponding eigenvector \\( v \\), so \\( Tv = \\lambda v \\). Taking the inner product of both sides with \\( v \\), we have:\n   \\[\n   \\langle Tv, v \\rangle = \\langle \\lambda v, v \\rangle = \\lambda \\langle v, v \\rangle.\n   \\]\n   Since \\( T \\) is self-adjoint, we also have:\n   \\[\n   \\langle Tv, v \\rangle = \\langle v, Tv \\rangle = \\langle v, \\lambda v \\rangle = \\overline{\\lambda} \\langle v, v \\rangle.\n   \\]\n   Equating the two expressions for \\( \\langle Tv, v \\rangle \\), we get:\n   \\[\n   \\lambda \\langle v, v \\rangle = \\overline{\\lambda} \\langle v, v \\rangle.\n   \\]\n   Assuming \\( \\langle v, v \\rangle \\neq 0 \\) (since \\( v \\) is an eigenvector and not the zero vector), we can divide both sides by \\( \\langle v, v \\rangle \\) to obtain \\( \\lambda = \\overline{\\lambda} \\). This implies that \\( \\lambda \\) is real.\n\n2. **If all eigenvalues of \\( T \\) are real, then \\( T \\) is self-adjoint.**\n\n   Now, assume all eigenvalues of \\( T \\) are real. Since \\( T \\) is normal, it can be diagonalized by a unitary matrix. This means there exists a unitary matrix \\( U \\) such that \\( U^*TU = D \\), where \\( D \\) is a diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues of \\( T \\) on its diagonal. Since all eigenvalues are real, \\( D \\) is a real diagonal matrix.\n\n   Consider the adjoint of \\( T \\), denoted \\( T^* \\). Since \\( T \\) is normal, we have \\( T^* = UDU^* \\). But since \\( D \\) is real, \\( D^* = D \\). Therefore, \\( T^* = UDU^* = T \\), showing that \\( T \\) is self-adjoint.\n\nIn conclusion, we have shown that a normal operator on a complex inner-product space is self-adjoint if and only if all its eigenvalues are real.

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, recall that an operator \\( T \\) on a complex inner-product space \\( V \\) is called normal if it commutes with its adjoint, i.e., \\( TT^* = T^*T \\). This property is crucial because it allows us to use the spectral theorem, which states that any normal operator can be diagonalized. Specifically, there exists an orthonormal basis of \\( V \\) consisting of eigenvectors of \\( T \\), and \\( T \\) can be expressed as a diagonal matrix with respect to this basis.\n\nNow, let's consider the eigenvalues of \\( T \\). Since \\( T \\) is normal, all its eigenvalues are complex numbers. The spectral theorem tells us that \\( T \\) can be written as \\( T = UDU^* \\), where \\( U \\) is a unitary operator (essentially a change of basis matrix) and \\( D \\) is a diagonal matrix whose entries are the eigenvalues of \\( T \\).\n\nTo find a square root of \\( T \\), we need an operator \\( S \\) such that \\( S^2 = T \\). A natural approach is to consider the square roots of the eigenvalues of \\( T \\). For each eigenvalue \\( \\lambda \\) of \\( T \\), we can choose a complex number \\( \\mu \\) such that \\( \\mu^2 = \\lambda \\). Since every complex number has a square root, this is always possible.\n\nConstruct a diagonal matrix \\( D' \\) where each diagonal entry is a square root of the corresponding entry in \\( D \\). That is, if \\( D = \\text{diag}(\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\ldots, \\lambda_n) \\), then \\( D' = \\text{diag}(\\mu_1, \\mu_2, \\ldots, \\mu_n) \\) where \\( \\mu_i^2 = \\lambda_i \\).\n\nNow, define the operator \\( S = UD'U^* \\). This operator \\( S \\) is also normal because it is constructed in the same way as \\( T \\), using the unitary matrix \\( U \\) and a diagonal matrix \\( D' \\). Moreover, we have:\n\n\\[ S^2 = (UD'U^*)(UD'U^*) = UD'U^*UD'U^* = UD'(U^*U)D'U^* = UD'D'U^* = U(D')^2U^* = UDU^* = T. \\]\n\nThus, \\( S^2 = T \\), showing that \\( S \\) is indeed a square root of \\( T \\).\n\nIn summary, by using the spectral theorem and the fact that every complex number has a square root, we can construct a square root for any normal operator on a complex inner-product space.

In other words, we need to see if $a \\star b$ is always equal to $b \\star a$ for any integers $a$ and $b$.\n\nLet's start by understanding what it means for an operation to be commutative. An operation $\\star$ is commutative if, for every pair of elements $a$ and $b$ in the set, the result of applying the operation does not depend on the order of the elements. Mathematically, this means $a \\star b = b \\star a$ for all $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nNow, let's apply the operation $\\star$ to two arbitrary integers $a$ and $b$. According to the definition, $a \\star b = a - b$. Similarly, if we reverse the order, we have $b \\star a = b - a$.\n\nFor the operation to be commutative, these two expressions must be equal: $a - b$ should equal $b - a$. Let's see if this is true.\n\nConsider the expression $a - b$. This represents the integer you get when you subtract $b$ from $a$. On the other hand, $b - a$ represents the integer you get when you subtract $a$ from $b$. \n\nFor these two expressions to be equal, $a - b = b - a$, we can rearrange the terms to get $a + a = b + b$, or $2a = 2b$. This implies $a = b$. \n\nHowever, the requirement $a = b$ is not true for all integers $a$ and $b$. For example, if we choose $a = 3$ and $b = 5$, then $a - b = 3 - 5 = -2$, while $b - a = 5 - 3 = 2$. Clearly, $-2 \\neq 2$, which shows that $a \\star b \\neq b \\star a$ for these particular values of $a$ and $b$.\n\nSince we have found at least one pair of integers for which $a \\star b \\neq b \\star a$, we can conclude that the operation $\\star$ is not commutative on $\\mathbb{Z}$.

The notation $\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$ represents the set of all integers modulo $n$. In simpler terms, it's the set of integers from $0$ to $n-1$, where each integer represents a class of numbers that have the same remainder when divided by $n$.\n\nWhen we talk about multiplication in this context, we're referring to multiplying these classes of numbers. For example, if we have two numbers $a$ and $b$ in $\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$, their product is the remainder of the product $a \\times b$ when divided by $n$. This is denoted as $[a] \\times [b] = [a \\times b \\mod n]$.\n\nNow, let's consider three elements $[a]$, $[b]$, and $[c]$ in $\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$. We want to show that the way we group these elements when multiplying doesn't affect the result. In other words, we need to show that $([a] \\times [b]) \\times [c] = [a] \\times ([b] \\times [c])$.\n\n1. **Calculate $([a] \\times [b]) \\times [c]$:**\n   - First, compute $[a] \\times [b]$.

So, we have $[a] \\times ([b \\times c \\mod n]) = [a \\times (b \\times c \\mod n) \\mod n]$.\n\n3. **Show these are equal:**\n   - Notice that both expressions ultimately depend on the product $a \\times b \\times c$. The first expression simplifies to $[(a \\times b \\times c) \\mod n]$, and the second expression also simplifies to $[(a \\times b \\times c) \\mod n]$.\n   - This is because multiplication of integers is associative, meaning $(a \\times b) \\times c = a \\times (b \\times c)$ for any integers $a$, $b$, and $c$. Since we're only concerned with the remainder when divided by $n$, the order of multiplication doesn't affect the final result.\n\nTherefore, the multiplication operation in $\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$ is associative because it inherits this property from the usual multiplication of integers.

Therefore, \\( x^{n-1} \\) must be the inverse of \\( x \\), which means:\n\n\\[ x^{-1} = x^{n-1}. \\]\n\nThis reasoning shows that \\( x^{n-1} \\) effectively \"undoes\" the effect of \\( x \\), bringing us back to the identity element, which is exactly what the inverse of an element should do. Thus, we have proven that if the order of \\( x \\) is \\( n \\), then \\( x^{-1} = x^{n-1} \\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

In the context of real numbers, the absolute value of a number is its distance from zero on the number line, which is always non-negative. For any real numbers \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), the absolute value of their product is the product of their absolute values: \\(|xy| = |x||y|\\).\n\nNow, let's apply this understanding to the elements \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in the group \\(G\\). The group \\(G\\) is a set equipped with a binary operation (let's call it multiplication for convenience) that satisfies certain properties, such as associativity, the existence of an identity element, and the existence of inverses for each element.\n\nThe problem asks us to show that \\(|ab| = |ba|\\). This is essentially a statement about the commutative property of absolute values in multiplication. In the context of real numbers, multiplication is commutative, meaning that the order of multiplication does not affect the product: \\(ab = ba\\). Therefore, the absolute value of the product is the same regardless of the order: \\(|ab| = |ba|\\).\n\nIn a more general sense, even if \\(G\\) is not necessarily a group of real numbers, the absolute value function (or its equivalent in the context of \\(G\\)) is typically defined in a way that respects the commutative property of multiplication. Thus, the absolute value of the product of two elements is independent of the order in which they are multiplied.\n\nTherefore, for any elements \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in the group \\(G\\), the absolute value of their product is the same regardless of the order: \\(|ab| = |ba|\\).

A group is abelian if it is a set equipped with a binary operation (like addition or multiplication) that is associative, has an identity element, every element has an inverse, and the operation is commutative.\n\nNow, consider the Cartesian product \\( A \\times B \\). The elements of \\( A \\times B \\) are ordered pairs \\((a, b)\\) where \\( a \\in A \\) and \\( b \\in B \\). We define the operation on \\( A \\times B \\) component-wise. That is, for two elements \\((a_1, b_1)\\) and \\((a_2, b_2)\\) in \\( A \\times B \\), their product is \\((a_1 \\cdot a_2, b_1 \\cdot b_2)\\), where \\(\\cdot\\) denotes the group operation in \\( A \\) and \\( B \\).\n\n- **Associativity:** Since both \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are groups, their operations are associative. Therefore, for any three elements \\((a_1, b_1)\\), \\((a_2, b_2)\\), and \\((a_3, b_3)\\) in \\( A \\times B \\), we have:\n  \\[\n  ((a_1, b_1) \\cdot (a_2, b_2)) \\cdot (a_3, b_3) = (a_1 \\cdot a_2, b_1 \\cdot b_2) \\cdot (a_3, b_3) = ((a_1 \\cdot a_2) \\cdot a_3, (b_1 \\cdot b_2) \\cdot b_3)\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  = (a_1 \\cdot (a_2 \\cdot a_3), b_1 \\cdot (b_2 \\cdot b_3)) = (a_1, b_1) \\cdot ((a_2, b_2) \\cdot (a_3, b_3))\n  \\]\n  Thus, the operation is associative.\n\n- **Identity Element:** The identity element in \\( A \\times B \\) is \\((e_A, e_B)\\), where \\( e_A \\) is the identity in \\( A \\) and \\( e_B \\) is the identity in \\( B \\). For any \\((a, b) \\in A \\times B\\), we have:\n  \\[\n  (a, b) \\cdot (e_A, e_B) = (a \\cdot e_A, b \\cdot e_B) = (a, b)\n  \\]\n  and similarly \\((e_A, e_B) \\cdot (a, b) = (a, b)\\).\n\n- **Inverses:** For any \\((a, b) \\in A \\times B\\), the inverse is \\((a^{-1}, b^{-1})\\), where \\( a^{-1} \\) is the inverse of \\( a \\) in \\( A \\) and \\( b^{-1} \\) is the inverse of \\( b \\) in \\( B \\).

We need to show that both \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are abelian.\n\n- **Commutativity in \\( A \\):** Take any two elements \\( a_1, a_2 \\in A \\). Consider the elements \\((a_1, e_B)\\) and \\((a_2, e_B)\\) in \\( A \\times B \\). Since \\( A \\times B \\) is abelian, we have:\n  \\[\n  (a_1, e_B) \\cdot (a_2, e_B) = (a_2, e_B) \\cdot (a_1, e_B)\n  \\]\n  This implies \\((a_1 \\cdot a_2, e_B) = (a_2 \\cdot a_1, e_B)\\), so \\( a_1 \\cdot a_2 = a_2 \\cdot a_1 \\). Thus, \\( A \\) is abelian.\n\n- **Commutativity in \\( B \\):** Similarly, take any two elements \\( b_1, b_2 \\in B \\).

Thus, \\( B \\) is abelian.\n\nTherefore, if \\( A \\times B \\) is abelian, then both \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) must be abelian.\n\nIn conclusion, \\( A \\times B \\) is an abelian group if and only if both \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are abelian groups.\nPrevious attempt failed with: function expected at\n  h\nterm has type\n  x * y = y * x\nfunction expected at\n  h\nterm has type\n  x * y = y * x\noverloaded, errors \n  10:35 overloaded, errors \n    10:60 application type mismatch\n      Prod.ext (hA a b)\n    argument\n      hA a b\n    has type\n      a * b = b * a : Prop\n    but is expected to have type\n      (?m.7616 a b).1 = (?m.7617 a b).1 : Prop\n    \n    10:66 application type mismatch\n      hA a b\n    argument\n      b\n    has type\n      ?m.8294 a \u00d7 ?m.8295 a : Type (max ?u.8283 ?u.8284)\n    but is expected to have type\n      A : Type u_1\n  \n  10:35 overloaded, errors \n    10:64 application type mismatch\n      hA a\n    argument\n      a\n    has type\n      (x : ?m.9359) \u2192 ?m.9378 x \u00d7 ?m.9379 x : Type ?u.7611\n    but is expected to have type\n      A : Type u_1\n    \n    10:64 application type mismatch\n      hA a\n    argument\n      a\n    has type\n      (?m.10463 \u00d7 ?m.10464)[X] : Type (max ?u.10454 ?u.10455)\n    but is expected to have type\n      A : Type u_1\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: function expected at\n  h\nterm has type\n  x * y = y * x\nfunction expected at\n  h\nterm has type\n  x * y = y * x\noverloaded, errors \n  10:35 overloaded, errors \n    10:60 application type mismatch\n      Prod.ext (hA a b)\n    argument\n      hA a b\n    has type\n      a * b = b * a : Prop\n    but is expected to have type\n      (?m.7616 a b).1 = (?m.7617 a b).1 : Prop\n    \n    10:66 application type mismatch\n      hA a b\n    argument\n      b\n    has type\n      ?m.8294 a \u00d7 ?m.8295 a : Type (max ?u.8283 ?u.8284)\n    but is expected to have type\n      A : Type u_1\n  \n  10:35 overloaded, errors \n    10:64 application type mismatch\n      hA a\n    argument\n      a\n    has type\n      (x : ?m.9359) \u2192 ?m.9378 x \u00d7 ?m.9379 x : Type ?u.7611\n    but is expected to have type\n      A : Type u_1\n    \n    10:64 application type mismatch\n      hA a\n    argument\n      a\n    has type\n      (?m.10463 \u00d7 ?m.10464)[X] : Type (max ?u.10454 ?u.10455)\n    but is expected to have type\n      A : Type u_1\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: function expected at\n  h\nterm has type\n  x * y = y * x\nfunction expected at\n  h\nterm has type\n  x * y = y * x\noverloaded, errors \n  10:35 overloaded, errors \n    10:60 application type mismatch\n      Prod.ext (hA a b)\n    argument\n      hA a b\n    has type\n      a * b = b * a : Prop\n    but is expected to have type\n      (?m.7616 a b).1 = (?m.7617 a b).1 : Prop\n    \n    10:66 application type mismatch\n      hA a b\n    argument\n      b\n    has type\n      ?m.8294 a \u00d7 ?m.8295 a : Type (max ?u.8283 ?u.8284)\n    but is expected to have type\n      A : Type u_1\n  \n  10:35 overloaded, errors \n    10:64 application type mismatch\n      hA a\n    argument\n      a\n    has type\n      (x : ?m.9359) \u2192 ?m.9378 x \u00d7 ?m.9379 x : Type ?u.7611\n    but is expected to have type\n      A : Type u_1\n    \n    10:64 application type mismatch\n      hA a\n    argument\n      a\n    has type\n      (?m.10463 \u00d7 ?m.10464)[X] : Type (max ?u.10454 ?u.10455)\n    but is expected to have type\n      A : Type u_1\nPlease revise the proof.",

The notation \\( S_{\\Omega} \\) typically denotes the symmetric group on the set \\( \\Omega \\). In this context, \\( \\Omega = \\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\} \\), which is the set of all positive integers. The symmetric group on a set is the group of all permutations of that set. A permutation is essentially a rearrangement of the elements of the set.\n\nNow, let's consider what it means for a group to be infinite. A group is infinite if it has an infinite number of elements. In the case of \\( S_{\\Omega} \\), this means there are infinitely many distinct permutations of the set \\( \\Omega \\).\n\nTo see why \\( S_{\\Omega} \\) is infinite, consider the following reasoning:\n\n1. **Infinite Set of Elements**: The set \\( \\Omega = \\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\} \\) is infinite because it contains all positive integers. There is no largest integer, and you can always find another integer by adding 1 to any given integer.\n\n2. **Permutations of Infinite Sets**: For any finite subset of \\( \\Omega \\), say \\( \\{1, 2, \\ldots, n\\} \\), the number of permutations is \\( n! \\) (n factorial), which grows very quickly as \\( n \\) increases. However, since \\( \\Omega \\) itself is infinite, we can consider permutations that affect only a finite number of elements while leaving the rest unchanged. \n\n3. **Constructing Infinite Permutations**: We can construct infinitely many such permutations. For example, consider the permutation that swaps 1 and 2 and leaves all other elements unchanged. Similarly, we can swap 1 and 3, 1 and 4, and so on. Each of these is a distinct permutation, and there are infinitely many such swaps.\n\n4. **Infinite Combinations**: Beyond simple swaps, we can create more complex permutations by combining these swaps. For instance, we can swap 1 and 2, then 3 and 4, and so on. The number of ways to combine these swaps is infinite, leading to an infinite number of distinct permutations.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since we can construct infinitely many distinct permutations of \\( \\Omega \\), the group \\( S_{\\Omega} \\) must be infinite. Each permutation corresponds to a unique element of the group, and since there are infinitely many permutations, there are infinitely many elements in the group.\n\nThus, \\( S_{\\Omega} \\) is indeed an infinite group because it contains an infinite number of permutations of the infinite set \\( \\Omega \\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  Infinite (Equiv.Perm \u2115)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  Infinite (Equiv.Perm \u2115)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  Infinite (Equiv.Perm \u2115)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nPlease revise the proof.",

Since \\( \\sigma \\) is an automorphism, it preserves the group operation, so we have:\n\n\\[\n\\sigma(ab) = \\sigma(a)\\sigma(b).\n\\]\n\nWe also know that \\( \\sigma^2 \\) is the identity, so applying \\( \\sigma \\) again, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\sigma(\\sigma(ab)) = \\sigma(\\sigma(a)\\sigma(b)) = ab.\n\\]\n\nSince \\( \\sigma \\) is an automorphism, it is bijective, and thus \\( \\sigma(a) \\neq a \\) and \\( \\sigma(b) \\neq b \\) unless \\( a = 1 \\) or \\( b = 1 \\). However, we are interested in the general case where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are arbitrary elements of \\( G \\).\n\nNow, consider the element \\( x = a\\sigma(a) \\). Applying \\( \\sigma \\) to \\( x \\), we have:\n\n\\[\n\\sigma(x) = \\sigma(a\\sigma(a)) = \\sigma(a)\\sigma(\\sigma(a)) = \\sigma(a)a.\n\\]\n\nSince \\( \\sigma^2(a) = a \\), we have \\( \\sigma(\\sigma(a)) = a \\), so:\n\n\\[\n\\sigma(x) = \\sigma(a)a = a\\sigma(a) = x.\n\\]\n\nThus, \\( x \\) is fixed by \\( \\sigma \\), and since the only element fixed by \\( \\sigma \\) is the identity, we conclude that \\( x = 1 \\). Therefore, \\( a\\sigma(a) = 1 \\), which implies \\( \\sigma(a) = a^{-1} \\).\n\nNow, consider the product \\( ab \\). Applying \\( \\sigma \\), we have:\n\n\\[\n\\sigma(ab) = \\sigma(a)\\sigma(b) = a^{-1}b^{-1}.\n\\]\n\nApplying \\( \\sigma \\) again, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\sigma(\\sigma(ab)) = \\sigma(a^{-1}b^{-1}) = \\sigma(b^{-1})\\sigma(a^{-1}) = b a.\n\\]\n\nSince \\( \\sigma^2 \\) is the identity, we have:\n\n\\[\nab = \\sigma(\\sigma(ab)) = ba.\n\\]\n\nThus, for any elements \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) in \\( G \\), we have \\( ab = ba \\), which means \\( G \\) is abelian.

This is trivially a subgroup of \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\), and since it contains no nonzero elements, the condition about reciprocals is vacuously satisfied. So, \\( H = \\{0\\} \\) is indeed a valid solution.\n\nNow, let's explore the possibility that \\( H \\) is not just the trivial subgroup. Suppose there exists a nonzero element \\( x \\in H \\). According to the problem, this means \\( \\frac{1}{x} \\) must also be in \\( H \\). \n\nSince \\( H \\) is a subgroup, it must be closed under addition and subtraction. Therefore, if \\( x \\) and \\( \\frac{1}{x} \\) are in \\( H \\), then their sum \\( x + \\frac{1}{x} \\) is also in \\( H \\). Similarly, any integer multiple of \\( x \\), say \\( nx \\) for any integer \\( n \\), must also be in \\( H \\) because subgroups are closed under scalar multiplication by integers.\n\nNow, consider the element \\( \\frac{1}{x} \\). Since \\( \\frac{1}{x} \\in H \\), any integer multiple of \\( \\frac{1}{x} \\), say \\( n \\cdot \\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{n}{x} \\), must also be in \\( H \\). \n\nBy the closure properties of subgroups, we can combine these elements. For any rational number \\( \\frac{m}{n} \\), we can express it as \\( m \\cdot \\frac{1}{n} \\). If we choose \\( x = \\frac{1}{n} \\), then \\( \\frac{1}{x} = n \\) is in \\( H \\), and thus \\( m \\cdot \\frac{1}{n} = \\frac{m}{n} \\) is in \\( H \\).\n\nThis reasoning shows that if \\( H \\) contains any nonzero element, it must contain all rational numbers because we can construct any rational number using the closure properties of \\( H \\). Therefore, \\( H \\) must be the entire group \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\).\n\nIn conclusion, the subgroup \\( H \\) can either be the trivial subgroup \\(\\{0\\}\\) or the entire group \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\).

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what a maximal subgroup is. A subgroup \\( M \\) of \\( G \\) is called maximal if it is not equal to \\( G \\) itself, and there are no subgroups of \\( G \\) that lie strictly between \\( M \\) and \\( G \\). In other words, if \\( M \\subseteq K \\subseteq G \\), then \\( K \\) must be either \\( M \\) or \\( G \\).\n\nNow, consider the subgroup \\( H \\), which is a proper subgroup of \\( G \\). This means \\( H \\neq G \\). Our goal is to find a maximal subgroup \\( M \\) such that \\( H \\subseteq M \\).\n\nHere's the strategy: We will use the concept of a chain of subgroups. Start with \\( H \\) and consider all subgroups of \\( G \\) that contain \\( H \\). Among these subgroups, we are interested in finding a subgroup that is maximal with respect to inclusion, meaning there is no larger subgroup containing it other than \\( G \\).\n\nSince \\( G \\) is a finite group, the number of subgroups of \\( G \\) is also finite. This finiteness allows us to use a simple but powerful idea: if you have a collection of subgroups, you can always find a largest one with respect to inclusion. This is because you can list all the subgroups containing \\( H \\) and pick one that is not contained in any other subgroup except \\( G \\).\n\nTo be more precise, consider the set of all subgroups of \\( G \\) that contain \\( H \\). This set is non-empty because it includes at least \\( H \\) itself and \\( G \\). Since the group is finite, this set is finite. By the well-ordering principle (or simply by the fact that finite sets have maximal elements with respect to inclusion), there must be a subgroup \\( M \\) in this set that is maximal with respect to inclusion.\n\nThis subgroup \\( M \\) cannot be \\( G \\) because \\( H \\) is a proper subgroup of \\( G \\), and we are looking for a subgroup strictly larger than \\( H \\) but not equal to \\( G \\). Therefore, \\( M \\) is a maximal subgroup of \\( G \\) containing \\( H \\).\n\nIn conclusion, by considering the set of all subgroups of \\( G \\) that contain \\( H \\) and using the finiteness of \\( G \\), we can always find a maximal subgroup \\( M \\) that contains \\( H \\).

This means that the number of cosets of \\( H \\) in \\( G \\) is \\( p \\), a prime number. We are also given another subgroup \\( K \\) of \\( G \\) and need to show that either \\( K \\) is contained within \\( H \\), or the product of \\( H \\) and \\( K \\) is the whole group \\( G \\) with a specific index condition.\n\nLet's break this down:\n\n1. **Understanding the Index**: Since \\( H \\) is a normal subgroup of \\( G \\) with index \\( p \\), the quotient group \\( G/H \\) has exactly \\( p \\) elements. Because \\( p \\) is prime, \\( G/H \\) is a simple group, meaning it has no nontrivial normal subgroups other than itself and the trivial subgroup.\n\n2. **Considering the Subgroup \\( K \\)**: We have a subgroup \\( K \\leq G \\). We want to explore the relationship between \\( K \\) and \\( H \\).\n\n3. **Case 1: \\( K \\leq H \\)**: If \\( K \\) is entirely contained within \\( H \\), then the condition \\( K \\leq H \\) is satisfied, and we are done for this case.\n\n4. **Case 2: \\( K \\not\\leq H \\)**: If \\( K \\) is not contained in \\( H \\), then there exists some element \\( k \\in K \\) such that \\( k \\notin H \\). This implies that the coset \\( kH \\) is not the identity coset in \\( G/H \\).\n\n5. **Generating \\( G \\) with \\( H \\) and \\( K \\)**: Since \\( G/H \\) is a group of prime order \\( p \\), any non-identity element generates the entire group. The element \\( kH \\) in \\( G/H \\) is non-identity, so it must generate \\( G/H \\). This means that every element of \\( G/H \\) can be expressed as a power of \\( kH \\).\n\n6. **Concluding \\( G = HK \\)**: Since \\( kH \\) generates \\( G/H \\), it follows that \\( G = HK \\). This is because every coset of \\( H \\) in \\( G \\) can be expressed as \\( (kH)^n \\) for some integer \\( n \\), which means every element of \\( G \\) can be written as a product of elements from \\( H \\) and \\( K \\).\n\n7. **Index Condition**: Finally, we need to show that \\( |K : K \\cap H| = p \\). The subgroup \\( K \\cap H \\) is the intersection of \\( K \\) and \\( H \\), and it is a subgroup of both. The index \\( |K : K \\cap H| \\) represents the number of distinct cosets of \\( K \\cap H \\) in \\( K \\). Since \\( G = HK \\) and \\( H \\) has index \\( p \\) in \\( G \\), the number of cosets of \\( K \\cap H \\) in \\( K \\) must also be \\( p \\) to account for the entire group \\( G \\).\n\nIn summary, if \\( K \\) is not contained in \\( H \\), then \\( K \\) must combine with \\( H \\) to form the entire group \\( G \\), and the index condition \\( |K : K \\cap H| = p \\) naturally follows from the structure of the group and the properties of the prime index. Thus, for any subgroup \\( K \\leq G \\), either \\( K \\leq H \\) or \\( G = HK \\) with the specified index condition.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  Decidable (K \u2264 H)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  Finite \u21a5(H \u2294 K)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'relindex_dvd_of_le_normal'\ninvalid alternative name 'inl'\nunknown identifier 'relindex_eq_one_iff_disjoint'\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, equality or iff proof expected\n  ?m.922\ncase inl.h.h\np : Nat.Primes\nG : Type u_1\ninst\u271d : Group G\nH : Subgroup G\nhH : H.Normal\nhH1 : H.index = \u2191p\nK : Subgroup G\nh1 : H.relindex K = \u2191p\n\u22a2 H \u2294 K = \u22a4\nunknown identifier 'relindex_eq_one_iff_disjoint'\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, equality or iff proof expected\n  ?m.944\ncase inr.h\np : Nat.Primes\nG : Type u_1\ninst\u271d : Group G\nH : Subgroup G\nhH : H.Normal\nhH1 : H.index = \u2191p\nK : Subgroup G\nh1 : H.relindex K = 1\n\u22a2 K \u2264 H\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'relindex_eq_of_le_right'\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, equality or iff proof expected\n  ?m.1174\np : Nat.Primes\nG : Type u_1\ninst\u271d : Group G\nH : Subgroup G\nhH : H.Normal\nhH1 : H.index = \u2191p\nK : Subgroup G\nhK : \u00acK \u2264 H\n\u22a2 H.relindex K = H.index\nunknown identifier 'eq_top_of_relindex_eq_one'\nPlease revise the proof.",

The trivial subgroup has order 1, and by Cauchy's Theorem, there is a subgroup of order \\( m \\) (which is \\( G \\) itself).

A group is solvable if it has a series of subgroups, each one normal in the previous one, such that the successive quotients are abelian groups. In simpler terms, you can break down the group into simpler pieces (abelian groups) through a series of steps.\n\nNow, let's consider a solvable group \\( G \\). By definition, there exists a chain of subgroups:\n\n\\[ \\{e\\} = G_0 \\trianglelefteq G_1 \\trianglelefteq G_2 \\trianglelefteq \\cdots \\trianglelefteq G_n = G \\]\n\nwhere each quotient \\( G_{i+1}/G_i \\) is an abelian group.\n\nSuppose we have a normal subgroup \\( N \\) of \\( G \\) and we want to show that the quotient group \\( G/N \\) is solvable.

The crucial observation is that if \\( G_{i+1}/G_i \\) is abelian, then the corresponding quotient \\( (G_{i+1}/N)/(G_i/N) \\) is also abelian. This is because the structure of the quotient \\( G_{i+1}/G_i \\) being abelian is preserved when we further quotient by \\( N \\).\n\nTherefore, the series of subgroups for \\( G/N \\) mirrors the solvable series of \\( G \\), with each step being abelian. This means that \\( G/N \\) is solvable because it can be broken down into abelian pieces in a similar manner to \\( G \\).\n\nIn summary, the solvability of \\( G \\) ensures that we can construct a series of subgroups for \\( G/N \\) that satisfies the conditions for solvability, thus proving that quotient groups of a solvable group are indeed solvable.",

If \\( H \\) has finite index \\( n \\), this means there are exactly \\( n \\) such cosets.\n\nThe goal is to find a normal subgroup \\( K \\) of \\( G \\) such that \\( K \\leq H \\) and the index \\( |G:K| \\) is at most \\( n! \\). The factorial \\( n! \\) arises naturally in this context because it is the number of permutations of \\( n \\) elements, which will be relevant when considering the action of \\( G \\) on the cosets.\n\nHere's the strategy to construct such a subgroup \\( K \\):\n\n1. **Action on Cosets**: Consider the action of \\( G \\) on the set of left cosets \\( G/H \\) by left multiplication. This action induces a homomorphism from \\( G \\) to the symmetric group \\( S_n \\), which is the group of all permutations of the \\( n \\) cosets.

If \\( H \\) is a subgroup of \\( G \\) with index \\( p \\), it means that the number of distinct left cosets of \\( H \\) in \\( G \\) is \\( p \\). Since \\( G \\) has order \\( p^\\alpha \\), the order of \\( H \\) must be \\( \\frac{p^\\alpha}{p} = p^{\\alpha-1} \\).\n\nNow, consider the action of \\( G \\) on the set of left cosets of \\( H \\) in \\( G \\). This action is defined by left multiplication: for any \\( g \\in G \\) and a coset \\( aH \\), the action sends \\( aH \\) to \\( (ga)H \\). This action partitions the cosets into orbits, and by the Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem, the size of each orbit divides the order of \\( G \\).\n\nSince the index of \\( H \\) is \\( p \\), there are exactly \\( p \\) cosets, and thus the set of cosets can be viewed as a set with \\( p \\) elements. The group \\( G \\) acts on this set, and because \\( p \\) is prime, the possible sizes of orbits under this action are either 1 or \\( p \\).\n\nIf there is an orbit of size \\( p \\), it would mean that the action is transitive, and thus \\( H \\) would not be normal. However, if there is an orbit of size 1, it means that there is a coset \\( aH \\) such that for every \\( g \\in G \\), \\( g(aH) = aH \\), which implies \\( gaH = aH \\) for all \\( g \\in G \\). This condition is equivalent to saying that \\( g \\in aHa^{-1} \\), meaning \\( H \\) is invariant under conjugation by any element of \\( G \\), which is precisely the condition for \\( H \\) to be normal in \\( G \\).\n\nSince the only other possibility for the size of an orbit is \\( p \\), and the total number of cosets is \\( p \\), the only consistent scenario is that all orbits are of size 1. This means every coset is fixed by the action of \\( G \\), implying that \\( H \\) is normal in \\( G \\).\n\nThus, we conclude that every subgroup of index \\( p \\) in a group of order \\( p^\\alpha \\) is indeed normal.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  Fintype (G \u29f8 H)\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, equality or iff proof expected\n  ?m.6726\nG : Type u_1\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : Fintype G\ninst\u271d : Group G\np \u03b1 : \u2115\nhp : p.Prime\nha : \u03b1 > 0\nhG : card G = p ^ \u03b1\nH : Subgroup G\nhH : H.index = p\nthis\u271d\u00b9 : Fact p.Prime\nthis\u271d : Fintype G\nthis : Fintype \u21a5H\n\u22a2 H.Normal\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'QuotientGroup.quotientEquivOfIndex'\nunsolved goals\nG : Type u_1\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : Fintype G\ninst\u271d : Group G\np \u03b1 : \u2115\nhp : p.Prime\nha : \u03b1 > 0\nhG : card G = p ^ \u03b1\nH : Subgroup G\nhH : H.index = p\n\u22a2 H.Normal\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'QuotientGroup.quotientEquivOfIndex'\nunsolved goals\nG : Type u_1\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : Fintype G\ninst\u271d : Group G\np \u03b1 : \u2115\nhp : p.Prime\nha : \u03b1 > 0\nhG : card G = p ^ \u03b1\nH : Subgroup G\nhH : H.index = p\n\u22a2 H.Normal\nPlease revise the proof.",

Since \\( G \\) is an abelian group of order \\( pq \\), it has exactly \\( pq \\) elements.\n\nOne key result we can use is the classification of abelian groups of a given order. For a group of order \\( n \\), if the group is abelian, it can be expressed as a direct product of cyclic groups whose orders are powers of primes that divide \\( n \\). In our case, since \\( n = pq \\) and both \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) are primes, the possible abelian groups of this order are limited.\n\nNow, let's consider the structure of \\( G \\). Since \\( G \\) is abelian and its order is the product of two distinct primes, it can be expressed as a direct product of cyclic groups whose orders are powers of \\( p \\) and \\( q \\). However, because \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) are distinct primes, the only possible abelian group structure is \\( G \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_p \\times \\mathbb{Z}_q \\).\n\nNext, we need to determine if this group is cyclic.

The order of any non-zero element in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\) is \\( p \\), and the order of any non-zero element in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_q \\) is \\( q \\). Therefore, if we choose \\( a \\) to be a generator of \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\) and \\( b \\) to be a generator of \\( \\mathbb{Z}_q \\), the order of \\((a, b)\\) will be \\(\\text{lcm}(p, q) = pq\\).\n\nSince the order of \\((a, b)\\) is \\( pq \\), it means that \\((a, b)\\) generates the entire group \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\times \\mathbb{Z}_q \\).

To see why, consider the automorphism of \\( S_3 \\) that swaps two transpositions, say \\( (12) \\) and \\( (13) \\). This automorphism does not preserve \\( A_3 \\) because it maps some elements of \\( A_3 \\) to elements outside of \\( A_3 \\). Specifically, it can map an even permutation to an odd permutation, which means \\( A_3 \\) is not invariant under this automorphism.\n\nThus, \\( A_3 \\) is a normal subgroup of \\( S_3 \\) that is not characteristic, providing the example we need. This demonstrates that while all characteristic subgroups are normal, not all normal subgroups are characteristic.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'let'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'let'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'let'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

We are given that \\( H \\) is a subgroup of \\( K \\) (i.e., \\( H \\leq K \\)), \\( H \\) is characteristic in \\( K \\), and \\( K \\) is normal in \\( G \\). Our goal is to show that \\( H \\) is normal in \\( G \\).\n\nLet's break down what each of these conditions means:\n\n1. **Characteristic Subgroup**: \\( H \\) being characteristic in \\( K \\) means that any automorphism of \\( K \\) maps \\( H \\) to itself. In simpler terms, no matter how you \"rearrange\" the elements of \\( K \\) using an automorphism, \\( H \\) remains unchanged as a set.\n\n2. **Normal Subgroup**: \\( K \\) being normal in \\( G \\) means that for every element \\( g \\) in \\( G \\), the conjugate of \\( K \\) by \\( g \\) (denoted \\( gKg^{-1} \\)) is still \\( K \\). This implies that \\( K \\) is invariant under conjugation by any element of \\( G \\).\n\nNow, to show that \\( H \\) is normal in \\( G \\), we need to demonstrate that for every element \\( g \\) in \\( G \\), the conjugate of \\( H \\) by \\( g \\) (denoted \\( gHg^{-1} \\)) is still \\( H \\).\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n- Since \\( K \\) is normal in \\( G \\), for any \\( g \\in G \\), we have \\( gKg^{-1} = K \\). This means that conjugating \\( K \\) by any element of \\( G \\) results in \\( K \\) itself.\n\n- Now, consider any \\( g \\in G \\). Since \\( gKg^{-1} = K \\), the conjugation by \\( g \\) is essentially an automorphism of \\( K \\). This is because it is a bijective map from \\( K \\) to itself that respects the group operation.\n\n- Since \\( H \\) is characteristic in \\( K \\), it is invariant under all automorphisms of \\( K \\). Therefore, the specific automorphism given by conjugation with \\( g \\) (i.e., the map \\( x \\mapsto gxg^{-1} \\) for \\( x \\in K \\)) must map \\( H \\) to itself.\n\n- Thus, for any \\( g \\in G \\), \\( gHg^{-1} = H \\), which is exactly the condition for \\( H \\) to be normal in \\( G \\).\n\nIn summary, the characteristic property of \\( H \\) in \\( K \\) ensures that \\( H \\) is preserved under any automorphism of \\( K \\), including those induced by elements of \\( G \\) due to the normality of \\( K \\) in \\( G \\). Therefore, \\( H \\) is normal in \\( G \\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  H.Normal\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  H.Normal\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  H.Normal\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nPlease revise the proof.",

Let's start by understanding the structure of the group and the Sylow theorems.\n\nFirst, we note that the order of the group, 56, can be factored into prime numbers as $56 = 2^3 \\times 7$. This means the possible primes $p$ that divide the order of the group are 2 and 7. According to Sylow's theorems, for each prime $p$ dividing the order of the group, there exists a Sylow $p$-subgroup, and the number of such subgroups, denoted $n_p$, satisfies certain conditions.\n\nLet's consider the Sylow 2-subgroups first. The order of a Sylow 2-subgroup is $2^3 = 8$. According to Sylow's theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups, $n_2$, must divide the order of the group (56) and must also be congruent to 1 modulo 2. The divisors of 56 are 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 14, 28, and 56. Among these, the numbers that are congruent to 1 modulo 2 are 1, 7, and 56.\n\nIf $n_2 = 1$, then there is exactly one Sylow 2-subgroup, and it must be normal in the group, which is what we want to prove. If $n_2 = 7$ or $n_2 = 56$, we need to consider the Sylow 7-subgroups.\n\nNow, let's consider the Sylow 7-subgroups. The order of a Sylow 7-subgroup is 7. The number of Sylow 7-subgroups, $n_7$, must divide 56 and be congruent to 1 modulo 7. The divisors of 56 that satisfy this condition are 1 and 8.\n\nIf $n_7 = 1$, then there is exactly one Sylow 7-subgroup, and it must be normal in the group. This would also satisfy our requirement of having a normal Sylow $p$-subgroup.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possibilities:\n\n1. If $n_2 = 1$, we have a normal Sylow 2-subgroup, and we are done.\n2. If $n_2 = 7$, then $n_7$ must be 1 because 7 Sylow 2-subgroups would imply a total of $7 \\times 8 = 56$ elements, which is the entire group, leaving no room for more than one Sylow 7-subgroup. Thus, the Sylow 7-subgroup is normal.\n3. If $n_2 = 56$, this is not possible because it would imply more elements than the group has.\n\nTherefore, in all possible cases, the group of order 56 must have a normal Sylow $p$-subgroup for some prime $p$ dividing its order.

Let's start by understanding the structure of the group and the Sylow theorems.\n\nFirst, we factor the number 351 into its prime components. We find that 351 = 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 13 = 3^3 \u00d7 13. This tells us that the prime divisors of 351 are 3 and 13.\n\nAccording to Sylow's theorems, for each prime divisor $p$ of the order of the group, there exists a Sylow $p$-subgroup. The number of such Sylow $p$-subgroups, denoted by $n_p$, satisfies two conditions:\n1. $n_p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$ (meaning $n_p$ is congruent to 1 modulo $p$).\n2. $n_p$ divides the order of the group.\n\nLet's apply these conditions to our group of order 351.\n\n1. **Sylow 3-subgroups:**\n   - The order of a Sylow 3-subgroup is 3^3 = 27.\n   - The number of Sylow 3-subgroups, $n_3$, must satisfy $n_3 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$ and $n_3$ divides 351.\n   - The divisors of 351 are 1, 3, 9, 13, 27, 39, 117, and 351.\n   - Among these, the numbers that are congruent to 1 modulo 3 are 1, 13, and 39.\n   - Therefore, $n_3$ could be 1, 13, or 39.\n\n2. **Sylow 13-subgroups:**\n   - The order of a Sylow 13-subgroup is 13.\n   - The number of Sylow 13-subgroups, $n_{13}$, must satisfy $n_{13} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{13}$ and $n_{13}$ divides 351.\n   - The divisors of 351 are the same as before: 1, 3, 9, 13, 27, 39, 117, and 351.\n   - Among these, the numbers that are congruent to 1 modulo 13 are 1 and 39.\n   - Therefore, $n_{13}$ could be 1 or 39.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications of $n_p = 1$ for either prime $p$. If $n_p = 1$, the corresponding Sylow $p$-subgroup is unique and hence normal in the group.\n\n- If $n_3 = 1$, then the Sylow 3-subgroup is normal.\n- If $n_{13} = 1$, then the Sylow 13-subgroup is normal.\n\nSince $n_3$ can be 1, 13, or 39, and $n_{13}$ can be 1 or 39, we see that it is possible for either $n_3$ or $n_{13}$ to be 1. In either case, we have a normal Sylow $p$-subgroup.\n\nTherefore, a group of order 351 must have a normal Sylow $p$-subgroup for some prime $p$ dividing its order.

The order of the group, 105, can be factored into prime numbers as \\( 105 = 3 \\times 5 \\times 7 \\). According to Sylow's theorems, for each prime factor, there exists a corresponding Sylow subgroup, and the number of such subgroups, denoted \\( n_p \\), satisfies certain conditions.\n\nLet's start by considering the Sylow 5-subgroup. By Sylow's theorems, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups, \\( n_5 \\), must divide the order of the group, 105, and also satisfy \\( n_5 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5} \\). The divisors of 105 are 1, 3, 5, 7, 15, 21, 35, and 105. Among these, the numbers that are congruent to 1 modulo 5 are 1 and 21. Therefore, \\( n_5 \\) could be either 1 or 21. If \\( n_5 = 1 \\), then the Sylow 5-subgroup is unique and hence normal in \\( G \\).\n\nNext, consider the Sylow 7-subgroup. Similarly, the number of Sylow 7-subgroups, \\( n_7 \\), must divide 105 and satisfy \\( n_7 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7} \\). The divisors of 105 that are congruent to 1 modulo 7 are 1 and 15. Thus, \\( n_7 \\) could be either 1 or 15. If \\( n_7 = 1 \\), then the Sylow 7-subgroup is unique and hence normal in \\( G \\).\n\nNow, let's examine the Sylow 3-subgroup. The number of Sylow 3-subgroups, \\( n_3 \\), must divide 105 and satisfy \\( n_3 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3} \\). The divisors of 105 that are congruent to 1 modulo 3 are 1, 7, and 35. Thus, \\( n_3 \\) could be 1, 7, or 35. However, the exact value of \\( n_3 \\) is not crucial for our argument about the Sylow 5 and 7-subgroups.\n\nTo ensure that both the Sylow 5-subgroup and the Sylow 7-subgroup are normal, we need to show that \\( n_5 = 1 \\) and \\( n_7 = 1 \\). Suppose \\( n_5 \\neq 1 \\), then \\( n_5 = 21 \\). Similarly, if \\( n_7 \\neq 1 \\), then \\( n_7 = 15 \\). However, if both \\( n_5 = 21 \\) and \\( n_7 = 15 \\), the total number of elements in these subgroups would exceed 105, which is impossible. Therefore, at least one of \\( n_5 \\) or \\( n_7 \\) must be 1.\n\nSince the product of the possible values of \\( n_5 \\) and \\( n_7 \\) (21 and 15) exceeds the order of the group, it is impossible for both to be greater than 1 simultaneously. Thus, at least one of the Sylow 5-subgroup or the Sylow 7-subgroup must be normal. Given the constraints, it turns out that both \\( n_5 = 1 \\) and \\( n_7 = 1 \\) are the only feasible solutions, ensuring that both subgroups are normal.\n\nIn conclusion, \\( G \\) must have a normal Sylow 5-subgroup and a normal Sylow 7-subgroup.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown constant 'Sylow.card_modEq_one'\nunknown constant 'Sylow.card_modEq_one'\nunknown constant

Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, recall that a Sylow $p$-subgroup of a group is a maximal subgroup whose order is a power of a prime $p$. In this case, $P$ is a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$, and it is also normal in $G$. This normality condition is crucial because it implies that $P$ is invariant under conjugation by any element of $G$. In other words, for any element $g \\in G$, the conjugate $gPg^{-1}$ is still $P$.\n\nNow, consider the subgroup $H$ of $G$. We are interested in the intersection $P \\cap H$. This intersection is a subgroup of both $P$ and $H$. Since $P$ is a $p$-subgroup, any subgroup of $P$, including $P \\cap H$, must also be a $p$-subgroup. Therefore, $P \\cap H$ is a $p$-subgroup of $H$.\n\nNext, we need to show that $P \\cap H$ is not just any $p$-subgroup of $H$, but the unique Sylow $p$-subgroup of $H$. To do this, we use the fact that $P$ is normal in $G$. Because $P$ is normal, it is the only Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$ that is conjugate to itself. This property extends to any subgroup of $G$, including $H$. \n\nSuppose there is another Sylow $p$-subgroup $Q$ of $H$. By Sylow's theorems, any two Sylow $p$-subgroups of a group are conjugate to each other within that group. However, since $P$ is normal in $G$, any Sylow $p$-subgroup of $H$ that is conjugate to $P \\cap H$ within $H$ must actually be $P \\cap H$ itself. This is because $P$ being normal in $G$ means that any conjugate of $P$ within $G$ is just $P$, and this property restricts the possible Sylow $p$-subgroups of $H$ to just $P \\cap H$.\n\nTherefore, $P \\cap H$ is the only Sylow $p$-subgroup of $H$. It is unique because any other candidate would have to be conjugate to it within $H$, but the normality of $P$ in $G$ ensures that no such distinct conjugate can exist. Thus, $P \\cap H$ is the unique Sylow $p$-subgroup of $H$.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown constant 'Sylow.mem_toSubgroup'\nrcases tactic failed: a\u271d : (\u2191R).toSubsemigroup.1 x is not an inductive datatype\ninvalid constructor \u27e8...\u27e9, expected type must be an inductive type \n  (\u2191R).toSubsemigroup.1 x\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'apply' failed, failed to unify\n  ?P = ?Q\nwith\n  \u2191R = (H \u2293 \u2191P).subgroupOf H\nG : Type u_1\ninst\u271d\u00b2 : Group G\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : Fintype G\np : \u2115\nP : Sylow p G\nhP : (\u2191P).Normal\nH : Subgroup G\ninst\u271d : Fintype \u21a5H\nR : Sylow p \u21a5H\n\u22a2 \u2191R = (H \u2293 \u2191P).subgroupOf H\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'apply' failed, failed to unify\n  ?P = ?Q\nwith\n  \u2191R = (H \u2293 \u2191P).subgroupOf H\nG : Type u_1\ninst\u271d\u00b2 : Group G\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : Fintype G\np : \u2115\nP : Sylow p G\nhP : (\u2191P).Normal\nH : Subgroup G\ninst\u271d : Fintype \u21a5H\nR : Sylow p \u21a5H\n\u22a2 \u2191R = (H \u2293 \u2191P).subgroupOf H\nPlease revise the proof.",

Importantly, fields have no zero divisors, meaning if the product of two elements is zero, then at least one of the elements must be zero.\n\nA **subring** is a subset of a ring that is itself a ring with the same operations.

This means that \\( R \\) has a multiplicative identity, which is a requirement for being an integral domain.\n\n3. **No Zero Divisors**: The crucial part is to show that \\( R \\) has no zero divisors.

This suggests that \\( R \\) has a structure that allows for a kind of division algorithm, which is a strong hint towards the ability to generate ideals with single elements.\n\nNow, let's examine condition (ii): if we have a sequence of nonzero elements \\( a_1, a_2, a_3, \\ldots \\) in \\( R \\) such that each element divides the previous one (\\( a_{i+1} \\mid a_i \\)), then there exists a positive integer \\( N \\) such that for all \\( n \\geq N \\), \\( a_n \\) is a unit times \\( a_N \\).

This suggests that the zero divisors in this ring are quite structured: for each pair \\((x_{2k-1}, x_{2k})\\), at least one of the variables must be zero in any prime ideal containing the ideal \\((x_1 x_2, x_3 x_4, \\ldots)\\).\n\nTo find minimal prime ideals, consider the ideals generated by single variables: \\((x_1), (x_2), (x_3), (x_4), \\ldots\\). Each of these ideals is prime in the polynomial ring \\(\\mathbb{Z}[x_1, x_2, x_3, \\ldots]\\) because if a product of two polynomials is in one of these ideals, at least one of the polynomials must be in the ideal. When we take the quotient by \\((x_1 x_2, x_3 x_4, \\ldots)\\), these ideals remain prime because they do not contain any of the generators \\(x_{2k-1} x_{2k}\\) as long as they are generated by a single variable.\n\nMoreover, these ideals are minimal prime ideals in the quotient ring because they are prime and do not properly contain any other prime ideal that contains the ideal \\((x_1 x_2, x_3 x_4, \\ldots)\\). For instance, the ideal \\((x_1)\\) is minimal because any smaller ideal would not be prime or would not contain the necessary zero divisors.\n\nSince there are infinitely many variables \\(x_1, x_2, x_3, \\ldots\\), we can construct infinitely many such minimal prime ideals, each generated by a single variable. Therefore, the ring \\(\\mathbb{Z}[x_1, x_2, x_3, \\ldots] / (x_1 x_2, x_3 x_4, \\ldots)\\) indeed contains infinitely many minimal prime ideals.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

Essentially, two vector spaces are isomorphic if there is a bijective linear map between them. This means we can pair each vector in one space with exactly one vector in the other space in a way that preserves vector addition and scalar multiplication.\n\nFirst, let's consider the vector space \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\). Here, \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) is considered as a vector space where the scalars are rational numbers. The dimension of this vector space is uncountably infinite because \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) is uncountably infinite and any basis for \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) must also be uncountably infinite.\n\nNow, consider \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\), which is the set of all \\(n\\)-tuples of real numbers. As a vector space over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\), \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\) is also uncountably infinite. This is because each component of the \\(n\\)-tuple can be any real number, and since \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) itself is uncountably infinite, so is \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\).\n\nThe key point here is that both \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) and \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\) have the same cardinality when considered as vector spaces over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\). They both have an uncountably infinite dimension. This means that there exists a bijective linear map between them, which is the definition of an isomorphism between vector spaces.\n\nTo construct such a map, we can think of each real number in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) as being represented by an infinite sequence of rational coefficients (since \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) is a vector space over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\)). Similarly, each element of \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\) can be represented by \\(n\\) such sequences. The isomorphism can be constructed by interleaving these sequences or by any other method that pairs each element of \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) with a unique element of \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\) and vice versa, while preserving the operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication.\n\nThus, despite the apparent difference in structure (one being a single real line and the other being an \\(n\\)-dimensional space), \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) and \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\) are indeed isomorphic as vector spaces over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) because they share the same uncountably infinite dimension.

A topology on a set \\( X \\) is a collection of subsets of \\( X \\) that includes the empty set and \\( X \\) itself, and is closed under arbitrary unions and finite intersections.\n\nNow, consider a family of topologies \\(\\mathcal{T}_\\alpha\\) on \\( X \\). Each \\(\\mathcal{T}_\\alpha\\) is a topology, meaning it satisfies the conditions mentioned above. The union of all these topologies, denoted by \\(\\bigcup \\mathcal{T}_\\alpha\\), is the set of all subsets of \\( X \\) that appear in at least one of the topologies \\(\\mathcal{T}_\\alpha\\).\n\nThe problem arises when we check whether \\(\\bigcup \\mathcal{T}_\\alpha\\) satisfies the conditions to be a topology:\n\n1. **Contains the empty set and \\( X \\):** Each \\(\\mathcal{T}_\\alpha\\) contains the empty set and \\( X \\), so \\(\\bigcup \\mathcal{T}_\\alpha\\) will also contain these sets, as they are in every topology in the family.\n\n2. **Closed under arbitrary unions:** If we take any collection of sets from \\(\\bigcup \\mathcal{T}_\\alpha\\), their union should also be in \\(\\bigcup \\mathcal{T}_\\alpha\\). This is generally satisfied because if a set is in \\(\\bigcup \\mathcal{T}_\\alpha\\), it is in at least one \\(\\mathcal{T}_\\alpha\\), and since each \\(\\mathcal{T}_\\alpha\\) is closed under arbitrary unions, the union of any collection of such sets will be in the same \\(\\mathcal{T}_\\alpha\\).\n\n3. **Closed under finite intersections:** This is where the problem typically occurs. For \\(\\bigcup \\mathcal{T}_\\alpha\\) to be a topology, it must be closed under finite intersections. However, consider two sets \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) that are in \\(\\bigcup \\mathcal{T}_\\alpha\\). This means \\( A \\) is in some topology \\(\\mathcal{T}_\\beta\\) and \\( B \\) is in some (possibly different) topology \\(\\mathcal{T}_\\gamma\\). If \\(\\beta \\neq \\gamma\\), there is no guarantee that the intersection \\( A \\cap B \\) is in either \\(\\mathcal{T}_\\beta\\) or \\(\\mathcal{T}_\\gamma\\), or any other single topology in the family. Therefore, \\( A \\cap B \\) might not be in \\(\\bigcup \\mathcal{T}_\\alpha\\).\n\nTo illustrate this with a simple example, consider \\( X = \\{1, 2\\} \\) and two topologies on \\( X \\): \\(\\mathcal{T}_1 = \\{\\emptyset, \\{1\\}, X\\}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{T}_2 = \\{\\emptyset, \\{2\\}, X\\}\\). The union \\(\\bigcup \\mathcal{T}_\\alpha = \\{\\emptyset, \\{1\\}, \\{2\\}, X\\}\\) is not a topology because the intersection \\(\\{1\\} \\cap \\{2\\} = \\emptyset\\) is in the union, but if we consider the intersection of \\(\\{1\\}\\) and \\(\\{2\\}\\), it is \\(\\emptyset\\), which is fine, but if we consider the intersection of \\(\\{1\\}\\) and \\(\\{2\\}\\) with any other set, it might not be in the union. \n\nThus, the union of a family of topologies on \\( X \\) does not necessarily satisfy the requirement of being closed under finite intersections, and therefore, it does not need to be a topology on \\( X \\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: type mismatch\n  \u2115\nhas type\n  Type : Type 1\nbut is expected to have type\n  Type u_1 : Type (u_1 + 1)\ntype mismatch\n  \u2115\nhas type\n  Type : Type 1\nbut is expected to have type\n  Type u_2 : Type (u_2 + 1)\ntactic 'split_ifs' failed, no if-then-else conditions to split\ncase h.left\ni : sorryAx (Type u_2) true\n\u22a2 is_topology (sorryAx (Type u_1) true) (sorryAx (Set (Set (sorryAx (Type u_1) true))) true)\nsimp made no progress\nsimp made no progress\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: type mismatch\n  \u2115\nhas type\n  Type : Type 1\nbut is expected to have type\n  Type u_1 : Type (u_1 + 1)\ntype mismatch\n  \u2115\nhas type\n  Type : Type 1\nbut is expected to have type\n  Type u_2 : Type (u_2 + 1)\ntactic 'split_ifs' failed, no if-then-else conditions to split\ncase h.left\ni : sorryAx (Type u_2) true\n\u22a2 is_topology (sorryAx (Type u_1) true) (sorryAx (Set (Set (sorryAx (Type u_1) true))) true)\nsimp made no progress\nsimp made no progress\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: type mismatch\n  \u2115\nhas type\n  Type : Type 1\nbut is expected to have type\n  Type u_1 : Type (u_1 + 1)\ntype mismatch\n  \u2115\nhas type\n  Type : Type 1\nbut is expected to have type\n  Type u_2 : Type (u_2 + 1)\ntactic 'split_ifs' failed, no if-then-else conditions to split\ncase h.left\ni : sorryAx (Type u_2) true\n\u22a2 is_topology (sorryAx (Type u_1) true) (sorryAx (Set (Set (sorryAx (Type u_1) true))) true)\nsimp made no progress\nsimp made no progress\nPlease revise the proof.",

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, recall that a topology on a set $X$ is a collection of subsets of $X$ that includes the empty set and $X$ itself, and is closed under arbitrary unions and finite intersections. Now, when we say we want a topology that is \"contained in\" all the topologies $\\mathcal{T}_\\alpha$, we mean that every open set in this topology must also be an open set in each of the topologies $\\mathcal{T}_\\alpha$.\n\nThe idea is to find the largest such topology, meaning it should include as many open sets as possible while still being a subset of each $\\mathcal{T}_\\alpha$. The key to solving this problem is to use the concept of intersection.\n\nConsider the intersection of all the topologies $\\mathcal{T}_\\alpha$. This intersection, denoted by $\\bigcap_\\alpha \\mathcal{T}_\\alpha$, is the set of all subsets of $X$ that are open in every topology $\\mathcal{T}_\\alpha$. By definition, this intersection is contained in each $\\mathcal{T}_\\alpha$, because it consists only of those sets that are common to all the topologies.\n\nNow, we need to check if this intersection is itself a topology on $X$. For it to be a topology, it must satisfy the three conditions of a topology:\n\n1. **Contains the empty set and $X$:**\n   Since each $\\mathcal{T}_\\alpha$ is a topology, they all contain the empty set and $X$. Therefore, the intersection $\\bigcap_\\alpha \\mathcal{T}_\\alpha$ will also contain these sets.\n\n2. **Closed under arbitrary unions:**\n   Suppose we have a collection of sets $\\{U_i\\}$, each of which is in $\\bigcap_\\alpha \\mathcal{T}_\\alpha$. This means each $U_i$ is open in every $\\mathcal{T}_\\alpha$. Since each $\\mathcal{T}_\\alpha$ is a topology, the union $\\bigcup_i U_i$ is open in each $\\mathcal{T}_\\alpha$. Therefore, $\\bigcup_i U_i$ is in the intersection $\\bigcap_\\alpha \\mathcal{T}_\\alpha$.\n\n3. **Closed under finite intersections:**\n   Similarly, if we take a finite number of sets $U_1, U_2, \\ldots, U_n$ from $\\bigcap_\\alpha \\mathcal{T}_\\alpha$, each is open in every $\\mathcal{T}_\\alpha$. Since each $\\mathcal{T}_\\alpha$ is a topology, the intersection $U_1 \\cap U_2 \\cap \\ldots \\cap U_n$ is open in each $\\mathcal{T}_\\alpha$. Thus, this intersection is in $\\bigcap_\\alpha \\mathcal{T}_\\alpha$.\n\nSince $\\bigcap_\\alpha \\mathcal{T}_\\alpha$ satisfies all the conditions of a topology, it is indeed a topology on $X$. Moreover, it is the largest topology contained in all the $\\mathcal{T}_\\alpha$ because any larger collection of open sets would not be contained in at least one of the $\\mathcal{T}_\\alpha$.\n\nTherefore, the intersection $\\bigcap_\\alpha \\mathcal{T}_\\alpha$ is the unique largest topology on $X$ that is contained in all the topologies $\\mathcal{T}_\\alpha$.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token '\u22c2'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token '\u22c2'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token '\u22c2'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

A subbasis $\\mathcal{A}$ for a topology on a set $X$ is a collection of subsets of $X$ such that the smallest topology containing all the sets in $\\mathcal{A}$ is the topology generated by $\\mathcal{A}$. \n\nNow, let's consider what it means to generate a topology from a subbasis. The topology generated by a subbasis $\\mathcal{A}$ is the collection of all unions of finite intersections of elements of $\\mathcal{A}$. This means that to form an open set in this topology, you can take any number of sets from $\\mathcal{A}$, intersect them in any finite way, and then take unions of these intersections.\n\nThe problem asks us to show that this topology generated by $\\mathcal{A}$ is the same as the intersection of all topologies on $X$ that contain $\\mathcal{A}$. Let's break this down:\n\n1. **The Intersection of All Topologies Containing $\\mathcal{A}$:**\n   - Consider all possible topologies on $X$ that include every set in $\\mathcal{A}$. Each of these topologies is a collection of subsets of $X$ that includes $\\mathcal{A}$ and is closed under arbitrary unions and finite intersections.\n   - The intersection of all these topologies is the largest collection of sets that is common to all these topologies. This intersection must itself be a topology because the intersection of topologies is always a topology (since the intersection of collections closed under unions and intersections is also closed under these operations).\n\n2. **Why the Generated Topology is the Intersection:**\n   - The topology generated by $\\mathcal{A}$ is the smallest topology that contains $\\mathcal{A}$. This means it is the minimal collection of sets that is closed under arbitrary unions and finite intersections and includes all sets in $\\mathcal{A}$.\n   - Any topology that contains $\\mathcal{A}$ must also contain all unions of finite intersections of sets from $\\mathcal{A}$, because these operations are required to satisfy the definition of a topology. Therefore, the topology generated by $\\mathcal{A}$ is contained in every topology that includes $\\mathcal{A}$.\n   - Consequently, the topology generated by $\\mathcal{A}$ is a subset of the intersection of all such topologies.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the topology generated by $\\mathcal{A}$ is contained in every topology that includes $\\mathcal{A}$, and it is itself a topology, it must be the intersection of all these topologies. This is because the intersection of all topologies containing $\\mathcal{A}$ is the largest collection of sets that is common to all these topologies, and the generated topology is the smallest such collection that is still a topology.\n\nThus, the topology generated by the subbasis $\\mathcal{A}$ is indeed the intersection of all topologies on $X$ that contain $\\mathcal{A}$.

In the standard topology on \\(\\mathbb{R}\\), open sets are unions of open intervals \\((c, d)\\) where \\(c < d\\) and \\(c, d\\) are real numbers. For any such interval \\((c, d)\\), we can find rational numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) such that \\(c < a < b < d\\). This is possible because the rational numbers are dense in the real numbers, meaning between any two real numbers, there exists a rational number. Therefore, the interval \\((a, b)\\) is entirely contained within \\((c, d)\\), and since \\((c, d)\\) was arbitrary, any open interval can be covered by a union of intervals from our collection.\n\nNext, consider the basis property. Take any open set \\(U\\) in the standard topology and any point \\(x \\in U\\). Since \\(U\\) is open, there exists some open interval \\((c, d)\\) such that \\(x \\in (c, d) \\subseteq U\\). Again, using the density of the rationals, we can find rational numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) such that \\(c < a < x < b < d\\). Thus, the interval \\((a, b)\\) is a member of our collection and satisfies \\(x \\in (a, b) \\subseteq (c, d) \\subseteq U\\).\n\nBy showing that every open set in the standard topology can be expressed as a union of intervals from our collection and that for any point in an open set there is an interval from our collection containing it, we have demonstrated that the collection \\(\\{(a, b) \\mid a < b, a \\text{ and } b \\text{ rational}\\}\\) is indeed a basis for the standard topology on \\(\\mathbb{R}\\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  (IsOpen.mem_nhds_iff isOpen_Ioo).mp hS\nargument\n  hS\nhas type\n  IsOpen S : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  Ioo ?m.1495 ?m.1496 \u2208 \ud835\udcdd ?m.1499 : Prop\nrcases tactic failed: right\u271d : Preorder.toLT.1 ?m.1499 ?m.1496 is not an inductive datatype\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  IsOpen.mem_nhds isOpen_Ioo hxS\nargument\n  hxS\nhas type\n  x \u2208 S : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  x \u2208 Ioo ?m.1495 ?m.1496 : Prop\nrcases tactic failed: x\u271d : ?m.1885 is not an inductive datatype\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  mem_nhds_iff.mp hS\nargument\n  hS\nhas type\n  IsOpen S : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  ?m.1238 \u2208 \ud835\udcdd ?m.1237 : Prop\napplication type mismatch\n  IsOpen.mem_nhds isOpen_Ioo hxS\nargument\n  hxS\nhas type\n  x \u2208 S : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  x \u2208 Ioo ?m.2794 ?m.2795 : Prop\nrcases tactic failed: x\u271d : (\ud835\udcdd x).1 (Ioo ?m.2794 ?m.2795) is not an inductive datatype\nPlease revise the proof.",

When we say that a set $A$ inherits a topology from a larger space, we mean that the open sets in $A$ are determined by the open sets in the larger space.\n\nLet's break down the situation: We have a topological space $X$, and $Y$ is a subspace of $X$. This means that $Y$ has the subspace topology, which is derived from $X$. In this subspace topology, a set $U$ is open in $Y$ if and only if there exists an open set $V$ in $X$ such that $U = V \\cap Y$.\n\nNow, consider $A$, which is a subset of $Y$. We want to compare two topologies on $A$:\n\n1. The topology $A$ inherits as a subspace of $Y$.\n2. The topology $A$ inherits as a subspace of $X$.\n\nFor the first case, where $A$ is a subspace of $Y$, a set $U_A$ is open in $A$ if there exists a set $U_Y$ open in $Y$ such that $U_A = U_Y \\cap A$. Since $U_Y$ is open in $Y$, there is some open set $V$ in $X$ such that $U_Y = V \\cap Y$. Therefore, $U_A = (V \\cap Y) \\cap A = V \\cap (Y \\cap A) = V \\cap A$. This shows that $U_A$ is the intersection of $A$ with an open set in $X$.\n\nFor the second case, where $A$ is a subspace of $X$, a set $U_A$ is open in $A$ if there exists an open set $V$ in $X$ such that $U_A = V \\cap A$.\n\nNotice that in both cases, the open sets in $A$ are precisely those that can be expressed as the intersection of $A$ with some open set in $X$. This means that the criteria for a set to be open in $A$ are identical whether we consider $A$ as a subspace of $Y$ or as a subspace of $X$.\n\nTherefore, the topology that $A$ inherits as a subspace of $Y$ is exactly the same as the topology it inherits as a subspace of $X$.

Since the rational numbers are dense in the real numbers, for any real number \\(x\\), we can find rational numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) such that \\(a < x < b\\). Similarly, for any real number \\(y\\), we can find rational numbers \\(c\\) and \\(d\\) such that \\(c < y < d\\). Therefore, for any point \\((x, y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2\\), we can find a rectangle \\((a, b) \\times (c, d)\\) that contains \\((x, y)\\). This shows that the collection covers \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\).\n\n2. **Basis Criterion:**\n\n   To satisfy the basis criterion, for any open set \\(U\\) in \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\) and any point \\((x, y) \\in U\\), there must be a basis element \\((a, b) \\times (c, d)\\) such that \\((x, y) \\in (a, b) \\times (c, d) \\subseteq U\\).\n\n   Since \\(U\\) is open, there exists some \\(\\epsilon > 0\\) such that the open ball \\(B((x, y), \\epsilon)\\) is contained in \\(U\\). This ball is essentially a small open square centered at \\((x, y)\\). We can choose rational numbers \\(a, b, c, d\\) such that \\(x - \\epsilon < a < x < b < x + \\epsilon\\) and \\(y - \\epsilon < c < y < d < y + \\epsilon\\). The rectangle \\((a, b) \\times (c, d)\\) will then be contained in the open ball, and hence in \\(U\\). This shows that for any open set \\(U\\) and any point \\((x, y) \\in U\\), there is a basis element contained in \\(U\\) that includes \\((x, y)\\).\n\n3. **Countability:**\n\n   The set of all rational numbers is countable, and the set of all pairs of rational numbers is also countable. Therefore, the set of all quadruples \\((a, b, c, d)\\) where \\(a, b, c, d\\) are rational is countable. Since each quadruple corresponds to a rectangle \\((a, b) \\times (c, d)\\), the collection of these rectangles is countable.\n\nIn conclusion, the collection of rectangles \\((a, b) \\times (c, d)\\) with rational endpoints forms a basis for the topology on \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\) because it covers \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\), satisfies the basis criterion for open sets, and is countable.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unexpected token ','; expected '\u21a6', '=>'\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unexpected token ','; expected '\u21a6', '=>'\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unexpected token ','; expected '\u21a6', '=>'\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

A topological space \\( Y \\) is Hausdorff if for any two distinct points in \\( Y \\), there exist disjoint open sets containing each of the points. This property is crucial because it ensures that limits of sequences (or nets) in \\( Y \\) are unique.\n\nNow, consider the closure \\( \\bar{A} \\) of the set \\( A \\) in the space \\( X \\). The closure \\( \\bar{A} \\) includes all the points of \\( A \\) and any limit points of \\( A \\) in \\( X \\). The function \\( f \\) is given to be continuous on \\( A \\), and we are told that it can be extended to a continuous function \\( g \\) on \\( \\bar{A} \\).\n\nSuppose there are two continuous extensions of \\( f \\), say \\( g_1 \\) and \\( g_2 \\), both mapping from \\( \\bar{A} \\) to \\( Y \\).

Consider the set \\(\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}\\), which consists of all pairs \\((x, y)\\) where \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are real numbers. In the dictionary order, we say \\((x_1, y_1) < (x_2, y_2)\\) if either \\(x_1 < x_2\\), or \\(x_1 = x_2\\) and \\(y_1 < y_2\\). This is similar to how words are ordered in a dictionary: first by the first letter, then by the second letter if the first letters are the same, and so on.\n\nThe dictionary order topology on \\(\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}\\) is generated by the basis consisting of all intervals of the form:\n1. \\((a, b) \\times \\mathbb{R}\\), where \\(a, b \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) and \\(a < b\\),\n2. \\(\\{a\\} \\times (c, d)\\), where \\(a, c, d \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) and \\(c < d\\).\n\nNow, to show that this topology is metrizable, we need to find a metric that can generate the same open sets as this topology. A common approach is to use a metric that reflects the ordering of the pairs.\n\nConsider the following metric \\(d\\) on \\(\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}\\):\n\\[ d((x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2)) = \\begin{cases} \n|x_1 - x_2|, & \\text{if } x_1 \\neq x_2, \\\\\n|y_1 - y_2|, & \\text{if } x_1 = x_2.\n\\end{cases} \\]\n\nThis metric works as follows:\n- If the first components \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) are different, the distance is simply the absolute difference \\(|x_1 - x_2|\\). This reflects the primary ordering by the first component.\n- If the first components are the same, the distance is determined by the second components, \\(|y_1 - y_2|\\), reflecting the secondary ordering.\n\nThis metric \\(d\\) is indeed a valid metric because it satisfies all the properties of a metric: non-negativity, identity of indiscernibles, symmetry, and the triangle inequality.\n\nNow, let's see why this metric induces the dictionary order topology. Consider an open set in the dictionary order topology, such as \\((a, b) \\times \\mathbb{R}\\). Under our metric, this corresponds to the set of all points \\((x, y)\\) such that \\(a < x < b\\), which is clearly open in the metric topology because it can be expressed as a union of open balls centered at points in \\((a, b) \\times \\mathbb{R}\\).\n\nSimilarly, consider a set of the form \\(\\{a\\} \\times (c, d)\\). In the metric topology, this is open because for any point \\((a, y)\\) with \\(c < y < d\\), we can find a small enough \\(\\epsilon\\) such that the ball of radius \\(\\epsilon\\) around \\((a, y)\\) is entirely contained in \\(\\{a\\} \\times (c, d)\\).\n\nThus, every open set in the dictionary order topology can be expressed as a union of open sets in the metric topology defined by \\(d\\), and vice versa. Therefore, the dictionary order topology on \\(\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}\\) is indeed metrizable, as it can be generated by the metric \\(d\\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: unexpected end of input\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unexpected end of input\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unexpected end of input\nPlease revise the proof.",

For \\(x = 1\\), we have \\(f_n(1) = 1^n = 1\\) for all \\(n\\). For \\(x = 0\\), we have \\(f_n(0) = 0^n = 0\\) for all \\(n\\). So, at the endpoints of the interval \\([0, 1]\\), the function values are constant.\n\nNow, consider \\(x\\) in the open interval \\((0, 1)\\). For any such \\(x\\), as \\(n\\) increases, \\(x^n\\) becomes smaller and smaller because \\(0 < x < 1\\). In fact, as \\(n\\) approaches infinity, \\(x^n\\) approaches 0. Therefore, pointwise, the sequence \\(f_n(x) = x^n\\) converges to the function \\(f(x) = 0\\) for all \\(x \\in [0, 1)\\), and \\(f(1) = 1\\).\n\nHowever, for uniform convergence, we need the convergence to be uniform across the entire interval \\([0, 1]\\). This means that the rate of convergence should not depend on \\(x\\). Let's see if this is the case.\n\nConsider any small \\(\\epsilon > 0\\). We want to find an \\(N\\) such that for all \\(n \\geq N\\) and for all \\(x \\in [0, 1]\\), \\(|x^n - f(x)| < \\epsilon\\). Since \\(f(x) = 0\\) for \\(x \\in [0, 1)\\), this inequality becomes \\(|x^n| < \\epsilon\\), or simply \\(x^n < \\epsilon\\).\n\nThe problem arises when \\(x\\) is very close to 1. For example, if we take \\(x = 1 - \\frac{1}{n}\\), then \\(x^n = \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{n}\\right)^n\\). As \\(n\\) becomes large, this expression approaches \\(e^{-1}\\), which is approximately 0.3679, a value that is not arbitrarily small. Therefore, no matter how large \\(n\\) is, there will always be some \\(x\\) close to 1 for which \\(x^n\\) is not less than \\(\\epsilon\\) for small \\(\\epsilon\\).\n\nThis shows that the convergence is not uniform because we cannot find a single \\(N\\) that works for all \\(x \\in [0, 1]\\) to make \\(|x^n - f(x)| < \\epsilon\\). The convergence rate depends on \\(x\\), particularly as \\(x\\) approaches 1. Therefore, the sequence \\((f_n)\\) does not converge uniformly on \\([0, 1]\\).",

A space is connected if it cannot be split into two non-empty, disjoint open sets. In other words, there is no way to partition the space into two separate parts without losing some kind of \"link\" between them.\n\nLet's start by considering the set \\( A \\), which is given to be connected. This means that within \\( A \\), there is no way to split it into two non-empty, disjoint open sets. Now, we have a collection of connected subspaces \\( \\{A_{\\alpha}\\} \\) of \\( X \\). Each \\( A_{\\alpha} \\) is connected, meaning each one individually cannot be split into two non-empty, disjoint open sets.\n\nThe problem states that \\( A \\cap A_{\\alpha} \\neq \\varnothing \\) for all \\( \\alpha \\). This means that each \\( A_{\\alpha} \\) shares at least one point with \\( A \\). This shared point is crucial because it acts as a \"bridge\" or \"link\" between \\( A \\) and each \\( A_{\\alpha} \\).\n\nNow, consider the union \\( A \\cup \\left(\\bigcup A_{\\alpha}\\right) \\). We want to show that this entire set is connected. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that it is not connected. This would mean we could split \\( A \\cup \\left(\\bigcup A_{\\alpha}\\right) \\) into two non-empty, disjoint open sets, say \\( U \\) and \\( V \\).\n\nSince \\( A \\) is connected and is a subset of \\( A \\cup \\left(\\bigcup A_{\\alpha}\\right) \\), it must entirely lie within either \\( U \\) or \\( V \\) (because if it were split between \\( U \\) and \\( V \\), that would contradict the connectedness of \\( A \\)). Without loss of generality, assume \\( A \\subseteq U \\).\n\nNow, consider any \\( A_{\\alpha} \\). Since \\( A_{\\alpha} \\) is connected and \\( A \\cap A_{\\alpha} \\neq \\varnothing \\), the intersection point between \\( A \\) and \\( A_{\\alpha} \\) must also lie in \\( U \\) (since \\( A \\subseteq U \\)).

We have a space \\( X \\) and a subset \\( A \\subset X \\). The boundary of \\( A \\), denoted as \\(\\operatorname{Bd} A\\), consists of points that are neither entirely inside \\( A \\) nor entirely outside \\( A \\). More formally, a point is in the boundary if every neighborhood of that point contains points from both \\( A \\) and \\( X - A \\).\n\nNow, consider a connected subspace \\( C \\) of \\( X \\). A space is connected if it cannot be split into two disjoint non-empty open sets. The problem states that \\( C \\) intersects both \\( A \\) and \\( X - A \\). This means there are points in \\( C \\) that are in \\( A \\) and points in \\( C \\) that are not in \\( A \\).\n\nOur goal is to show that \\( C \\) must intersect the boundary of \\( A \\). Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Connectedness of \\( C \\):** Since \\( C \\) is connected, it cannot be split into two separate parts without breaking its connectedness. If \\( C \\) intersects both \\( A \\) and \\( X - A \\), then there must be a \"path\" or a continuous way within \\( C \\) that connects a point in \\( A \\) to a point in \\( X - A \\).\n\n2. **Transition from \\( A \\) to \\( X - A \\):** As you move along this path from a point in \\( A \\) to a point in \\( X - A \\), you must cross the boundary of \\( A \\). This is because the boundary is precisely where the transition between being inside \\( A \\) and outside \\( A \\) occurs.\n\n3. **Intersection with the Boundary:** Since \\( C \\) is connected and contains points from both \\( A \\) and \\( X - A \\), there must be at least one point on this path that lies on the boundary of \\( A \\). This is the point where the transition happens, and thus \\( C \\) must intersect \\(\\operatorname{Bd} A\\).\n\nIn summary, the connectedness of \\( C \\) ensures that it cannot \"jump\" from \\( A \\) to \\( X - A \\) without passing through the boundary. Therefore, \\( C \\) must intersect the boundary of \\( A \\).

A map \\( p: X \\rightarrow Y \\) is a quotient map if it is surjective and a set \\( U \\subseteq Y \\) is open if and only if \\( p^{-1}(U) \\) is open in \\( X \\).

Since \\( f \\) is an isometry, the sequence \\( \\{f^n(x_0)\\} \\) is bounded because it preserves distances. By compactness, this sequence has a convergent subsequence. Let this subsequence converge to some point \\( z \\in X \\).\n\nNow, because \\( f \\) is injective, it cannot have a periodic point unless the period is 1 (i.e., \\( f(x) = x \\)).

The space $[0, 1]^\\omega$ is the set of all infinite sequences where each element of the sequence is a number between 0 and 1. The uniform topology on this space is defined such that two sequences are \"close\" if they agree on a long initial segment and the values in that segment are close to each other.\n\nA space is locally compact if every point has a neighborhood that is compact. A set is compact if every open cover of the set has a finite subcover, which intuitively means that the set is \"small\" in a certain sense, like being closed and bounded in finite-dimensional spaces.\n\nNow, let's consider why $[0, 1]^\\omega$ is not locally compact. Suppose for contradiction that it is locally compact. Then, for any sequence $x = (x_1, x_2, x_3, \\ldots)$ in $[0, 1]^\\omega$, there exists a neighborhood $U$ of $x$ that is compact.\n\nConsider the sequence $x = (0, 0, 0, \\ldots)$, the constant sequence of all zeros. A typical neighborhood of $x$ in the uniform topology might be sequences that agree with $x$ on the first $n$ terms and are within some small $\\epsilon$ of $x$ on those terms. However, such a neighborhood is not compact.\n\nTo see why, consider the open cover of this neighborhood by sets that fix more and more terms of the sequence. Specifically, for each natural number $k$, consider the set of sequences that agree with $x$ on the first $k$ terms. These sets form an open cover of the neighborhood, but no finite subcollection of these sets can cover the entire neighborhood. This is because, for any finite collection of such sets, there will always be sequences that differ from $x$ beyond the largest $k$ in the collection, and thus are not covered.\n\nThis inability to find a finite subcover for the neighborhood of $x$ shows that the neighborhood is not compact. Since $x$ was arbitrary, this argument applies to any point in $[0, 1]^\\omega$, demonstrating that no point has a compact neighborhood. Therefore, $[0, 1]^\\omega$ is not locally compact in the uniform topology.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'Compactness.noncompact_space'\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'Compactness.noncompact_space'\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'Compactness.noncompact_space'\nPlease revise the proof.",

We have a collection of topological spaces, each of which has a countable dense subset. We are interested in the product of these spaces, and we want to show that this product space also has a countable dense subset.\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding Dense Subsets**: A subset \\( D \\) of a topological space \\( Y \\) is dense if every point in \\( Y \\) is either in \\( D \\) or is a limit point of \\( D \\). In simpler terms, \\( D \\) is dense if you can get arbitrarily close to any point in \\( Y \\) using points from \\( D \\).\n\n2. **Countable Product of Spaces**: We are considering a product of spaces \\( X = \\prod_{i \\in I} X_i \\), where each \\( X_i \\) is a topological space with a countable dense subset \\( D_i \\). The index set \\( I \\) is countable, meaning it can be put in one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers.\n\n3. **Constructing a Dense Subset for the Product**: The key idea is to construct a dense subset for the product space \\( X \\) using the dense subsets \\( D_i \\) of each \\( X_i \\).\n\n4. **Using the Countability**: Since each \\( D_i \\) is countable and \\( I \\) is countable, the product of these countable sets, \\( \\prod_{i \\in I} D_i \\), is also countable. This is because the countable product of countable sets is countable (a result from set theory).\n\n5. **Density in the Product Space**: We need to show that this countable product \\( \\prod_{i \\in I} D_i \\) is dense in \\( X \\). Consider any point \\( x = (x_i) \\) in \\( X \\) and any open set \\( U \\) containing \\( x \\). By the definition of the product topology, \\( U \\) contains a basic open set of the form \\( \\prod_{i \\in I} U_i \\), where each \\( U_i \\) is open in \\( X_i \\) and \\( U_i = X_i \\) for all but finitely many \\( i \\).\n\n6. **Approximating Points in the Product**: For each \\( i \\), if \\( U_i \\neq X_i \\), then \\( x_i \\) is in \\( U_i \\), and since \\( D_i \\) is dense in \\( X_i \\), there is a point \\( d_i \\in D_i \\cap U_i \\). For the indices where \\( U_i = X_i \\), we can simply choose any point from \\( D_i \\).\n\n7. **Constructing a Point in the Dense Subset**: By choosing such points \\( d_i \\) for each \\( i \\), we construct a point \\( d = (d_i) \\) in \\( \\prod_{i \\in I} D_i \\) that is in the open set \\( U \\). This shows that every open set in \\( X \\) contains a point from \\( \\prod_{i \\in I} D_i \\), proving that this set is dense in \\( X \\).\n\n8. **Conclusion**: Since \\( \\prod_{i \\in I} D_i \\) is countable and dense in \\( X \\), we have found a countable dense subset for the product space \\( X \\).\n\nThus, we have shown that if each space in a countable product has a countable dense subset, then the product space itself has a countable dense subset.\nPrevious attempt failed with: invalid field 'to_dense', the environment does not contain 'Set.Countable.to_dense'\n  to_countable (s i)\nhas type\n  (s i).Countable\ninvalid field 'to_dense', the environment does not contain 'Countable.to_dense'\n  to_countable (s i)\nhas type\n  Countable \u2191(s i)\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  Dense ?m.633\ncase h.right\nX : \u2115 \u2192 Type u_1\ninst\u271d : (i : \u2115) \u2192 TopologicalSpace (X i)\ns : (i : \u2115) \u2192 Set (X i)\nhsc : \u2200 (i : \u2115), Countable \u2191(s i)\nhd : \u2200 (i : \u2115), Dense (s i)\nx : (i : \u2115) \u2192 X i\n\u22a2 x \u2208 closure (range fun i => sorryAx ((i : \u2115) \u2192 X i) true)\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'using'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'using'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

This property allows us to separate points from closed sets using continuous functions.\n\nNow, let's see why a locally compact Hausdorff space is completely regular:\n\n- **Step 1: Use Local Compactness**: Take any point \\( x \\) and a closed set \\( F \\) in the space such that \\( x \\notin F \\). Since the space is locally compact, there exists a neighborhood \\( U \\) of \\( x \\) that is compact. \n\n- **Step 2: Use the Hausdorff Property**: Because the space is Hausdorff, for each point \\( y \\) in the closed set \\( F \\), we can find disjoint open sets separating \\( x \\) and \\( y \\). Since \\( U \\) is compact and \\( F \\) is closed, we can cover \\( F \\) with finitely many of these disjoint open sets. This gives us a finite subcover, which is crucial for the next step.\n\n- **Step 3: Construct a Continuous Function**: Using the finite subcover, we can construct a continuous function that separates \\( x \\) from \\( F \\). Specifically, we can define a function that is 0 at \\( x \\) and 1 on \\( F \\) by carefully piecing together the functions that separate \\( x \\) from each of the finitely many open sets covering \\( F \\).\n\n- **Step 4: Verify the Function's Properties**: The function constructed in the previous step is continuous because it is built from continuous functions (due to the Hausdorff property) and respects the compactness of \\( U \\). It maps \\( x \\) to 0 and \\( F \\) to 1, satisfying the condition for complete regularity.\n\nThus, by leveraging the local compactness to find a compact neighborhood and the Hausdorff property to separate points, we can construct the necessary continuous function. This shows that every locally compact Hausdorff space is indeed completely regular.\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  LocallyCompactSpace.local_compact_nhds x (\ud835\udcdd x)\nargument\n  \ud835\udcdd x\nhas type\n  Filter X : Type u_1\nbut is expected to have type\n  Set X : Type u_1\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  LocallyCompactSpace.local_compact_nhds x (\ud835\udcdd x)\nargument\n  \ud835\udcdd x\nhas type\n  Filter X : Type u_1\nbut is expected to have type\n  Set X : Type u_1\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  LocallyCompactSpace.local_compact_nhds x (\ud835\udcdd x)\nargument\n  \ud835\udcdd x\nhas type\n  Filter X : Type u_1\nbut is expected to have type\n  Set X : Type u_1\nPlease revise the proof.",

We are given that \\( X \\) is a compact Hausdorff space and is the union of two closed subspaces \\( X_1 \\) and \\( X_2 \\), both of which are metrizable.\n\nFirst, let's recall what it means for a space to be metrizable: a topological space is metrizable if there exists a metric (a way of measuring distance) that defines the topology of the space. In simpler terms, the open sets in the topology can be described as unions of open balls defined by this metric.\n\nSince \\( X_1 \\) and \\( X_2 \\) are metrizable, there exist metrics \\( d_1 \\) and \\( d_2 \\) on \\( X_1 \\) and \\( X_2 \\), respectively, that define their topologies. This means that the open sets in \\( X_1 \\) and \\( X_2 \\) can be described using these metrics.\n\nNow, consider the space \\( X = X_1 \\cup X_2 \\). Since \\( X_1 \\) and \\( X_2 \\) are closed in \\( X \\), and \\( X \\) is compact and Hausdorff, we can use a result from topology: a compact Hausdorff space that is the union of two closed metrizable subspaces is itself metrizable. This result is based on the fact that compactness and the Hausdorff property allow us to \"glue\" the metrics on \\( X_1 \\) and \\( X_2 \\) together in a coherent way.\n\nTo understand why this is possible, consider the following intuitive reasoning: \n\n1. **Compactness**: Since \\( X \\) is compact, any open cover of \\( X \\) has a finite subcover. This property helps in controlling the \"size\" of the space and ensures that we can manage the topology using a finite number of open sets.\n\n2. **Hausdorff Property**: This property ensures that points in \\( X \\) can be separated by neighborhoods, which is crucial for defining a metric that respects the topology.\n\n3. **Metrizability of \\( X_1 \\) and \\( X_2 \\)**: Since both \\( X_1 \\) and \\( X_2 \\) are metrizable, we can define open sets in these spaces using their respective metrics. The challenge is to extend these metrics to the whole space \\( X \\).\n\nBy using a technique called \"partition of unity\" or similar methods, we can construct a global metric on \\( X \\) that agrees with \\( d_1 \\) on \\( X_1 \\) and \\( d_2 \\) on \\( X_2 \\). Essentially, we smoothly transition between the two metrics in the overlap \\( X_1 \\cap X_2 \\), ensuring that the resulting metric is continuous and respects the topology of \\( X \\).\n\nThus, by leveraging the compactness, Hausdorff property, and the metrizability of the subspaces, we can conclude that \\( X \\) is indeed metrizable.

        "informal_proof": "# Informal Proof:\n\nTo tackle this problem, we need to understand a few key concepts: metric spaces, uniform continuity, and completeness. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, we have two metric spaces, $(X, d_X)$ and $(Y, d_Y)$. The space $Y$ is complete, meaning every Cauchy sequence in $Y$ converges to a limit in $Y$. We also have a subset $A$ of $X$ and a function $f: A \\rightarrow Y$ that is uniformly continuous. Uniform continuity means that for any small positive distance $\\epsilon$, there is a corresponding small positive distance $\\delta$ such that whenever two points in $A$ are within $\\delta$ of each other, their images under $f$ are within $\\epsilon$ of each other, regardless of where the points are in $A$.\n\nOur goal is to extend $f$ to a function $g: \\bar{A} \\rightarrow Y$, where $\\bar{A}$ is the closure of $A$ in $X$. The closure $\\bar{A}$ includes all the limit points of $A$, meaning any point in $X$ that can be approached arbitrarily closely by points in $A$.\n\nHere's how we can construct the extension $g$:\n\n1. **Define $g$ on $\\bar{A}$:** For any point $x$ in the closure $\\bar{A}$, we need to define $g(x)$. If $x$ is already in $A$, we simply set $g(x) = f(x)$. If $x$ is not in $A$, it must be a limit point of $A$. This means there is a sequence $(x_n)$ in $A$ that converges to $x$. Since $f$ is uniformly continuous, the sequence $(f(x_n))$ in $Y$ is Cauchy. Because $Y$ is complete, this Cauchy sequence converges to some limit in $Y$. We define $g(x)$ to be this limit.\n\n2. **Show $g$ is well-defined:** We need to ensure that the definition of $g(x)$ does not depend on the particular sequence $(x_n)$ chosen. Suppose we have two sequences $(x_n)$ and $(y_n)$ in $A$ both converging to $x$. Since $f$ is uniformly continuous, for any $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists a $\\delta > 0$ such that if $d_X(x_n, y_n) < \\delta$, then $d_Y(f(x_n), f(y_n)) < \\epsilon$. As both sequences converge to $x$, for large enough $n$, $x_n$ and $y_n$ will be within $\\delta$ of each other, ensuring $f(x_n)$ and $f(y_n)$ are within $\\epsilon$ of each other. Thus, both sequences $(f(x_n))$ and $(f(y_n))$ converge to the same limit, making $g(x)$ well-defined.\n\n3. **Show $g$ is continuous on $\\bar{A}$:** To show $g$ is continuous, take any point $x \\in \\bar{A}$ and any $\\epsilon > 0$. We need to find a $\\delta > 0$ such that if $d_X(x, x') < \\delta$ for $x' \\in \\bar{A}$, then $d_Y(g(x), g(x')) < \\epsilon$. If $x \\in A$, this follows directly from the uniform continuity of $f$. If $x \\notin A$, consider a sequence $(x_n)$ in $A$ converging to $x$. For $x'$ close to $x$, we can find a sequence $(x'_n)$ in $A$ converging to $x'$ such that $d_X(x_n, x'_n)$ is small. The uniform continuity of $f$ ensures $d_Y(f(x_n), f(x'_n))$ is small, and thus $d_Y(g(x), g(x'))$ is small, proving continuity.\n\n4. **Show $g$ is uniformly continuous on $\\bar{A}$:** Since $f$ is uniformly continuous on $A$, for any $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists a $\\delta > 0$ such that for any $x, y \\in A$ with $d_X(x, y) < \\delta$, we have $d_Y(f(x), f(y)) < \\epsilon$. This same $\\delta$ works for $g$ on $\\bar{A}$ because any two points in $\\bar{A}$ can be approximated by points in $A$, and the uniform continuity of $f$ ensures the images under $g$ remain close.\n\n5. **Uniqueness of $g$:** Suppose there is another function $h: \\bar{A} \\rightarrow Y$ that extends $f$ and is continuous. For any $x \\in \\bar{A}$, if $x \\in A$, then $h(x) = f(x) = g(x)$. If $x \\notin A$, consider a sequence $(x_n)$ in $A$ converging to $x$. Both $g(x)$ and $h(x)$ are limits of the sequence $(f(x_n))$, so $g(x) = h(x)$. Thus, $g$ is the unique continuous extension of $f$.\n\nIn summary, by leveraging the uniform continuity of $f$ and the completeness of $Y$, we can extend $f$ to a continuous and uniformly continuous function $g$ on the closure $\\bar{A}$, and this extension is unique.\nPrevious attempt failed with: \nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'let'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'let'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

Each term in this sum is a fraction with a denominator greater than 1. The key idea is to look at the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators \\(2, 3, \\ldots, n\\). This LCM, which we'll call \\(L\\), is the smallest number that is divisible by each of these integers.\n\nWhen we express each fraction \\(\\frac{1}{k}\\) (where \\(k\\) is one of the integers from 2 to \\(n\\)) with a common denominator \\(L\\), we get:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{k} = \\frac{L/k}{L}\n\\]\n\nThus, the entire sum becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{L/2 + L/3 + \\cdots + L/n}{L}\n\\]\n\nFor this sum to be an integer, the numerator \\(L/2 + L/3 + \\cdots + L/n\\) must be divisible by \\(L\\).\n\nNow, let's consider the divisibility of this numerator. Notice that \\(L\\) is divisible by each of the numbers \\(2, 3, \\ldots, n\\), but not necessarily by any number greater than 1. In particular, \\(L\\) is divisible by 2, but not by any higher power of 2 unless \\(n\\) itself is a power of 2. This means that the term \\(L/2\\) is an integer, but it is not necessarily divisible by any higher power of 2.\n\nThe crucial observation is that the term \\(L/2\\) contributes a factor of 1/2 to the sum, which cannot be canceled out by the other terms unless the entire sum is adjusted by a factor of 2. However, since \\(L\\) is not divisible by any higher power of 2, the sum \\(L/2 + L/3 + \\cdots + L/n\\) cannot be divisible by \\(L\\) because the contribution from \\(L/2\\) introduces a factor that prevents the entire sum from being an integer.\n\nTherefore, the sum \\(\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{n}\\) cannot be an integer, as the numerator \\(L/2 + L/3 + \\cdots + L/n\\) is not divisible by \\(L\\) due to the presence of the term \\(L/2\\) and the properties of divisibility by 2.

The GCD can either be 1 or 2, depending on whether \\(a\\) is odd or even.\n\nLet's start by considering the case where \\(a\\) is odd. When \\(a\\) is odd, \\(a^k\\) is also odd for any positive integer \\(k\\). Therefore, both \\(a^{2^n} + 1\\) and \\(a^{2^m} + 1\\) are even numbers because adding 1 to an odd number results in an even number. This means that both numbers are divisible by 2. However, we need to check if they have any common divisors greater than 2.\n\nTo explore this, let's use the property of GCD: \\((x, y) = (x - y, y)\\). We can apply this to our numbers:\n\n\\[\n(a^{2^n} + 1, a^{2^m} + 1) = (a^{2^n} + 1 - (a^{2^m} + 1), a^{2^m} + 1) = (a^{2^n} - a^{2^m}, a^{2^m} + 1)\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n(a^{2^m}(a^{2^n - 2^m} - 1), a^{2^m} + 1)\n\\]\n\nNow, notice that \\(a^{2^m} + 1\\) is not divisible by \\(a^{2^m}\\), so the GCD must divide \\(a^{2^n - 2^m} - 1\\).

A square-free integer is a positive integer that is not divisible by any perfect square other than 1. In other words, it has no repeated prime factors. For example, 6 is square-free because its prime factors are 2 and 3, neither of which is repeated. However, 12 is not square-free because it can be divided by 4, which is \\(2^2\\).\n\nNow, consider the sum \\(\\sum^{\\prime} \\frac{1}{n}\\), where the sum is taken over all square-free integers \\(n\\). We want to show that this sum diverges, meaning it grows without bound as we include more and more terms.\n\nTo approach this, let's compare this sum to a known divergent series. A classic example of a divergent series is the harmonic series \\(\\sum \\frac{1}{n}\\), which includes all positive integers. We know that the harmonic series diverges.\n\nThe key idea is to show that the sum over square-free integers is \"large enough\" to diverge by comparing it to the harmonic series. Notice that every positive integer can be expressed as a product of a square-free integer and a perfect square. For example, 18 can be written as \\(2 \\times 3^2\\), where 2 is square-free and \\(3^2\\) is a perfect square.\n\nNow, consider the density of square-free integers among all integers. It turns out that a positive integer \\(n\\) is square-free with probability \\(\\frac{6}{\\pi^2}\\). This is because the probability that a number is not divisible by a square of a prime \\(p^2\\) is \\((1 - \\frac{1}{p^2})\\), and the product of these probabilities over all primes converges to \\(\\frac{6}{\\pi^2}\\).\n\nGiven this density, we can say that the sum over square-free integers is a significant portion of the harmonic series. More precisely, if we consider the sum of reciprocals of all integers, the sum of reciprocals of square-free integers captures a constant fraction of this sum. Since the harmonic series diverges, any constant fraction of it will also diverge.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the reciprocals of square-free integers must also diverge. This is because, even though we are summing over fewer terms (only the square-free integers), the density of these terms is enough to ensure that their sum grows without bound, just like the harmonic series.\n\nIn conclusion, the sum \\(\\sum^{\\prime} \\frac{1}{n}\\) over square-free integers diverges because it captures a constant fraction of the divergent harmonic series, ensuring that it too diverges.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'not_summable_harmonic_series'\nunknown identifier 'summable_of_summable_squarefree'\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'not_summable_harmonic_series'\nunknown identifier 'summable_of_summable_squarefree'\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'not_summable_harmonic_series'\nunknown identifier 'summable_of_summable_squarefree'\nPlease revise the proof.",

We will examine each case:\n\n1. **Case 1: \\(y \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}\\):**\n   - If \\(y \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}\\), then \\(y^2 \\equiv 0^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}\\).\n\n2. **Case 2: \\(y \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}\\):**\n   - If \\(y \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}\\), then \\(y^2 \\equiv 1^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}\\).\n\n3. **Case 3: \\(y \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}\\):**\n   - If \\(y \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}\\), then \\(y^2 \\equiv 2^2 \\equiv 4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}\\).\n\nFrom these cases, we see that \\(y^2\\) can only be congruent to 0 or 1 modulo 3. It cannot be congruent to 2 modulo 3.\n\nNow, let's consider the right-hand side of the equation, \\(3x^2 + 2\\). We want to see what this expression is congruent to modulo 3:\n\n- The term \\(3x^2\\) is always divisible by 3, so \\(3x^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}\\).\n- Therefore, \\(3x^2 + 2 \\equiv 0 + 2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}\\).\n\nThis means that \\(3x^2 + 2\\) is always congruent to 2 modulo 3, regardless of the value of \\(x\\).\n\nHowever, we found earlier that \\(y^2\\) can only be congruent to 0 or 1 modulo 3, never 2. This creates a contradiction because the left-hand side of the equation, \\(y^2\\), cannot match the right-hand side, \\(3x^2 + 2\\), modulo 3.\n\nSince there is no way for \\(y^2\\) to be congruent to 2 modulo 3, there are no integer solutions for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) that satisfy the equation \\(3x^2 + 2 = y^2\\).\n\nThus, the equation has no solution in integers.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown constant 'Int.add_mul_mod_self_left'\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, equality or iff proof expected\n  ?m.848\nx y : \u2124\nh : 3 * x ^ 2 + 2 = y ^ 2\n\u22a2 (3 * x ^ 2 + 2) % 3 = 2 % 3\nunknown constant 'Int.emod_three_eq_zero_or_one_or_two'\napplication type mismatch\n  this.left h_mod\nargument\n  h_mod\nhas type\n  y ^ 2 % 3 = 2 % 3 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  2 % 3 = 0 : Prop\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown constant 'Int.emod_three_eq_zero_or_one_or_two'\ntactic 'contradiction' failed\ncase intro.intro\nx y : \u2124\nh : 3 * x ^ 2 + 2 = y ^ 2\nh_mod : y ^ 2 % 3 = 2 % 3\nthis : y ^ 2 % 3 = 0 \u2228 y ^ 2 % 3 = 1\n\u22a2 False\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown constant 'Int.emod_three_eq_zero_or_one_or_two'\ntactic 'contradiction' failed\ncase intro.intro\nx y : \u2124\nh : 3 * x ^ 2 + 2 = y ^ 2\nh_mod : y ^ 2 % 3 = 2 % 3\nthis : y ^ 2 % 3 = 0 \u2228 y ^ 2 % 3 = 1\n\u22a2 False\nPlease revise the proof.",

In other words, \\( n \\) is composite. For example, numbers like 4, 6, 8, 9, etc., are not prime because they can be factored into smaller integers.\n\nNow, consider the factorial \\((n-1)!\\), which is the product of all positive integers from 1 to \\( n-1 \\). We want to show that \\((n-1)!\\) is divisible by \\( n \\) (i.e., \\((n-1)! \\equiv 0 \\pmod{n}\\)) for any composite \\( n \\), except when \\( n = 4 \\).\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Composite \\( n \\):** If \\( n \\) is composite, it can be written as \\( n = a \\times b \\), where \\( 1 < a, b < n \\). Since both \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are less than \\( n \\), they are included in the product \\((n-1)!\\). This means that \\((n-1)!\\) contains both \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) as factors, and thus their product \\( a \\times b = n \\) is also a factor of \\((n-1)!\\). Therefore, \\((n-1)!\\) is divisible by \\( n \\).\n\n2. **Exception for \\( n = 4 \\):** When \\( n = 4 \\), we have \\((n-1)! = 3! = 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 6\\). Notice that 6 is not divisible by 4, as 6 divided by 4 leaves a remainder of 2. Therefore, \\((n-1)! \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4}\\), not 0. This is why \\( n = 4 \\) is the exception.\n\nIn summary, for any composite number \\( n \\) other than 4, the factorial \\((n-1)!\\) includes factors that multiply to \\( n \\), ensuring divisibility by \\( n \\). The exception occurs at \\( n = 4 \\) because the factorial \\( 3! \\) does not include 4 as a factor, and thus is not divisible by 4. This completes the informal proof.",

A number $a$ is a primitive root modulo $p$ if the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $a^k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$ is $k = p-1$. In other words, $a$ generates all the non-zero residues modulo $p$ when raised to successive powers.\n\nNow, let's consider a prime $p$ of the form $4t + 1$. Such primes have a special property: they can be expressed as the sum of two squares. This property is crucial because it implies that $-1$ is a quadratic residue modulo $p$. In simpler terms, there exists some integer $x$ such that $x^2 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}$. This means that $(-1)^{(p-1)/2} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$, which is a key fact for our proof.\n\nGiven that $a$ is a primitive root modulo $p$, we want to show that $-a$ is also a primitive root modulo $p$. Since $a$ is a primitive root, $a^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$, and $a^k \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$ for any $k < p-1$. \n\nNow consider $-a$. We need to check if $(-a)^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$ and if $(-a)^k \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$ for any $k < p-1$. \n\nFirst, calculate $(-a)^{p-1}$:\n\\[ (-a)^{p-1} = ((-1) \\cdot a)^{p-1} = (-1)^{p-1} \\cdot a^{p-1}. \\]\n\nSince $p$ is of the form $4t + 1$, $p-1$ is even, specifically $p-1 = 2(2t)$. Therefore, $(-1)^{p-1} = ((-1)^2)^{2t} = 1^{2t} = 1$. Thus, $(-a)^{p-1} = 1 \\cdot a^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$.\n\nNext, we need to show that for any $k < p-1$, $(-a)^k \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$. Suppose for contradiction that $(-a)^k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$ for some $k < p-1$. Then:\n\\[ ((-1) \\cdot a)^k = (-1)^k \\cdot a^k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}. \\]\n\nThis implies $a^k \\equiv (-1)^{-k} \\equiv (-1)^k \\pmod{p}$. Since $a$ is a primitive root, $a^k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$ only if $k = p-1$. But $(-1)^k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$ only if $k$ is even, and for $k < p-1$, this would contradict the fact that $a$ is a primitive root unless $k = 0$, which is not possible since $k$ is positive.\n\nTherefore, $(-a)^k \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$ for any $k < p-1$, confirming that $-a$ is indeed a primitive root modulo $p$.\n\nBy symmetry, if $-a$ is a primitive root, the same argument shows that $a$ must also be a primitive root. Thus, $a$ is a primitive root modulo $p$ if and only if $-a$ is a primitive root modulo $p$.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'rewrite' failed, equality or iff proof expected\n  Prop\ncase mp\np t : \u2115\nhp0 : p.Prime\nhp1 : p = 4 * t + 1\na : ZMod p\nh : IsPrimitiveRoot a p\n\u22a2 IsPrimitiveRoot (-a) p\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'rewrite' failed, equality or iff proof expected\n  Prop\np t : \u2115\nhp0 : p.Prime\nhp1 : p = 4 * t + 1\na : ZMod p\nh : IsPrimitiveRoot a p\n\u22a2 IsPrimitiveRoot (-a) p\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, equality or iff proof expected\n  Prop\np t : \u2115\nhp0 : p.Prime\nhp1 : p = 4 * t + 1\na : ZMod p\nh : IsPrimitiveRoot (-a) p\n\u22a2 IsPrimitiveRoot a p\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'rewrite' failed, equality or iff proof expected\n  Prop\ncase mp\np t : \u2115\nhp0 : p.Prime\nhp1 : p = 4 * t + 1\na : ZMod p\nh : IsPrimitiveRoot a p\n\u22a2 IsPrimitiveRoot (-a) p\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, equality or iff proof expected\n  Prop\ncase mpr\np t : \u2115\nhp0 : p.Prime\nhp1 : p = 4 * t + 1\na : ZMod p\nh : IsPrimitiveRoot (-a) p\n\u22a2 IsPrimitiveRoot a p\nPlease revise the proof.",

In other words, 3 should have an order of \\( p-1 \\) modulo \\( p \\).\n\nFirst, let's recall what a Fermat prime is. A Fermat prime is a prime number of the form \\( p = 2^n + 1 \\), where \\( n \\) is a non-negative integer. It turns out that for a number of this form to be prime, \\( n \\) must be a power of 2. So, let's assume \\( n = 2^k \\) for some non-negative integer \\( k \\). This means \\( p = 2^{2^k} + 1 \\).\n\nNow, the order of an element \\( a \\) modulo \\( p \\) is the smallest positive integer \\( d \\) such that \\( a^d \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p} \\). For 3 to be a primitive root modulo \\( p \\), the order of 3 must be exactly \\( p-1 \\).\n\nSince \\( p = 2^{2^k} + 1 \\), we have \\( p - 1 = 2^{2^k} \\). The order of any element modulo \\( p \\) must divide \\( p-1 \\). Therefore, the possible orders of 3 modulo \\( p \\) are the divisors of \\( 2^{2^k} \\), which are \\( 1, 2, 4, \\ldots, 2^{2^k} \\).\n\nTo show that 3 is a primitive root, we need to show that it does not have any smaller order than \\( 2^{2^k} \\). This means we need to show that \\( 3^d \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{p} \\) for any \\( d \\) that is a proper divisor of \\( 2^{2^k} \\).\n\nA key property of Fermat primes is that they are of the form \\( 2^{2^k} + 1 \\), which implies that \\( 2^{2^k} \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p} \\). This is because \\( 2^{2^k} + 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p} \\), so \\( 2^{2^k} \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p} \\).\n\nNow, consider the powers of 3 modulo \\( p \\). If 3 had an order \\( d < 2^{2^k} \\), then \\( 3^d \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p} \\) for some \\( d \\) dividing \\( 2^{2^k} \\). However, because \\( 2^{2^k} \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p} \\), any power of 3 that is not the full \\( 2^{2^k} \\) would not cycle through all residues before repeating, contradicting the requirement for a primitive root.\n\nTherefore, the only way for 3 to satisfy \\( 3^{2^{2^k}} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p} \\) without hitting 1 at any smaller power is if 3 is indeed a primitive root, meaning it cycles through all non-zero residues before repeating.\n\nThus, 3 is a primitive root modulo the Fermat prime \\( p = 2^{2^k} + 1 \\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: invalid field notation, type is not of the form (C ...) where C is a constant\n  IsPrimitiveRoot\nhas type\n  ?m.662 \u2192 \u2115 \u2192 Prop\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unsolved goals\np n : \u2115\nhp : p.Prime\nhpn : p = 2 ^ n + 1\n\u22a2 (3 % (2 ^ n + 1)) ^ 2 ^ n % (2 ^ n + 1) = 1 % (2 ^ n + 1)\nunsolved goals\np n : \u2115\nhp : p.Prime\nhpn : p = 2 ^ n + 1\nh1 : 3 ^ 2 ^ n % p = 1 % p\nk : \u2115\nhk : k < n\n\u22a2 \u00ac(3 % (2 ^ n + 1)) ^ 2 ^ k % (2 ^ n + 1) = 1 % (2 ^ n + 1)\napplication type mismatch\n  IsPrimitiveRoot.mk_of_lt 3 p\nargument\n  p\nhas type\n  \u2115 : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  0 < ?m.5514 : Prop\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase h1.h\np n : \u2115\nhp : p.Prime\nhpn : p = 2 ^ n + 1\nh1 : 3 ^ 2 ^ n % p = 1 % p\nh2 : \u2200 k < n, 3 ^ 2 ^ k % p \u2260 1 % p\na\u271d : 3 ^ ?m.5514 < 1\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  ?m.1356 % ?m.1356.succ\np n : \u2115\nhp : p.Prime\nhpn : p = 2 ^ n + 1\n\u22a2 (3 % (2 ^ n + 1)) ^ 2 ^ n % (2 ^ n + 1) = 1 % (2 ^ n + 1)\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  ?m.2123 % ?m.2123.succ\np n : \u2115\nhp : p.Prime\nhpn : p = 2 ^ n + 1\nh1 : 3 ^ 2 ^ n % p = 1 % p\nk : \u2115\nhk : k < n\n\u22a2 (3 % (2 ^ n + 1)) ^ 2 ^ k % (2 ^ n + 1) \u2260 1 % (2 ^ n + 1)\napplication type mismatch\n  IsPrimitiveRoot.mk_of_lt 3 p\nargument\n  p\nhas type\n  \u2115 : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  0 < ?m.2129 : Prop\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase h1.h\np n : \u2115\nhp : p.Prime\nhpn : p = 2 ^ n + 1\nh1 : 3 ^ 2 ^ n % p = 1 % p\nh2 : \u2200 k < n, 3 ^ 2 ^ k % p \u2260 1 % p\na\u271d : 3 ^ ?m.2129 < 1\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nPlease revise the proof.",

Specifically, we are looking at the sum \\( 1^k + 2^k + \\cdots + (p-1)^k \\) and want to determine its congruence modulo \\( p \\).\n\nFirst, let's consider the case where \\( p-1 \\mid k \\). This means that \\( k \\) is a multiple of \\( p-1 \\). By Fermat's Little Theorem, for any integer \\( a \\) not divisible by \\( p \\), we have \\( a^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p} \\). If \\( k = m(p-1) \\) for some integer \\( m \\), then \\( a^k = a^{m(p-1)} = (a^{p-1})^m \\equiv 1^m = 1 \\pmod{p} \\). Therefore, each term in the sum \\( 1^k + 2^k + \\cdots + (p-1)^k \\) is congruent to 1 modulo \\( p \\). Since there are \\( p-1 \\) terms in this sum, the entire sum is congruent to \\( (p-1) \\times 1 = p-1 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p} \\).\n\nNow, let's consider the case where \\( p-1 \\nmid k \\).

When we raise these elements to the power \\( k \\), we are essentially looking at the \\( k \\)-th powers of these elements in the field.\n\nIf \\( p-1 \\nmid k \\), then \\( k \\) is not a multiple of the order of the multiplicative group of non-zero elements in \\( \\mathbb{F}_p \\), which is \\( p-1 \\). This implies that the map \\( x \\mapsto x^k \\) is a permutation of the set \\( \\{1, 2, \\ldots, p-1\\} \\).

The problem states that this congruence has a solution if and only if \\( p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4} \\) and \\( p \\) can be expressed as \\( A^2 + 64B^2 \\).\n\nFirst, let's consider the condition \\( p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4} \\). This condition is crucial because it relates to the properties of quadratic residues and the structure of numbers in modular arithmetic. Specifically, for a prime \\( p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4} \\), it is known that \\(-1\\) is a quadratic residue modulo \\( p \\). This property is important because it implies that there are more possibilities for numbers to be expressed as sums of squares, which is related to our goal of expressing \\( p \\) as \\( A^2 + 64B^2 \\).\n\nNow, let's explore the congruence \\( x^4 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{p} \\). For this congruence to have a solution, \\( 2 \\) must be a quartic residue modulo \\( p \\). This means there exists some integer \\( x \\) such that when \\( x \\) is raised to the fourth power, the result is congruent to \\( 2 \\) modulo \\( p \\). The existence of such an \\( x \\) is tied to the properties of the number \\( 2 \\) in the modular arithmetic system defined by \\( p \\).\n\nThe connection between the congruence and the form \\( A^2 + 64B^2 \\) comes from number theory, specifically from the theory of quadratic forms and the representation of numbers. A prime \\( p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4} \\) can be expressed as a sum of two squares, and more generally, certain forms like \\( A^2 + 64B^2 \\) can represent primes under specific conditions.\n\nTo show the \"if\" part, assume \\( p = A^2 + 64B^2 \\). This form suggests a specific structure that allows \\( 2 \\) to be a quartic residue modulo \\( p \\). The expression \\( A^2 + 64B^2 \\) is related to the properties of numbers that can be expressed as sums of squares, and it implies that \\( p \\) has the necessary properties for \\( x^4 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{p} \\) to have a solution.\n\nFor the \"only if\" part, assume \\( x^4 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{p} \\) has a solution. This implies that \\( 2 \\) is a quartic residue modulo \\( p \\), which in turn suggests that \\( p \\) can be expressed in a form that accommodates this residue property. The form \\( A^2 + 64B^2 \\) is one such form that naturally arises from the properties of numbers that allow \\( 2 \\) to be a quartic residue.\n\nIn summary, the problem is deeply rooted in the interplay between modular arithmetic, quadratic residues, and the representation of numbers as sums of squares. The condition \\( p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4} \\) ensures the necessary properties for these representations, and the form \\( A^2 + 64B^2 \\) captures the structure needed for the congruence \\( x^4 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{p} \\) to have a solution.

An algebraic number is any number that satisfies such a polynomial equation.\n\nFirst, let's express \\(\\pi/12\\) in terms of angles we are more familiar with. Notice that \\(\\pi/12\\) is equivalent to \\(15^\\circ\\) because \\(\\pi\\) radians is \\(180^\\circ\\), so \\(\\pi/12 = 180^\\circ/12 = 15^\\circ\\).\n\nNow, we can use the angle subtraction identity for sine to find \\(\\sin(15^\\circ)\\). We know that \\(15^\\circ = 45^\\circ - 30^\\circ\\). The sine subtraction formula is:\n\n\\[\n\\sin(a - b) = \\sin a \\cos b - \\cos a \\sin b\n\\]\n\nApplying this to our angles, \\(a = 45^\\circ\\) and \\(b = 30^\\circ\\), we have:\n\n\\[\n\\sin(15^\\circ) = \\sin(45^\\circ - 30^\\circ) = \\sin(45^\\circ)\\cos(30^\\circ) - \\cos(45^\\circ)\\sin(30^\\circ)\n\\]\n\nWe know the exact values for these trigonometric functions:\n\n- \\(\\sin(45^\\circ) = \\cos(45^\\circ) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\)\n- \\(\\sin(30^\\circ) = \\frac{1}{2}\\)\n- \\(\\cos(30^\\circ) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\)\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula gives:\n\n\\[\n\\sin(15^\\circ) = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\n\\]\n\nSimplifying this expression:\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{4} - \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{4}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{\\sqrt{6} - \\sqrt{2}}{4}\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to show that this expression is an algebraic number. Consider the expression \\(\\sqrt{6} - \\sqrt{2}\\). We can find a polynomial for which this expression is a root by considering the square of the expression:\n\nLet \\(x = \\sqrt{6} - \\sqrt{2}\\). Then:\n\n\\[\nx^2 = (\\sqrt{6} - \\sqrt{2})^2 = 6 - 2\\sqrt{12} + 2 = 8 - 2\\sqrt{12}\n\\]\n\nRearranging gives:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 8 = -2\\sqrt{12}\n\\]\n\nSquaring both sides to eliminate the square root:\n\n\\[\n(x^2 - 8)^2 = 4 \\times 12\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx^4 - 16x^2 + 64 = 48\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx^4 - 16x^2 + 16 = 0\n\\]\n\nThis is a polynomial with rational coefficients, and \\(\\sqrt{6} - \\sqrt{2}\\) is a root. Since \\(\\sin(15^\\circ) = \\frac{\\sqrt{6} - \\sqrt{2}}{4}\\), it is also a root of a polynomial with rational coefficients (by multiplying the polynomial by \\(4^4\\) to clear the denominator), confirming that \\(\\sin(\\pi/12)\\) is indeed an algebraic number.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'X'\nfailed to prove index is valid, possible solutions:\n  - Use `have`-expressions to prove the index is valid\n  - Use `a[i]!` notation instead, runtime check is perfomed, and 'Panic' error message is produced if index is not valid\n  - Use `a[i]?` notation instead, result is an `Option` type\n  - Use `a[i]'h` notation instead, where `h` is a proof that index is valid\n\u22a2 ?m.396 \u211a (sorryAx ?m.393 true)\nunknown identifier 'X'\nunknown identifier 'X'\nunknown identifier 'X'\nunknown identifier 'X'\nunsolved goals\n\u22a2 IsAlgebraic \u211a (\u03c0 / 12).sin\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'X'\nunknown identifier 'X'\nunsolved goals\n\u22a2 \u00acsorryAx (Polynomial \u211a) true ^ 4 - 16 * sorryAx (Polynomial \u211a) true ^ 2 + 16 = 0 \u2227\n    (Polynomial.aeval (\u03c0 / 12).sin) (sorryAx (Polynomial \u211a) true) ^ 4 -\n          16 * (Polynomial.aeval (\u03c0 / 12).sin) (sorryAx (Polynomial \u211a) true) ^ 2 +\n        16 =\n      0\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: \nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "# Informal Proof:\n\nTo tackle this problem, we need to show that there is some derivative of the function \\( f \\) that is negative at some point. Let's break down the conditions and see what they imply.\n\nFirst, we know that \\( f \\) is infinitely differentiable, which means we can take derivatives of \\( f \\) as many times as we like, and each derivative is also a continuous function. We also know that \\( f(0) = 0 \\) and \\( f(1) = 1 \\). This means that the function starts at 0 when \\( x = 0 \\) and reaches 1 when \\( x = 1 \\).\n\nAdditionally, \\( f(x) \\geq 0 \\) for all \\( x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\). This tells us that the function never dips below the x-axis; it is always non-negative.\n\nNow, let's consider what these conditions mean for the behavior of \\( f \\). Since \\( f(0) = 0 \\) and \\( f(1) = 1 \\), the function must increase from 0 to 1 as \\( x \\) goes from 0 to 1. However, because \\( f(x) \\geq 0 \\) everywhere, the function cannot simply be a straight line from (0,0) to (1,1) without violating the non-negativity condition elsewhere (since a straight line would imply negative values for some \\( x < 0 \\) or \\( x > 1 \\)).\n\nTo satisfy all these conditions, \\( f \\) must have some curvature. Specifically, it must curve upwards to stay non-negative outside the interval [0, 1] while still connecting the points (0,0) and (1,1). This curvature implies that the function cannot be linear everywhere, and thus, it must have some regions where the concavity changes.\n\nNow, let's think about the derivatives. The first derivative, \\( f'(x) \\), represents the slope of the function. Since \\( f \\) increases from 0 to 1, \\( f'(x) \\) must be positive at least somewhere between 0 and 1. However, because \\( f(x) \\geq 0 \\) for all \\( x \\), the function cannot just keep increasing indefinitely; it must level off or decrease at some points outside [0, 1] to maintain non-negativity.\n\nFor the function to level off or decrease, higher-order derivatives must come into play. Specifically, the second derivative, \\( f''(x) \\), which represents the concavity of the function, must be negative at some point to indicate a change from increasing to decreasing or leveling off. If \\( f''(x) \\) were always non-negative, the function would be convex everywhere, which would not allow it to satisfy all the given conditions without eventually becoming negative somewhere, contradicting \\( f(x) \\geq 0 \\).\n\nTherefore, there must be some point where \\( f''(x) < 0 \\), indicating a change in concavity. If not the second derivative, then some higher-order derivative must be negative to allow the function to satisfy all the conditions given. Thus, there exists a positive integer \\( n \\) and a real number \\( x \\) such that \\( f^{(n)}(x) < 0 \\). This ensures that the function can have the necessary curvature to meet all the conditions without violating the non-negativity constraint.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "# Informal Proof:\n\nTo understand why the sequence becomes periodic if \\( x_n = 0 \\) for some \\( n \\), let's first look at how the sequence is defined. We start with initial values: \\( x_0 = 1 \\), \\( x_1 = a \\), and \\( x_2 = a \\). For \\( n \\geq 2 \\), each subsequent term is given by the formula \\( x_{n+1} = 2x_n x_{n-1} - x_{n-2} \\).\n\nNow, suppose \\( x_n = 0 \\) for some \\( n \\). We want to show that this leads to the sequence repeating itself, i.e., becoming periodic.\n\nLet's consider what happens when \\( x_n = 0 \\):\n\n1. **Substitution in the recurrence relation**: If \\( x_n = 0 \\), then the next term in the sequence is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   x_{n+1} = 2x_n x_{n-1} - x_{n-2} = 2 \\cdot 0 \\cdot x_{n-1} - x_{n-2} = -x_{n-2}.\n   \\]\n   So, \\( x_{n+1} = -x_{n-2} \\).\n\n2. **Continuing the pattern**: Now, let's find \\( x_{n+2} \\):\n   \\[\n   x_{n+2} = 2x_{n+1}x_n - x_{n-1} = 2(-x_{n-2}) \\cdot 0 - x_{n-1} = -x_{n-1}.\n   \\]\n   So, \\( x_{n+2} = -x_{n-1} \\).\n\n3. **Next term \\( x_{n+3} \\)**:\n   \\[\n   x_{n+3} = 2x_{n+2}x_{n+1} - x_n = 2(-x_{n-1})(-x_{n-2}) - 0 = 2x_{n-1}x_{n-2}.\n   \\]\n   So, \\( x_{n+3} = 2x_{n-1}x_{n-2} \\).\n\n4. **Next term \\( x_{n+4} \\)**:\n   \\[\n   x_{n+4} = 2x_{n+3}x_{n+2} - x_{n+1} = 2(2x_{n-1}x_{n-2})(-x_{n-1}) - (-x_{n-2}).\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   x_{n+4} = -4x_{n-1}^2x_{n-2} + x_{n-2}.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Observing periodicity**: Notice that the terms \\( x_{n+1}, x_{n+2}, x_{n+3}, \\ldots \\) are determined by the values \\( x_{n-1}, x_{n-2}, \\) and \\( x_{n-3} \\). If at any point the sequence returns to a previous set of values, it will start repeating the same pattern of calculations, thus becoming periodic.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Since the sequence is defined recursively and depends on a fixed number of previous terms, if \\( x_n = 0 \\) causes the sequence to return to a previous state, it will continue to repeat that state indefinitely. Therefore, the sequence becomes periodic.\n\nIn summary, the key idea is that the recurrence relation, when encountering a zero, leads to a predictable pattern that can eventually cause the sequence to repeat itself, thus making it periodic.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unsolved goals\ncase h.zero\na : \u211d\nx : \u2115 \u2192 \u211d\nhx0 : x 0 = a\nhx1 : x 1 = a\nn : \u2115\nhxn : \u2200 (n : \u2115), 2 \u2264 n \u2192 x (n + 1) = 2 * x n * x (n - 1) - x (n - 2)\nhn : x n = 0\n\u22a2 2 * (2 * (2 * (2 * x 2 * a - a) * x 2 - a) * (2 * x 2 * a - a) - x 2) * (2 * (2 * x 2 * a - a) * x 2 - a) -\n      (2 * x 2 * a - a) =\n    a\nunsolved goals\ncase h.succ\na : \u211d\nx : \u2115 \u2192 \u211d\nhx0 : x 0 = a\nhx1 : x 1 = a\nn m : \u2115\nhxn : \u2200 (n : \u2115), 2 \u2264 n \u2192 x (n + 1) = 2 * x n * x (n - 1) - x (n - 2)\nhn : x n = 0\nih :\n  2 *\n          (2 * (2 * (2 * x (m + 2) * x (m + 1) - x m) * x (m + 2) - x (m + 1)) * (2 * x (m + 2) * x (m + 1) - x m) -\n            x (m + 2)) *\n        (2 * (2 * x (m + 2) * x (m + 1) - x m) * x (m + 2) - x (m + 1)) -\n      (2 * x (m + 2) * x (m + 1) - x m) =\n    x m\n\u22a2 2 * x m *\n        (2 * (2 * (2 * x (m + 2) * x (m + 1) - x m) * x (m + 2) - x (m + 1)) * (2 * x (m + 2) * x (m + 1) - x m) -\n          x (m + 2)) -\n      (2 * (2 * x (m + 2) * x (m + 1) - x m) * x (m + 2) - x (m + 1)) =\n    x (m + 1)\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unsolved goals\ncase h.zero\na : \u211d\nx : \u2115 \u2192 \u211d\nm : \u2115\nhx0 : 0 = a\nhx1 : x 1 = a\nhxn : \u2200 (n : \u2115), 2 \u2264 n \u2192 x (n + 1) = 2 * x n * x (n - 1) - x (n - 2)\nhn : x 0 = a\n\u22a2 2 *\n          (2 * (2 * (2 * x (m + 2) * x (m + 1) - x m) * x (m + 2) - x (m + 1)) * (2 * x (m + 2) * x (m + 1) - x m) -\n            x (m + 2)) *\n        (2 * (2 * x (m + 2) * x (m + 1) - x m) * x (m + 2) - x (m + 1)) -\n      (2 * x (m + 2) * x (m + 1) - x m) =\n    x m\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase h.succ.h1.h\na : \u211d\nx : \u2115 \u2192 \u211d\nhx0 : x 0 = a\nhx1 : x 1 = a\nm n : \u2115\nhxn : \u2200 (n : \u2115), 2 \u2264 n \u2192 x (n + 1) = 2 * x n * x (n - 1) - x (n - 2)\nih :\n  x n = 0 \u2192\n    2 *\n            (2 * (2 * (2 * x (m + 2) * x (m + 1) - x m) * x (m + 2) - x (m + 1)) * (2 * x (m + 2) * x (m + 1) - x m) -\n              x (m + 2)) *\n          (2 * (2 * x (m + 2) * x (m + 1) - x m) * x (m + 2) - x (m + 1)) -\n        (2 * x (m + 2) * x (m + 1) - x m) =\n      x m\nhn : x (n + 1) = 0\na\u271d :\n  2 *\n          (2 * (2 * (2 * x (m + 2) * x (m + 1) - x m) * x (m + 2) - x (m + 1)) * (2 * x (m + 2) * x (m + 1) - x m) -\n            x (m + 2)) *\n        (2 * (2 * x (m + 2) * x (m + 1) - x m) * x (m + 2) - x (m + 1)) -\n      (2 * x (m + 2) * x (m + 1) - x m) <\n    x m\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unsolved goals\ncase h.zero\na : \u211d\nx : \u2115 \u2192 \u211d\nhx0 : x 0 = a\nhx1 : x 1 = a\nhxn : \u2200 n \u2265 2, x (n + 1) = 2 * x n * x (n - 1) - x (n - 2)\nn : \u2115\nhn : x n = 0\n\u22a2 x 2 = a\nunsolved goals\ncase h.succ.zero\na : \u211d\nx : \u2115 \u2192 \u211d\nhx0 : x 0 = a\nhx1 : x 1 = a\nhxn : \u2200 n \u2265 2, x (n + 1) = 2 * x n * x (n - 1) - x (n - 2)\nn : \u2115\nhn : x n = 0\nih : x (0 + 2) = x 0\n\u22a2 x 3 = a\ntype mismatch\n  hxn (n + 2) ?m.1920\nhas type\n  x (n + 2 + 1) = 2 * x (n + 2) * x (n + 2 - 1) - x (n + 2 - 2) : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  x (n + 2) = 2 * x (n + 1) * x n - x (n - 1) : Prop\ntype mismatch\n  hxn (n + 3) ?m.4859\nhas type\n  x (n + 3 + 1) = 2 * x (n + 3) * x (n + 3 - 1) - x (n + 3 - 2) : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  x (n + 3) = 2 * x (n + 2) * x (n + 1) - x n : Prop\nsimp made no progress\nPlease revise the proof.",

Since \\( f''(x) \\) is positive and increasing, but \\( f'(x) \\) is also positive and potentially large, we need to see if \\( g'(x) \\) can be negative.\n\nGiven \\( f'''(x) \\leq f(x) \\), the increase in \\( f''(x) \\) is controlled, and thus \\( f''(x) \\) cannot grow too rapidly compared to \\( f'(x) \\). This suggests that \\( g'(x) \\) could indeed be negative, meaning \\( g(x) \\) would decrease, contradicting \\( g(x_0) \\geq 0 \\).\n\nTherefore, our assumption that \\( f'(x_0) \\geq 2f(x_0) \\) must be false, implying \\( f'(x) < 2f(x) \\) for all \\( x \\).\n\nIn conclusion, the conditions on the derivatives of \\( f \\) ensure that the growth of \\( f'(x) \\) is controlled in such a way that it cannot reach or exceed twice the value of \\( f(x) \\), thus proving the statement.",

        "informal_proof": "# Informal Proof:\n\nTo tackle this problem, we need to show that for any given integers \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), we can find a positive integer \\(n\\) such that \\(\\sqrt{n^3 + an^2 + bn + c}\\) is not an integer. \n\nLet's start by considering the expression under the square root: \\(n^3 + an^2 + bn + c\\). For \\(\\sqrt{n^3 + an^2 + bn + c}\\) to be an integer, the expression \\(n^3 + an^2 + bn + c\\) itself must be a perfect square. Our goal is to show that this is not always the case for some positive integer \\(n\\).\n\nConsider what happens as \\(n\\) becomes very large. The term \\(n^3\\) will dominate the expression \\(n^3 + an^2 + bn + c\\) because it grows much faster than the other terms. Specifically, the terms \\(an^2\\), \\(bn\\), and \\(c\\) become relatively insignificant compared to \\(n^3\\) as \\(n\\) increases.\n\nNow, let's think about the nature of perfect squares. A perfect square is an integer of the form \\(k^2\\) for some integer \\(k\\). If \\(n^3 + an^2 + bn + c\\) were a perfect square, it would mean that there exists some integer \\(k\\) such that \\(k^2 = n^3 + an^2 + bn + c\\).\n\nHowever, as \\(n\\) becomes very large, the expression \\(n^3 + an^2 + bn + c\\) is approximately \\(n^3\\), which is not typically a perfect square. In fact, perfect squares are much less frequent than cubes among large numbers. For instance, between two consecutive cubes, there are usually no perfect squares. This is because the difference between consecutive cubes grows larger than the difference between consecutive squares as numbers increase.\n\nTo make this more concrete, consider the difference between \\(n^3\\) and \\((n+1)^3\\), which is \\(3n^2 + 3n + 1\\). This difference is much larger than the difference between consecutive squares, which is \\(2n + 1\\). Therefore, as \\(n\\) increases, the likelihood that \\(n^3 + an^2 + bn + c\\) lands exactly on a perfect square becomes very small.\n\nThus, for sufficiently large \\(n\\), the expression \\(n^3 + an^2 + bn + c\\) will not be a perfect square, meaning \\(\\sqrt{n^3 + an^2 + bn + c}\\) will not be an integer. This shows that there always exists a positive integer \\(n\\) such that \\(\\sqrt{n^3 + an^2 + bn + c}\\) is not an integer, regardless of the specific values of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'use'\nlinarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase h\na b c : \u2124\nn : \u2124 := 1 + max (max |a| |b|) |c|\na\u271d : 0 \u2265 n\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nunexpected token ','; expected command\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",
