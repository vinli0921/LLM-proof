",0,1,139012,"# Informal Proof:\n\nTo prove that a holomorphic function $f$ with a constant imaginary part is constant, we start by expressing $f$ as a sum of its real and imaginary parts, denoted by $u$ and $v$ respectively. This gives us $f(z) = u(x, y) + i v(x, y)$, where $z = x + i y$.\n\nSince the imaginary part of $f$ is constant, we have $\frac{\partial v}{\partial x} = 0$ and $\frac{\partial v}{\partial y} = 0$. This implies that the partial derivatives of $v$ with respect to both $x$ and $y$ are zero.\n\nUsing the Cauchy-Riemann equations, we can relate the partial derivatives of $u$ and $v$. Specifically, we have $\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = 0$ and $\frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = 0$. This means that the partial derivatives of $u$ with respect to both $x$ and $y$ are also zero.\n\nNow, we can apply the fact that a function with zero derivative is constant. In particular, we can consider the function $x \mapsto u(x, y)$ for a fixed value of $y$. Since the partial derivative of $u$ with respect to $x$ is zero, we have $u(x, y) = F(y)$ for some function $F(y)$. Similarly, we can consider the function $y \mapsto u(x, y)$ for a fixed value of $x$. Since the partial derivative of $u$ with respect to $y$ is zero, we have $u(x, y) = G(x)$ for some function $G(x)$.\n\nHowever, we have $u(x, y) = F(y) = G(x)$ for all $x$ and $y$. This implies that $F(y)$ and $G(x)$ are equal for all $y$ and $x$. In particular, we can fix a value $x_0$ and set $c = G(x_0)$. Then, we have $F(y) = c$ for all $y$. This means that $u(x, y) = c$ for all $x$ and $y$.\n\nSince both $u$ and $v$ are constant, we have $f(z) = u(x, y) + i v(x, y) = c + i 0 = c$ for all $z$. This shows that $f$ is constant.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that a holomorphic function with a constant imaginary part is indeed constant.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\n\nopen Complex Filter Function Metric Finset\nopen scoped BigOperators Topology\n\n/-- Suppose that $f$ is holomorphic in an open set $\Omega$.

Since the partial derivative of $u$ with respect to $x$ is zero, we can apply the ""Zero Derivative implies Constant Function"" theorem to conclude that $u(x, y)$ is a function of $y$ alone.\n\nSimilarly, let's consider the function $u(x, y)$ for a fixed value of $x$. Since the partial derivative of $u$ with respect to $y$ is zero, we can apply the ""Zero Derivative implies Constant Function"" theorem to conclude that $u(x, y)$ is a function of $x$ alone.\n\nHowever, this is a contradiction, since $u(x, y)$ cannot be a function of both $x$ and $y$ alone. Therefore, we must conclude that $u(x, y)$ is actually a constant function.\n\nSince both $u(x, y)$ and $v(x, y)$ are constant functions, we can conclude that $f(z) = u(x, y) + i v(x, y)$ is also a constant function.\n\nTherefore, if $f$ is holomorphic in an open set $\Omega$ and $\text{Im}(f)$ is constant, then $f$ is constant.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\n\nopen Complex Filter Function Metric Finset\nopen scoped BigOperators Topology\n\ntheorem exercise_1_13b {f : ℂ → ℂ} (Ω : Set ℂ) (a b : Ω) (h : IsOpen Ω)\n  (hf : DifferentiableOn ℂ f Ω) (hc : ∃ (c : ℝ), ∀ z ∈ Ω, (f z).im = c) :\n  f a = f b := by\n  obtain ⟨c, hc⟩ := hc\n  have h_const_im : ∀ z ∈ Ω, (f z).im = c := hc\n  have h_const_im_a : (f a).im = c := h_const_im a a.2\n  have h_const_im_b : (f b).im = c := h_const_im b b.2\n  have h_const_re : ∀ z ∈ Ω, (f z).re = (f a).re := by\n    intro z hz\n    have h_diff : DifferentiableAt ℂ f z := hf.differentiableAt (IsOpen.mem_nhds h hz)\n    have h_cr : ∂ (fun z => (f z).im) z = 0 := by\n      rw [hc z hz]\n      exact hasDerivAt_const z c\n    have h_cr' : ∂ (fun z => (f z).re) z = 0 := by\n      have h_diff' : DifferentiableAt ℂ (fun z => (f z).re) z :=\n        h_diff.comp z (fun z => (f z).re)\n      exact hasDerivAt_const z ((f a).re)\n    exact h_cr'\n  have h_const_re_b : (f b).re = (f a).re := h_const_re b b.2\n  exact Complex.ext h_const_re_b h_const_im_a\n```",False

",0,1,70811,"# Informal Proof:\n\nTo prove that the power series $\sum nz^n$ does not converge on any point of the unit circle, we can start by considering the properties of the power series and its behavior on the unit circle.\n\nFirst, let's recall that the power series $\sum nz^n$ is a series of complex numbers, where $n$ is a positive integer and $z$ is a complex number. The series is said to converge if the sequence of partial sums $\sum_{k=1}^n z^k$ converges to a limit as $n$ approaches infinity.\n\nNow, let's consider the unit circle, which is the set of complex numbers $z$ such that $|z| = 1$. We want to show that the power series $\sum nz^n$ does not converge on any point of the unit circle.\n\nTo do this, we can use the fact that the power series $\sum nz^n$ is a geometric series with common ratio $z$. A geometric series is said to converge if the absolute value of the common ratio is less than 1.\n\nHowever, on the unit circle, we have $|z| = 1$, which means that the absolute value of the common ratio is equal to 1. Therefore, the geometric series $\sum nz^n$ does not converge on the unit circle.\n\nIn fact, we can show that the series diverges by considering the limit of the partial sums. Let's consider the partial sum $S_n = \sum_{k=1}^n z^k$. We can rewrite this as $S_n = \frac{1 - z^{n+1}}{1 - z}$.\n\nNow, let's take the limit of $S_n$ as $n$ approaches infinity. We have:\n\n$$\lim_{n \to \infty} S_n = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1 - z^{n+1}}{1 - z}$$\n\nSince $|z| = 1$, we have $z^{n+1} \to 1$ as $n \to \infty$. Therefore, the limit of $S_n$ does not exist, and the series diverges.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that the power series $\sum nz^n$ does not converge on any point of the unit circle.\n\nNote that this result is consistent with the fact that the power series $\sum nz^n$ is not absolutely convergent on the unit circle. In fact, we can show that the series is not even conditionally convergent on the unit circle.\n\nTo see this, let's consider the series $\sum nz^n$ on the unit circle. We can rewrite this as $\sum nz^n = \sum n(\cos \theta + i \sin \theta)^n$, where $\theta$ is the argument of $z$.\n\nNow, let's consider the real and imaginary parts of the series separately. We have:\n\n$$\sum n \cos n \theta = \sum n \cos \theta \cos (n-1) \theta + \sum n \sin \theta \sin (n-1) \theta$$\n\nUsing the trigonometric identity $\cos (n-1) \theta = \cos (n \theta - \theta)$, we can rewrite this as:\n\n$$\sum n \cos n \theta = \sum n \cos \theta \cos (n \theta - \theta) + \sum n \sin \theta \sin (n \theta - \theta)$$\n\nNow, let's consider the limit of the partial sums of the real and imaginary parts separately. We have:\n\n$$\lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{k=1}^n n \cos k \theta = \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{k=1}^n n \cos \theta \cos (k \theta - \theta) + \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{k=1}^n n \sin \theta \sin (k \theta - \theta)$$\n\nUsing the fact that the series is not absolutely convergent on the unit circle, we can show that the limit of the partial sums does not exist.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that the power series $\sum nz^n$ is not even conditionally convergent on the unit circle.\n\nIn conclusion, we have shown that the power series $\sum nz^n$ does not converge on any point of the unit circle. This result is consistent with the fact that the series is not absolutely convergent on the unit circle, and it provides further evidence that the series is not conditionally convergent on the unit circle.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\n\nopen Complex Filter Function Metric Finset\nopen scoped BigOperators Topology\n\ntheorem exercise_1_19a (z : ℂ) (hz : abs z = 1) (s : ℕ → ℂ)\n    (h : s = (λ n => ∑ i in (range n), i * z ^ i)) :\n    ¬ ∃ y, Tendsto s atTop (𝓝 y) := by\n  intro h_exists\n  rcases h_exists with ⟨y, hy⟩\n  have h_abs : ∀ n, abs (s n) ≤ ∑ i in range n, abs (i * z ^ i) := by\n    intro n\n    rw [h]\n    exact Complex.abs.sum_le (fun i _ => Complex.abs.mul (Complex.abs.ofNat i) (Complex.abs.pow z i))\n  have h_sum : ∑' i, abs (i * z ^ i) = ∞ := by\n    have h_abs_i : ∀ i, abs (i * z ^ i) = i * abs z ^ i := by\n      intro i\n      rw [Complex.abs.mul, Complex.abs.ofNat, Complex.abs.pow]\n    simp only [h_abs_i, hz, Complex.abs.ofNat, mul_one]\n    exact ENNReal.tsum_eq_top_of_eq_top (fun i => i) (fun i => i) (fun i => rfl) (fun i => rfl)\n  have h_lim : Tendsto (fun n => ∑ i in range n, abs (i * z ^ i)) atTop atTop := by\n    rw [← ENNReal.tendsto_coe]\n    exact ENNReal.tendsto_atTop_of_tsum_eq_top h_sum\n  have h_lim_s : Tendsto (fun n => abs (s n)) atTop atTop := by\n    refine' tendsto_of_tendsto_of_tendsto_of_le_of_le' tendsto_const_nhds h_lim _ _\n    · intro n\n      exact le_refl 0\n    · intro n\n      exact h_abs n\n  have h_lim_y : Tendsto (fun n => abs (s n - y)) atTop (𝓝 0) := by\n    rw [← Complex.abs_zero]\n    exact Complex.abs.tendsto_iff.mpr (hy.sub tendsto_const_nhds)\n  have h_lim_abs : Tendsto (fun n => abs (s n - y)) atTop atTop := by\n    refine' tendsto_of_tendsto_of_tendsto_of_le_of_le' h_lim_s h_lim_y _ _\n    · intro n\n      exact le_refl 0\n    · intro n\n      exact Complex.abs.nonneg (s n - y)\n  exact absurd h_lim_abs (not_tendsto_atTop_of_tendsto_nhds h_lim_y)\n```",False

We know that the power series converges at every point of the unit circle except for the points where the series diverges.\n\nTo determine the points of divergence, we can use the ratio test. The ratio test states that a series $\sum a_n$ converges if the limit of the ratio $\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}$ is less than 1.\n\nIn this case, we have $a_n = \frac{1}{n}$, so the ratio is $\frac{\frac{1}{n+1}}{\frac{1}{n}} = \frac{n}{n+1}$. Taking the limit as $n$ approaches infinity, we get $\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{n}{n+1} = 1$.\n\nHowever, we also need to consider the case where $z = 1$. In this case, the series becomes $\sum \frac{1}{n}$, which is the harmonic series. The harmonic series is known to diverge.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the power series $\sum \frac{z^n}{n}$ converges at every point of the unit circle except for the point $z = 1$.\n\nTo prove that the series converges at every point of the unit circle except $z = 1$, we can use the fact that the series is absolutely convergent. The series is absolutely convergent if the series of absolute values $\sum |a_n|$ converges.\n\nIn this case, we have $|a_n| = \frac{1}{n}$, so the series of absolute values is $\sum \frac{1}{n}$. This series is known to converge.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the power series $\sum \frac{z^n}{n}$ is absolutely convergent at every point of the unit circle except for the point $z = 1$.\n\nSince the series is absolutely convergent, we can use the fact that the terms of an absolutely convergent series converge to zero. This means that the terms of the series $\sum \frac{z^n}{n}$ converge to zero at every point of the unit circle except for the point $z = 1$.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the power series $\sum \frac{z^n}{n}$ converges at every point of the unit circle except for the point $z = 1$.\n\nThis completes the proof.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\n\nopen Complex Filter Function Metric Finset\nopen scoped BigOperators Topology\n\ntheorem exercise_1_19c (z : ℂ) (hz : abs z = 1) (hz2 : z ≠ 1) (s : ℕ → ℂ)\n    (h : s = (λ n => ∑ i in (range n), i * z / i)) :\n    ∃ z, Tendsto s atTop (𝓝 z) :=\nbegin\n  use 0,\n  rw [h],\n  apply tendsto_const_nhds.congr' _,\n  intro n,\n  rw [sum_eq_zero],\n  intro i hi,\n  rw [mul_div_cancel_left],\n  exact Nat.cast_ne_zero.2 (ne_of_lt (mem_range.1 hi)),\nend\n```",False

Specifically, we can substitute $t = p x$, which allows us to rewrite the integral in terms of $t$ instead of $x$. \n\nThis substitution is crucial because it enables us to transform the integral of $\frac{\sin p x}{x}$ into the integral of $\frac{\sin t}{t}$, which is a known integral that evaluates to $\frac{\pi}{2}$. This is a well-known result, often referred to as the Dirichlet Integral.\n\nNow, to prove that the integral of $\frac{\sin x}{x}$ from $0$ to $\infty$ is equal to $\frac{\pi}{2}$, we can use the fact that the sine function is odd. This means that $\sin(-x) = -\sin(x)$, and we can use this property to rewrite the integral of $\frac{\sin(-p x)}{x}$ in terms of the integral of $\frac{\sin p x}{x}$.\n\nBy using the odd property of the sine function, we can show that the integral of $\frac{\sin(-p x)}{x}$ is equal to $-\int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{\sin p x}{x} dx$, which is the negative of the integral we are trying to evaluate.\n\nHowever, we know that the integral of $\frac{\sin p x}{x}$ from $0$ to $\infty$ is equal to $\frac{\pi}{2p}$, and we can use this result to evaluate the integral of $\frac{\sin(-p x)}{x}$.\n\nBy setting $p = 1$, we can show that the integral of $\frac{\sin(-x)}{x}$ is equal to $-\frac{\pi}{2}$, which is the negative of the integral we are trying to evaluate.\n\nFinally, we can use the fact that the integral of $\frac{\sin 0 x}{x}$ from $0$ to $\infty$ is equal to $0$, since the sine of zero is zero.\n\nBy combining these results, we can conclude that the integral of $\frac{\sin x}{x}$ from $0$ to $\infty$ is indeed equal to $\frac{\pi}{2}$.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\n\nopen Complex Filter Function Metric Finset\nopen scoped BigOperators Topology\n\n/-- Show that $\int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{\sin x}{x} d x=\frac{\pi}{2}$.-/\n\ntheorem exercise_2_2 :\n  Tendsto (λ y => ∫ x in (0 : ℝ)..y, Real.sin x / x) atTop (𝓝 (Real.pi / 2)) :=\n```",False

In this case, we have:\n\n$\int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{\sin 0 x}{x} d x = \int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{0}{x} d x$\n\nSince the numerator is zero, the integral is also zero.\n\nTherefore, we have:\n\n$\int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{\sin p x}{x} d x = \begin{cases} \frac{\pi}{2p} & \text{if } p \neq 0 \\ 0 & \text{if } p = 0 \end{cases}$\n\nThis completes the proof.\n\nTo prove the second part of the problem, we can use the fact that the sine function is odd.

",0,1,89811,"# Informal Proof:\n\nTo prove that $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{x \sin x}{x^2 + a^2} dx = \pi e^{-a}$ for $a > 0$, we can start by considering the given theorem: $\int_0^\infty \frac {\sin m x} {x \paren {x^2 + a^2} } \rd x = \frac \pi {2 a^2} \paren {1 - e^{-m a} }$. This theorem provides a definite integral of a similar function, but with a restriction to the interval $[0, \infty)$.\n\nWe can relate this theorem to our problem by using a clever substitution. Let's consider the function $f(x) = \frac{x \sin x}{x^2 + a^2}$. We can rewrite this function as $f(x) = \frac{\sin x}{x} \cdot \frac{x}{x^2 + a^2}$. Now, we can see that the first part of the product, $\frac{\sin x}{x}$, is a well-known function that has a Fourier transform of $\pi$ for $x > 0$. The second part of the product, $\frac{x}{x^2 + a^2}$, is a function that has a Fourier transform of $\frac{\pi}{a} e^{-|x|}$.\n\nUsing the convolution property of the Fourier transform, we can write the Fourier transform of $f(x)$ as the product of the Fourier transforms of the two parts. This gives us: $\mathcal{F}\{f(x)\} = \pi \cdot \frac{\pi}{a} e^{-|x|} = \frac{\pi^2}{a} e^{-|x|}$.\n\nNow, we can use the fact that the Fourier transform of a function is equal to the integral of the function multiplied by $e^{-i\omega x}$, where $\omega$ is the frequency. In this case, we have: $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{x \sin x}{x^2 + a^2} dx = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) dx = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{\sin x}{x} \cdot \frac{x}{x^2 + a^2} dx$.\n\nUsing the convolution property again, we can rewrite this integral as: $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{\sin x}{x} \cdot \frac{x}{x^2 + a^2} dx = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{\sin x}{x} dx \cdot \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{x}{x^2 + a^2} dx$.\n\nThe first integral on the right-hand side is equal to $\pi$, and the second integral is equal to $\frac{\pi}{a} e^{-a}$. Therefore, we have: $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{x \sin x}{x^2 + a^2} dx = \pi \cdot \frac{\pi}{a} e^{-a} = \pi e^{-a}$.\n\nThis completes the proof that $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{x \sin x}{x^2 + a^2} dx = \pi e^{-a}$ for $a > 0$.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\n\nopen Complex Filter Function Metric Finset\nopen scoped BigOperators Topology\n\n/-- Show that $ \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{x \sin x}{x^2 + a^2} dx = \pi e^{-a}$ for $a > 0$.-/\ntheorem exercise_3_4 (a : ℝ) (ha : 0 < a) :\n    Tendsto (λ y => ∫ x in -y..y, x * Real.sin x / (x ^ 2 + a ^ 2))\n    atTop (𝓝 (Real.pi * (Real.exp (-a)))) :=\n```",False

We also know that the complex numbers have a unity element, denoted by $1$, which is strictly positive.\n\nNow, let's consider the element $i$ in the complex numbers. By definition of strict positivity, either $i$ is strictly positive or $-i$ is strictly positive. Suppose $i$ is strictly positive.

We have:\n\n$|\mathbf{x}+\mathbf{y}|^{2} = (\mathbf{x}+\mathbf{y}) \cdot (\mathbf{x}+\mathbf{y}) = \mathbf{x} \cdot \mathbf{x} + 2\mathbf{x} \cdot \mathbf{y} + \mathbf{y} \cdot \mathbf{y}$\n\nSimilarly, we have:\n\n$|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}|^{2} = (\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}) \cdot (\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}) = \mathbf{x} \cdot \mathbf{x} - 2\mathbf{x} \cdot \mathbf{y} + \mathbf{y} \cdot \mathbf{y}$\n\nNow, let's add the two equations together:\n\n$|\mathbf{x}+\mathbf{y}|^{2} + |\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}|^{2} = 2\mathbf{x} \cdot \mathbf{x} + 2\mathbf{y} \cdot \mathbf{y}$\n\nRecall that the magnitude of a vector $\mathbf{v}$ is defined as $|\mathbf{v}| = \sqrt{\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{v}}$. Therefore, we can rewrite the right-hand side of the equation as:\n\n$2\mathbf{x} \cdot \mathbf{x} + 2\mathbf{y} \cdot \mathbf{y} = 2|\mathbf{x}|^{2} + 2|\mathbf{y}|^{2}$\n\nThis completes the proof.\n\nNote that the key insight here is to use the properties of the dot product to expand the left-hand side of the equation, and then to use the definition of the magnitude of a vector to rewrite the right-hand side of the equation. This allows us to show that the two sides of the equation are equal, which completes the proof.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib.Analysis.NormedSpace.InnerProduct\n\nopen InnerProductSpace\n\ntheorem exercise_1_17\n  (n : ℕ)\n  (x y : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)) -- R^n\n  : ‖x + y‖^2 + ‖x - y‖^2 = 2*‖x‖^2 + 2*‖y‖^2 :=\nbegin\n  simp [norm_sq_eq_inner, inner_add_left, inner_add_right, inner_sub_left, inner_sub_right,\n        inner_self_eq_norm_sq, mul_add, mul_sub, add_mul, sub_mul, add_assoc, add_comm, add_left_comm,\n        sub_eq_add_neg, neg_mul, mul_neg, neg_neg, mul_comm, mul_assoc, mul_left_comm],\n  ring,\nend\n```",False

This means that the sum of the products of corresponding components of $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ is equal to zero.\n\nWe can rewrite this equation as $x_1y_1 + x_2y_2 + \ldots + x_ky_k = 0$. Since $\mathbf{y}$ is non-zero, at least one of its components, say $y_i$, is not equal to zero.\n\nNow, let's consider the vector $\mathbf{z} = \mathbf{x} + \mathbf{y}$. The components of $\mathbf{z}$ are given by $z_i = x_i + y_i$. Since $y_i$ is not equal to zero, $z_i$ is also not equal to zero.\n\nHowever, we can also compute the dot product of $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{z}$: $\mathbf{x} \cdot \mathbf{z} = x_1(x_1 + y_1) + x_2(x_2 + y_2) + \ldots + x_k(x_k + y_k)$.

",0,1,9779,"# Informal Proof:\n\nTo prove that every compact metric space $K$ has a countable base, we can start by recalling the definition of a compact space. A space $T = \struct {S, \tau}$ is compact if every open cover of $S$ has a finite subcover. In the context of a metric space, this means that for any collection of open sets that cover the space, we can always find a finite subset of those open sets that still cover the space.\n\nNow, let's consider the concept of a base for a topology. A base (or basis) for a topology on a set $S$ is a collection $\mathcal{B}$ of open sets such that every open set in the topology can be written as a union of sets in $\mathcal{B}$. In other words, $\mathcal{B}$ is a base if every open set in the topology is ""generated"" by the sets in $\mathcal{B}$.\n\nTo show that every compact metric space $K$ has a countable base, we can use the fact that a metric space is compact if and only if it is sequentially compact. This means that if we have a sequence of points in the space that has a convergent subsequence, then the entire sequence must converge to a point in the space.\n\nLet's assume that $K$ is a compact metric space. We want to show that $K$ has a countable base. To do this, we can use the fact that a metric space is compact if and only if it is sequentially compact. Let $\{B_n\}$ be a countable collection of open balls in $K$ such that for every point $x$ in $K$, there exists an open ball $B_n$ that contains $x$. This is possible because the space is metric, and we can use the fact that every point in a metric space has a neighborhood that is homeomorphic to an open ball in $\mathbb{R}^n$.\n\nNow, let's consider the collection $\mathcal{B}$ of all finite intersections of the open balls $B_n$. This collection is countable because it is a countable union of countable sets. We claim that $\mathcal{B}$ is a base for the topology on $K$.\n\nTo see this, let $U$ be an open set in $K$. We want to show that $U$ can be written as a union of sets in $\mathcal{B}$. Since $K$ is compact, we know that $U$ is a union of a finite number of open sets. Let $U_1, U_2, \ldots, U_m$ be these open sets. For each $i$, let $x_i$ be a point in $U_i$. Since $U_i$ is open, there exists an open ball $B_{n_i}$ that contains $x_i$ and is contained in $U_i$. Let $B = \bigcap_{i=1}^m B_{n_i}$. Then $B$ is a finite intersection of open balls, and therefore $B$ is in $\mathcal{B}$. We claim that $B$ is contained in $U$.\n\nTo see this, let $x$ be a point in $B$. Then $x$ is in each of the open balls $B_{n_i}$, and therefore $x$ is in each of the open sets $U_i$. Since $U$ is a union of the $U_i$, we know that $x$ is in $U$. Therefore, $B$ is contained in $U$.\n\nWe have shown that every open set $U$ in $K$ can be written as a union of sets in $\mathcal{B}$. Therefore, $\mathcal{B}$ is a base for the topology on $K$.\n\nWe have also shown that $\mathcal{B}$ is countable because it is a countable union of countable sets.

Recall that a compact metric space is a topological space that is both compact and metrizable. This means that the space has a metric $d$ that induces the topology, and the space is compact with respect to this metric.\n\n2.  We know that a compact metric space has the property that every open cover has a finite subcover. This is a fundamental property of compact spaces.\n\n3.  To show that $K$ has a countable base, we need to find a countable collection of open sets $\mathcal{B}$ such that every open set in $K$ can be expressed as a union of sets in $\mathcal{B}$.\n\n4.

Then the open ball $B(x, \epsilon)$ is an open set in $K$. We can use these open balls to construct a countable base.\n\n6.

Therefore, $x$ is contained in the open interval $\openint \frac{1}{n} 1$.\n\nWe can repeat this process for every open interval within $U$, covering each one with a collection of open intervals of the form $\openint \frac{1}{n} 1$. This will give us a collection of open intervals that cover $U$.\n\nHowever, we need to show that this collection of open intervals is countable. To do this, we can note that each open interval in the collection is of the form $\openint \frac{1}{n} 1$, where $n$ is a positive integer. Therefore, we can index the collection of open intervals by the positive integers, with the $n$th open interval being $\openint \frac{1}{n} 1$.\n\nThis gives us a countable collection of open intervals that cover $U$. However, we need to show that these open intervals are disjoint. To do this, we can note that if two open intervals in the collection overlap, then they must have the same index $n$. But this is impossible, since the open intervals are of the form $\openint \frac{1}{n} 1$, and two intervals with the same index cannot overlap.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that every open set in $\mathbb{R}$ is the union of a countable collection of disjoint open intervals.

This is because open sets are defined as sets where every point has a neighborhood that lies entirely within the set.\n\nNow, for each point $x \in U$, we can find the smallest open interval $(a_x, b_x)$ such that $x \in (a_x, b_x) \subseteq U$. This is possible because the open intervals $(a, b)$ that contain $x$ form a decreasing sequence of intervals, and we can take the intersection of these intervals to obtain the smallest interval $(a_x, b_x)$ that contains $x$.\n\nWe can then consider the collection of all these smallest open intervals $(a_x, b_x)$ for all $x \in U$. This collection forms a countable collection of disjoint segments because each point $x \in U$ corresponds to a unique interval $(a_x, b_x)$, and these intervals are disjoint because they are the smallest intervals that contain each point $x$.\n\nMoreover, the union of these disjoint segments is equal to the original open set $U$. This is because every point $x \in U$ is contained in one of the smallest intervals $(a_x, b_x)$, and therefore every point $x \in U$ is contained in the union of these intervals.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that every open set $U$ in $\mathbb{R}$ is the union of an at most countable collection of disjoint segments.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\n\nopen Topology Filter Real Complex TopologicalSpace Finset\nopen scoped BigOperators\n\n/-- Prove that every open set in $\mathbb{R}$ is the union of an at most countable collection of disjoint segments.-/\ntheorem exercise_2_29 (U : Set ℝ) (hU : IsOpen U) :\n  ∃ (f : ℕ → Set ℝ), (∀ n, ∃ a b : ℝ, f n = {x | a < x ∧ x < b}) ∧ (∀ n, f n ⊆ U) ∧\n  (∀ n m, n ≠ m → f n ∩ f m = ∅) ∧\n  U = ⋃ n, f n :=\nbegin\n  -- For each point x in U, find the smallest open interval (a_x, b_x) such that x ∈ (a_x, b_x) ⊆ U.\n  let f := λ x : U, {y | y.1 < x.1 ∧ x.1 < y.1},\n  use f,\n  split,\n  { intro n,\n    obtain ⟨a, b, hab⟩ := hU.exists_open_interval_subset (mem_univ n),\n    use [a, b],\n    ext,\n    simp [f, hab] },\n  split,\n  { intro n,\n    exact subset_univ _ },\n  split,\n  { intros n m hnm,\n    exact disjoint_iff.mpr (inter_eq_empty_of_disjoint (f n) (f m) hnm) },\n  { ext x,\n    split,\n    { intro hx,\n      obtain ⟨a, b, hab⟩ := hU.exists_open_interval_subset hx,\n      use a,\n      use b,\n      simp [f, hab] },\n    { intro hx,\n      obtain ⟨a, b, hab⟩ := hx,\n      exact hab.1 } }\nend\n```",False

We can rewrite this as $\sqrt{n(n + 1)}$. \n\nNow, we can use the fact that $n^{1/n} = 1 + a_n$ to our advantage. We can rewrite $\sqrt{n(n + 1)}$ as $\sqrt{n} \cdot \sqrt{n + 1}$. \n\nUsing the fact that $n^{1/n} = 1 + a_n$, we can express $\sqrt{n}$ as $n^{1/2} = 1 + a_n^{1/2}$ and $\sqrt{n + 1}$ as $(1 + a_n)^{1/2}$. \n\nNow, we can use the binomial expansion to expand $(1 + a_n)^{1/2}$. We get $(1 + a_n)^{1/2} = 1 + \frac{1}{2}a_n + \frac{1}{2!}a_n^2 + \ldots$. \n\nHowever, we are only interested in the first two terms of this expansion. Therefore, we can approximate $(1 + a_n)^{1/2}$ as $1 + \frac{1}{2}a_n$. \n\nNow, we can rewrite $\sqrt{n(n + 1)}$ as $(1 + a_n^{1/2})(1 + \frac{1}{2}a_n)$. \n\nExpanding this expression, we get $1 + a_n^{1/2} + \frac{1}{2}a_n + \frac{1}{2}a_n^{3/2}$. \n\nNow, we can use the fact that $a_n > 0$ for $n > 1$ to our advantage. We can rewrite $a_n^{1/2}$ as $\sqrt{a_n}$ and $a_n^{3/2}$ as $(\sqrt{a_n})^3$. \n\nSince $a_n > 0$, we know that $\sqrt{a_n} > 0$ and $(\sqrt{a_n})^3 > 0$. \n\nTherefore, we can rewrite $\sqrt{n(n + 1)}$ as $1 + \sqrt{a_n} + \frac{1}{2}a_n + \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{a_n})^3$. \n\nNow, we can use the fact that $n -

n = (1 + \sqrt{a_n} + \frac{1}{2}a_n) - n$ to our advantage. \n\nWe can rewrite this as $\sqrt{n(n + 1)} - n = \sqrt{a_n} + \frac{1}{2}a_n - (n - 1)$. \n\nNow, we can use the fact that $n - 1 \ge \frac{1}{2}na_n^2$ for $n > 1$ to our advantage. \n\nWe can rewrite this as $n -

We can do this by using the fact that $n^{1/n} = 1 + a_n$ and the binomial expansion of $(1 + a_n)^n$. \n\nThe binomial expansion of $(1 + a_n)^n$ is given by $1 + n a_n + \dfrac {n \paren {n - 1} } {2!} a_n^2 + \ldots$. \n\nSince $n^{1/n} = 1 + a_n$, we have $n = (1 + a_n)^n = 1 + n a_n + \dfrac {n \paren {n - 1} } {2!} a_n^2 + \ldots$. \n\nComparing the coefficients of the $a_n$ term on both sides, we get $0 = n a_n$, which implies that $a_n = 0$ is not a solution. \n\nHowever, we also have $n > 1$, which implies that $a_n > 0$. \n\nNext, we need to prove that $n - 1 \ge \dfrac {n \paren {n - 1} } {2!} a_n^2$ for $n > 1$. \n\nWe can do this by using the fact that $n = (1 + a_n)^n = 1 + n a_n + \dfrac {n \paren {n - 1} } {2!} a_n^2 + \ldots$. \n\nSince $n > 1$, we have $n - 1 > 0$. \n\nWe can then rearrange the inequality to get $n - 1 \ge \dfrac {n \paren {n - 1} } {2!} a_n^2$. \n\nFinally, we can use the fact that $0 \le a_n^2 \le \dfrac 2 n$ to prove that $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\sqrt{n^2 + n} -n = 1/2$. \n\nWe can do this by using the fact that $\sqrt{n^2 + n} + n = n(1 + a_n)$. \n\nWe can then rewrite the expression $\sqrt{n^2 + n} - n$ as $\frac{n}{\sqrt{n^2 + n} + n} = \frac{1}{1 + a_n}$. \n\nSince $0 \le a_n^2 \le \dfrac 2 n$, we have $0 \le a_n \le \sqrt{\dfrac 2 n}$. \n\nWe can then use the squeeze theorem to prove that $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\frac{1}{1 + a_n} = \frac{1}{2}$. \n\nThis completes the proof that $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\sqrt{n^2 + n} -n = 1/2$.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\n\nopen Topology Filter Real Complex TopologicalSpace Finset\nopen scoped BigOperators\n\ntheorem exercise_3_2a : Tendsto (λ (n : ℝ) => (sqrt (n^2 + n) - n)) atTop (𝓝 (1/2)) :=\n  by\n  apply tendsto_iff_norm_sub_tendsto_zero.mpr\n  have h : ∀ n : ℝ, 0 ≤ sqrt (n^2 + n) := fun n => sqrt_nonneg (n^2 + n)\n  refine' squeeze_zero (fun n => norm_nonneg _) (fun n => _) _\n  · rw [norm_eq_abs, abs_of_nonneg (sub_nonneg.mpr (le_of_lt (sqrt_pos.mpr (lt_add_of_pos_right (n^2) n))))]\n    exact sqrt_sub_self_sq (le_of_lt (lt_add_of_pos_right (n^2) n))\n  · exact tendsto_const_nhds.div_atTop (tendsto_const_nhds.add tendsto_id)\n```",False

We want to show that the limsup of their sum is less than or equal to the sum of their individual limsups.\n\nWe can start by considering the definition of limsup. For any $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a subsequence $\{a_{n_k}\}$ of $\{a_n\}$ such that $\lim_{k \to \infty} a_{n_k} = \limsup_{n \to \infty} a_n$. Similarly, there exists a subsequence $\{b_{m_k}\}$ of $\{b_n\}$ such that $\lim_{k \to \infty} b_{m_k} = \limsup_{n \to \infty} b_n$.\n\nNow, consider the subsequence $\{a_{n_k} + b_{m_k}\}$ of the sum $\{a_n + b_n\}$.

Then, there exists a subsequence $\{a_{n_k} + b_{n_k}\}$ that converges to $L$.\n\nSince the sum of two convergent sequences is also convergent, we know that $\{a_{n_k}\}$ and $\{b_{n_k}\}$ are both convergent subsequences of $\{a_n\}$ and $\{b_n\}$, respectively.\n\nLet $L_a$ and $L_b$ be the subsequential limits of $\{a_n\}$ and $\{b_n\}$, respectively.

Since each $E_n$ is closed, nonempty, and bounded, we know that each $E_n$ has a diameter, denoted by $\operatorname{diam} E_n$. We are also given that $\lim_{n \to \infty} \operatorname{diam} E_n = 0$.\n\nNow, let's consider the intersection of the sets in the sequence, denoted by $\bigcap_{1}^{\infty} E_n$. Since each $E_n$ is nonempty, the intersection is also nonempty.\n\nTo show that the intersection consists of exactly one point, we can use a proof by contradiction. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that the intersection contains more than one point. Then, there exist two distinct points $x$ and $y$ in the intersection.\n\nSince $x$ and $y$ are in the intersection, they are both in each of the sets $E_n$. Since each $E_n$ is bounded, there exists a positive real number $r$ such that $d(x, y) < r$ for all $n$.\n\nHowever, since $\lim_{n \to \infty} \operatorname{diam} E_n = 0$, we know that for any positive real number $\epsilon$, there exists a positive integer $N$ such that $\operatorname{diam} E_n < \epsilon$ for all $n > N$.\n\nIn particular, since $d(x, y) < r$, we can choose $\epsilon = r/2$. Then, there exists a positive integer $N$ such that $\operatorname{diam} E_n < r/2$ for all $n > N$.\n\nNow, consider the set $E_N$. Since $x$ and $y$ are both in $E_N$, we have $d(x, y) < r/2$. However, since $\operatorname{diam} E_N < r/2$, we know that $E_N$ is contained in the open ball of radius $r/2$ centered at $x$.

However, as we proved in the context, this function cannot be extended to a continuous function $g$ on $\mathbb{R}$.\n\nThe key idea here is to show that any continuous function $g$ on $\mathbb{R}$ that agrees with $f$ on $E$ must be discontinuous at $x = 0$.

This means that no matter how we define $f(0)$, the limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches $0$ will not be equal to $f(0)$. This is because for any value $c$ that we choose for $f(0)$, we can find a value of $x$ that is less than $\frac{1}{c}$, and for this value of $x$, $\frac{1}{x}$ is greater than $c$. This implies that the limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches $0$ from the right is greater than $c$, and therefore cannot be equal to $c$.\n\nNow, let's consider a set $E$ that consists of all real numbers except $0$. We can define a function $f$ on $E$ as $f(x) = \frac{1}{x}$ for all $x \in E$.

We want to show that $f$ is monotonic, i.e., either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.\n\nSuppose, for the sake of contradiction, that $f$ is not monotonic. Then, there exist $x, y, z \in R^{1}$ with $x < y < z$ such that either:\n\n1. $\map f x \le \map f y$ and $\map f y \ge \map f z$\n2. $\map f x \ge \map f y$ and $\map f y \le \map f z$\n\nWe will consider case (1) and show that it leads to a contradiction. The proof for case (2) will be similar.\n\nAssume that $\map f x \le \map f y$ and $\map f y \ge \map f z$. If $\map f x = \map f y$, or $\map f y = \map f z$, or $\map f x = \map f z$, then $f$ is not injective, which is a contradiction.\n\nThus, $\map f x < \map f y$ and $\map f y > \map f z$. \n\nNow, suppose $\map f x < \map f z$. This implies that $\map f x < \map f z < \map f y$. Since $f$ is continuous, the Intermediate Value Theorem can be applied. Hence, there exists $c \in (x, y)$ such that $\map f c = \map f z$. \n\nHowever, since $z \notin (x, y)$, we have $c \ne z$. This implies that $f$ is not injective, which is a contradiction.\n\nSimilarly, if we suppose $\map f x > \map f z$, then we get $\map f z < \map f x < \map f y$. Again, applying the Intermediate Value Theorem, we get a contradiction.\n\nIf we suppose $\map f x \ge \map f y$ and $\map f y \le \map f z$, we reach a similar contradiction.\n\nBy Proof by Contradiction, $f$ is monotonic.\n\nNote that the proof for the original theorem (Continuous Injection of Interval is Strictly Monotone) was for a strictly monotone function, whereas our proof here is for a monotonic function (which can be either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing).","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\n\nopen Topology Filter Real Complex TopologicalSpace Finset\nopen scoped BigOperators\n\n/-- Prove that every continuous open mapping of $R^{1}$ into $R^{1}$ is monotonic.-/\ntheorem exercise_4_15 {f : ℝ → ℝ}\n  (hf : Continuous f) (hof : IsOpenMap f) :\n  Monotone f :=\nbegin\n  -- Assume for contradiction that f is not monotone\n  by_contradiction h,\n  -- Then there exist x, y, z such that x < y < z and f(x) <= f(y) and f(y) >= f(z)\n  push_neg at h,\n  rcases h with ⟨x, y, z, hx, hy, hz, h1, h2⟩,\n  -- Since f is continuous and open, we can apply the Intermediate Value Theorem\n  have h3 : f x < f y := by linarith,\n  have h4 : f y > f z := by linarith,\n  -- There exists c in (x, y) such that f(c) = f(z)\n  obtain ⟨c, hc1, hc2⟩ := IntermediateValueTheorem.intermediate_value_Ioo hf hx hy h3,\n  -- This contradicts the injectivity of f\n  have h5 : c ≠ z := by linarith,\n  exact hof.injective hc2 h5,\nend\n```",False

Let $f: R^{1} \to R^{1}$ be a continuous open mapping that is not monotonic.

This suggests that the function values are not changing rapidly as the input values change.\n\nTo show that the function is constant, we can use a proof by contradiction. Assume that there exist two real numbers $x$ and $y$ such that $f(x) \neq f(y)$. Then, we can consider the difference between the function values at $x$ and $y$, which is $|f(x)-f(y)|$.\n\nSince we know that $|f(x)-f(y)| \leq (x-y)^{2}$, we can substitute this inequality into the expression for the difference between the function values. This gives us $|f(x)-f(y)| \leq (x-y)^{2}$.\n\nNow, suppose that $x-y \neq 0$. Then, we can divide both sides of the inequality by $|x-y|$ to get $|f(x)-f(y)|/|x-y| \leq |x-y|$. \n\nHowever, this is a contradiction, since the left-hand side of the inequality is the average rate of change of the function between $x$ and $y$, and the right-hand side is the square of the distance between $x$ and $y$. \n\nSince the average rate of change of the function is bounded by the square of the distance between the input values, it must be that the function is constant.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the function $f$ is constant, since there are no two real numbers $x$ and $y$ such that $f(x) \neq f(y)$.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\n\nopen Topology Filter Real Complex TopologicalSpace Finset\nopen scoped BigOperators\n\n/-- Let $f$ be defined for all real $x$, and suppose that $|f(x)-f(y)| \leq (x-y)^{2}$ for all real $x$ and $y$.

We can factor out $\varepsilon$:\n\n$\varepsilon g(x_1) - \varepsilon g(x_2) = \varepsilon (g(x_1) - g(x_2))$\n\nSince $g$ has a bounded derivative, we know that $\left|g^{\prime}\right| \leq M$.

This is a consequence of the definition of the Riemann integral and the properties of limits.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that $g(x) \rightarrow 0$ as $x \rightarrow +\infty$. This result follows directly from the properties of the derivative of $f$ and the representation of $g(x)$ as an integral of the derivative of $f$.\n\nThe key insight in this proof is the connection between the behavior of $g(x)$ and the behavior of $f^{\prime}(x)$. By analyzing the derivative of $f$ and its behavior as $x$ increases without bound, we can gain a deeper understanding of the behavior of $g(x)$ and its limit as $x$ approaches infinity.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\n\nopen Topology Filter Real Complex TopologicalSpace Finset\nopen scoped BigOperators\n\n/-- Suppose \( f \) is defined and differentiable for every \( x > 0 \), and \( f'(x) \rightarrow 0 \) as \( x \rightarrow +\infty \).

",0,1,33096,"# Informal Proof:\n\nTo prove that $\lim _{t \rightarrow x} \frac{f(t)}{g(t)}=\frac{f^{\prime}(x)}{g^{\prime}(x)}$, we start by considering the definition of a limit. We want to find a $\delta$ such that for all $t$, if $|t - x| < \delta$, then $|\frac{f(t)}{g(t)} - \frac{f^{\prime}(x)}{g^{\prime}(x)}| < \epsilon$.\n\nSince we are dealing with a limit as $t$ approaches $x$ from the right, we can define two new functions, $f_0$ and $g_0$, which are equal to $f$ and $g$ respectively on the interval $(a, b)$, and equal to $0$ at $x=a$. This is possible because $f(x) = g(x) = 0$.\n\nBy the definition of right-continuity, $f_0$ and $g_0$ are continuous on the interval $(a, b]$. We can also see that they are differentiable on the interval $(a, x_\delta)$, where $x_\delta$ is a point such that $0 < x_\delta - a < \delta$.\n\nNow, we can apply the Cauchy Mean Value Theorem to $f_0$ and $g_0$ on the interval $(a, x_\delta)$. This gives us a point $\xi$ in the interval $(a, x_\delta)$ such that $\frac{f^{\prime}_0(\xi)}{g^{\prime}_0(\xi)} = \frac{f_0(x_\delta) - f_0(a)}{g_0(x_\delta) - g_0(a)}$.\n\nSince $f_0(a) = g_0(a) = 0$, we have $\frac{f^{\prime}_0(\xi)}{g^{\prime}_0(\xi)} = \frac{f_0(x_\delta)}{g_0(x_\delta)}$. But since $\xi$ and $x_\delta$ are in the interval $(a, b)$, we can substitute $f^{\prime}_0(\xi) = f^{\prime}(\xi)$, $g^{\prime}_0(\xi) = g^{\prime}(\xi)$, $f_0(x_\delta) = f(x_\delta)$, and $g_0(x_\delta) = g(x_\delta)$.\n\nThis gives us $\frac{f^{\prime}(\xi)}{g^{\prime}(\xi)} = \frac{f(x_\delta)}{g(x_\delta)}$.

",1,1,"92899,6582,6582,1670,167","# Informal Proof:\n\nTo tackle this problem, we need to understand the given conditions and how they relate to the function $f$ and its derivatives. We are given that $f$ is a real, three times differentiable function on the interval $[-1,1]$, with specific values at the endpoints and the first derivative at $x=0$. Our goal is to prove that there exists a point $x$ in the interval $(-1,1)$ such that the third derivative of $f$ at $x$ is greater than or equal to $3$.\n\nLet's start by analyzing the given conditions. We know that $f(-1)=0$, $f(0)=0$, and $f(1)=1$. This tells us that the function $f$ has a specific shape, with a value of $0$ at the left endpoint, a value of $0$ at the midpoint, and a value of $1$ at the right endpoint. We also know that the first derivative of $f$ at $x=0$ is $0$, which means that the function $f$ is not changing at $x=0$.\n\nNow, let's consider the second derivative of $f$, denoted as $f''$. We know that $f''$ is continuous everywhere, except possibly at $x=0$. This means that the rate at which the function $f$ is changing is not constant, and it may have a discontinuity at $x=0$.\n\nTo find the third derivative of $f$, denoted as $f^{(3)}$, we need to differentiate the second derivative $f''$. However, we are not given the expression for $f''$ explicitly. Nevertheless, we can use the given conditions to infer some properties of $f^{(3)}$.\n\nSince $f$ is three times differentiable, we know that $f^{(3)}$ exists and is continuous everywhere, except possibly at the points where $f''$ is discontinuous. In this case, we are interested in finding a point $x$ in the interval $(-1,1)$ such that $f^{(3)}(x) \geq 3$.\n\nLet's consider the function $g(x) = f(x) - x^3$. We can differentiate $g(x)$ to get $g'(x) = f'(x) - 3x^2$. Since $f'(0) = 0$, we have $g'(0) = -3(0)^2 = 0$. This means that the function $g(x)$ has a local minimum at $x=0$.\n\nNow, let's consider the second derivative of $g(x)$, denoted as $g''$. We can differentiate $g'(x)$ to get $g''(x) = f''(x) - 6x$. Since $f''$ is continuous everywhere, except possibly at $x=0$, we know that $g''$ is continuous everywhere, except possibly at $x=0$.\n\nTo find the third derivative of $g(x)$, denoted as $g^{(3)}$, we need to differentiate the second derivative $g''$. We can differentiate $g''(x)$ to get $g^{(3)}(x) = f^{(3)}(x) - 6$. Since $g(x)$ has a local minimum at $x=0$, we know that $g''(0) \geq 0$. This means that $f''(0) - 6(0) \geq 0$, which implies that $f''(0) \geq 0$.\n\nNow, let's consider the point $x=0$. We know that $f''(0) \geq 0$ and $f^{(3)}(0) = g^{(3)}(0) + 6$. Since $g^{(3)}(0)$ is the third derivative of $g(x)$ at $x=0$, we can use the definition of the derivative to write $g^{(3)}(0) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{g(0+h) - g(0)}{h^3}$. Since $g(x)$ has a local minimum at $x=0$, we know that $g(0+h) \geq g(0)$ for all $h$ sufficiently close to $0$. This means that $g^{(3)}(0) \geq 0$.\n\nTherefore, we have $f^{(3)}(0) = g^{(3)}(0) + 6 \geq 0 + 6 = 6$. However, we are interested in finding a point $x$ in the interval $(-1,1)$ such that $f^{(3)}(x) \geq 3$.

Therefore, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there exists a point $x$ in the interval $(-1,1)$ such that $f^{(3)}(x) = 3$.\n\nThis completes the proof that there exists a point $x$ in the interval $(-1,1)$ such that $f^{(3)}(x) \geq 3$.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\n\nopen Topology Filter Real Complex TopologicalSpace Finset\nopen scoped BigOperators\n\ntheorem exercise_5_17\n  {f : ℝ → ℝ}\n  (hf' : DifferentiableOn ℝ f (Set.Icc (-1) 1))\n  (hf'' : DifferentiableOn ℝ (deriv f) (Set.Icc 1 1))\n  (hf''' : DifferentiableOn ℝ (deriv (deriv f)) (Set.Icc 1 1))\n  (hf0 : f (-1) = 0)\n  (hf1 : f 0 = 0)\n  (hf2 : f 1 = 1)\n  (hf3 : deriv f 0 = 0) :\n  ∃ x, x ∈ Set.Ioo (-1 : ℝ) 1 ∧ deriv (deriv (deriv f)) x ≥ 3 :=\nbegin\n  -- We will use the fact that the function f and its derivatives are continuous and differentiable on the interval [-1, 1].\n  -- We are given specific values at the endpoints and the first derivative at x = 0.\n  -- We need to show that there exists a point x in the interval (-1, 1) such that the third derivative of f at x is greater than or equal to 3.\n\n  -- Define a new function g(x) = f(x) - x^3.\n  let g := λ x, f x - x^3,\n\n  -- Compute the first derivative of g.\n  have g' : ℝ → ℝ := λ x, deriv f x - 3 * x^2,\n\n  -- Compute the second derivative of g.\n  have g'' : ℝ → ℝ := λ x, deriv (deriv f) x - 6 * x,\n\n  -- Compute the third derivative of g.\n  have g''' : ℝ → ℝ := λ x, deriv (deriv (deriv f)) x - 6,\n\n  -- Since f is three times differentiable, g''' exists and is continuous everywhere.\n  -- We know that g(x) has a local minimum at x = 0 because g'(0) = 0.\n  have hg0 : g' 0 = 0 := by simp [g', hf3],\n\n  -- Since g(x) has a local minimum at x = 0, g''(0) ≥ 0.\n  have hg''0 : g'' 0 ≥ 0 := by simp [g'', hf3],\n\n  -- Therefore, f''(0) - 6(0) ≥ 0, which implies f''(0) ≥ 0.\n  have hf''0 : deriv (deriv f) 0 ≥ 0 := by linarith,\n\n  -- Now, consider the point x = 0.

We want to show that $S$ contains at least one element other than the identity element $e$.\n\nSince the order of $G$ is even, we can pair up the elements of $G$ in the following way: for each element $a \in G$, there exists a unique element $b \in G$ such that $ab = ba = e$. This is because the group operation is associative, and the identity element $e$ is unique.\n\nNow, let's consider the elements of $S$. For each element $a \in S$, we have $a = a^{-1}$. This means that $a$ is its own inverse, and therefore, it is paired with itself in the pairing described above.\n\nHowever, since the order of $G$ is even, we can pair up the elements of $G$ in pairs, and each pair must contain exactly one element from $S$. This is because if an element $a \in S$ is paired with an element $b \in G$ such that $ab = ba = e$, then $b$ must also be in $S$, since $b = a^{-1} = a$.\n\nSince the order of $G$ is even, and we can pair up the elements of $G$ in pairs, we must have an even number of pairs.

",0,1,8597,"# Informal Proof:\n\nTo prove that there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $a^n = e$ for any given element $a$ in a finite group $G$, we can start by considering the properties of the group and its elements.\n\nFirst, recall that a group is a set of elements with a binary operation (in this case, multiplication) that satisfies certain properties, including closure, associativity, and the existence of an identity element $e$. Additionally, every element in the group has an inverse, which is also an element in the group.\n\nGiven that $G$ is a finite group, we know that there are only a finite number of elements in the group. This means that we can list out all the elements in the group, and for each element $a$, we can consider its powers.\n\nNow, let's consider an element $a$ in the group $G$. We know that $a$ has a finite order, which means that there exists a positive integer $k$ such that $a^k = e$. This is a key property of elements in a group, and it will be crucial in our proof.\n\nNext, let's consider the powers of $a$. We can write any integer $n$ as a multiple of $k$ plus a remainder, $n = qk + r$, where $0 \leq r < k$. This is a standard way of expressing integers in terms of their multiples and remainders.\n\nNow, let's consider the power of $a$ to the $n$th power. We can write $a^n$ as $(a^k)^q \cdot a^r$. Since $a^k = e$, we know that $(a^k)^q = e^q = e$. Therefore, we have $a^n = e \cdot a^r = a^r$.\n\nThis shows that the power of $a$ to the $n$th power is equal to the power of $a$ to the $r$th power, where $0 \leq r < k$. This is a key insight, and it will help us to prove that there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $a^n = e$.\n\nTo see why this is true, let's consider the possible values of $r$. Since $0 \leq r < k$, we know that $r$ can take on any value from $0$ to $k-1$. This means that we can consider the powers of $a$ to the $r$th power for each possible value of $r$.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where $r = 0$. In this case, we have $a^r = a^0 = e$. This shows that $a^n = e$ when $n = 0$.\n\nNext, let's consider the case where $r = 1$. In this case, we have $a^r = a^1 = a$. This shows that $a^n = a$ when $n = 1$.\n\nWe can continue this process, considering the powers of $a$ to the $r$th power for each possible value of $r$. Since $G$ is a finite group, we know that there are only a finite number of elements in the group. This means that we can eventually reach a power of $a$ that is equal to the identity element $e$.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $a^n = e$. This is because we can find a power of $a$ that is equal to the identity element $e$, and this power is a positive integer.\n\nThis completes our informal proof that there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $a^n = e$ for any given element $a$ in a finite group $G$.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\n\nopen Fintype Set Real Ideal Polynomial\nopen scoped BigOperators\n\n/-- If $G$ is a finite group, prove that, given $a \in G$, there is a positive integer $n$, depending on $a$, such that $a^n = e$.-/\n\ntheorem exercise_2_1_26 {G : Type*} [Group G]\n  [Fintype G] (a : G) : ∃ (n : ℕ), a ^ n = 1 :=\nbegin\n  let n := Fintype.card G,\n  use n,\n  rw [← pow_card_eq_one],\nend\n```",False

Since $G$ is a finite group, it is also a finite semigroup.\n\nNow, let's consider an arbitrary element $a$ in $G$. We know from the theorem ""Element has Idempotent Power in Finite Semigroup"" that for every element in a finite semigroup, there exists a power of that element which is idempotent. This means that there exists a positive integer $m$ such that $a^m = a^m \circ a^m$.\n\nSince $G$ is a group, we can use the property of groups that the identity element is the only idempotent element. This means that if $a^m = a^m \circ a^m$, then $a^m$ must be equal to the identity element $e$.\n\nNow, let's consider the powers of $a$. We know that $a^m = e$, and we also know that $a^{m+1} = a \circ a^m = a \circ e = a$. This means that the powers of $a$ repeat in a cycle of length $m$.\n\nSince $G$ is a finite group, the number of elements in $G$ is finite. This means that the cycle of powers of $a$ must also be finite.

Since $G$ is a finite group, the set of elements $\{a, a^2, a^3, \ldots\}$ must eventually repeat. This means that there exist integers $i$ and $j$ such that $a^i = a^j$ and $i > j$.\n\nNow, let's consider the difference $i - j$. Since $a^i = a^j$, we have $a^{i - j} = e$. This implies that the order of $a$ divides $i - j$.\n\nLet's denote the order of $a$ as $k$. Then, we have $k \mid (i - j)$. By the Division Theorem, we can write $i - j = qk + r$, where $q$ is an integer and $0 \le r < k$.\n\nSince $a^{i - j} = e$, we have $a^{qk + r} = e$. This implies that $a^r = (a^k)^q \cdot e = e$.

Since $\varphi$ is an automorphism, it preserves the group operation, and therefore $\varphi(yx) = \varphi(y)\varphi(x) = \varphi(y)x^{-1}$.\n\nNow, we have two expressions for $\varphi(xy)$: $x^{-1}\varphi(y)$ and $\varphi(y)x^{-1}$. Since these two expressions are equal, we can equate them to get $x^{-1}\varphi(y) = \varphi(y)x^{-1}$.\n\nSince $x$ is an arbitrary element of $G$, we can multiply both sides of the equation by $x$ to get $\varphi(y) = x\varphi(y)x^{-1}$. This equation shows that $\varphi(y)$ is invariant under conjugation by $x$.\n\nNow, let's consider the set of elements $x \in G$ such that $\varphi(y) = x\varphi(y)x^{-1}$. This set is a subgroup of $G$, since it is closed under multiplication and inversion. Moreover, this subgroup contains more than three-fourths of the elements of $G$, since $\varphi(x) = x^{-1}$ for more than three-fourths of the elements of $G$.\n\nSince the subgroup contains more than three-fourths of the elements of $G$, it must be the entire group $G$. Therefore, we have $\varphi(y) = x\varphi(y)x^{-1}$ for all $x,y \in G$.\n\nNow, let's consider an arbitrary element $y \in G$. We want to show that $\varphi(y) = y^{-1}$. To do this, we can use the fact that $\varphi(y) = x\varphi(y)x^{-1}$ for all $x,y \in G$. Since this equation holds for all $x,y \in G$, we can choose $x = y$ to get $\varphi(y) = y\varphi(y)y^{-1}$.\n\nNow, we can multiply both sides of the equation by $y^{-1}$ to get $\varphi(y)y^{-1} = \varphi(y)$. This equation shows that $\varphi(y)y^{-1} = \varphi(y)$.\n\nSince $\varphi(y)y^{-1} = \varphi(y)$, we can multiply both sides of the equation by $y$ to get $\varphi(y)y = \varphi(y)$. This equation shows that $\varphi(y)$ commutes with $y$.\n\nNow, let's consider an arbitrary element $z \in G$. We want to show that $\varphi(z) = z^{-1}$. To do this, we can use the fact that $\varphi(y)$ commutes with $y$ for all $y \in G$. Since this equation holds for all $y \in G$, we can choose $y = z$ to get $\varphi(z)z = \varphi(z)$.\n\nNow, we can multiply both sides of the equation by $z^{-1}$ to get $\varphi(z) = \varphi(z)z^{-1}$. This equation shows that $\varphi(z)$ commutes with $z^{-1}$.\n\nSince $\varphi(z)$ commutes with $z^{-1}$, we can multiply both sides of the equation by $z$ to get $\varphi(z) = \varphi(z)z$. This equation shows that $\varphi(z)$ commutes with $z$.\n\nNow, we have shown that $\varphi(y)$ commutes with $y$ for all $y \in G$, and $\varphi(z)$ commutes with $z$ for all $z \in G$. This implies that $\varphi$ is an inner automorphism of $G$, i.e., there exists an element $g \in G$ such that $\varphi(x) = gxg^{-1}$ for all $x \in G$.\n\nSince $\varphi(x) = x^{-1}$ for more than three-fourths of the elements of $G$, we can assume that $g$ is one of these elements. In this case, we have $\varphi(x) = gxg^{-1} = x^{-1}$ for all $x \in G$.\n\nTherefore, we have $\varphi(y) = y^{-1}$ for all $y \in G$, and $G$ is abelian.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\n\nopen Fintype Set Real Ideal Polynomial\nopen scoped BigOperators\n\ntheorem exercise_2_5_52 {G : Type*} [Group G] [Fintype G]\n  (φ : G ≃* G) {I : Finset G} (hI : ∀ x ∈ I, φ x = x⁻¹)\n  (hI1 : (0.75 : ℚ) * card G ≤ card I) :\n  ∀ x : G, φ x = x⁻¹ ∧ ∀ x y : G, x*y = y*x := by\n  have h1 : ∀ x : G, φ x = x⁻¹ := by\n    intro x\n    have h2 : x ∈ I ∨ x ∉ I := by apply Finset.mem_or_mem_of_mem_union\n    cases h2 with\n    | inl h2 =>\n      exact hI x h2\n    | inr h2 =>\n      have h3 : φ x = x := by\n        have h4 : φ x = x ∨ φ x ≠ x := by apply em\n        cases h4 with\n        | inl h4 => exact h4\n        | inr h4 =>\n          have h5 : x ∈ I := by\n            have h6 : φ x ∈ I := by apply hI\n            exact h6\n          contradiction\n      exact h3\n  have h2 : ∀ x y : G, x*y = y*x := by\n    intro x y\n    have h3 : φ (x*y) = φ x * φ y := by apply φ.map_mul\n    have h4 : φ (x*y) = (x*y)⁻¹ := by apply h1\n    have h5 : φ x * φ y = x⁻¹ * y⁻¹ := by\n      rw [h1 x, h1 y]\n    rw [h4, h5] at h3\n    exact h3\n  exact ⟨h1, h2⟩\n```",False

This implies that the intersection of $P$ and $Q$ contains only the identity element.\n\nWe also know that in $P \cup Q$, there are $q + p - 1$ elements. Since $p q \ge 2 q > q + p - 1$, there exists a non-identity element in $G$ that is not in $P$ or $Q$. This non-identity element must have order $p q$, as it is not contained in either $P$ or $Q$.\n\nNow, let's consider two nonabelian groups $G_1$ and $G_2$ of order $pq$.

This implies that the number of elements in $P \cup Q$ is $q + p - 1$.\n\nSince $p > q$, we have $pq \ge 2q > q + p - 1$.

A subgroup $A$ of $G$ is normal if for all $g \in G$ and $a \in A$, we have $gag^{-1} \in A$. This means that the conjugate of any element in $A$ by any element in $G$ is still in $A$.\n\nNow, let's consider the element $b \in G$ of prime order $p$. Since $b \not\in A$, we know that $b$ is not in the normal subgroup $A$. We want to show that the intersection of $A$ and the subgroup generated by $b$ is trivial, i.e., $A \cap (b) = (e)$.\n\nTo do this, let's assume that there is an element $x \in A \cap (b)$. This means that $x$ is in both $A$ and the subgroup generated by $b$.

In particular, this means that $gb^kg^{-1} \in A$.\n\nBut $gb^kg^{-1} = (gbg^{-1})^k$, and since $b$ has prime order $p$, we know that $b^p = e$. Therefore, $(gbg^{-1})^p = e$, which means that $gbg^{-1}$ has order $p$.\n\nSince $gbg^{-1}$ has order $p$, and $b$ has order $p$, we know that $gbg^{-1} = b$ or $gbg^{-1} = b^{-1}$. But since $b \not\in A$, we know that $gbg^{-1} \not\in A$. Therefore, we must have $gbg^{-1} = b^{-1}$.\n\nNow, let's consider the element $b^{-1}$. Since $b^{-1} = (gbg^{-1})^{-1}$, and $gbg^{-1} \in G$, we know that $b^{-1} \in G$.

In other words, for any $a \in A$ and any $g \in G$, we have $gag^{-1} \in A$.\n\nNow, let's consider the subgroup $(b)$ generated by $b$.

This means that for any $a \in A$ and any $g \in G$, we have $gag^{-1} \in A$.\n\nNow, let's consider the element $b \in G$ of prime order $p$. Since $b \not\in A$, we know that $b$ does not belong to the normal subgroup $A$. Our goal is to show that the intersection of $A$ and $(b)$ is the trivial subgroup $(e)$.\n\nTo do this, let's assume that there exists an element $x \in A \cap (b)$. This means that $x \in A$ and $x \in (b)$. Since $x \in (b)$, we know that $x$ can be written as a power of $b$, say $x = b^k$ for some integer $k$.\n\nNow, since $x \in A$ and $A$ is a normal subgroup of $G$, we know that $x$ is conjugate to any other element of $A$. In particular, we can conjugate $x$ by $b$ to get $bxb^{-1}$. Since $x = b^k$, we have $bxb^{-1} = bb^kb^{-1} = b^{k+1}$.\n\nBut wait, we know that $b$ has prime order $p$, so $b^p = e$. This means that $b^{k+1} = b^p \cdot b^k = e \cdot b^k = b^k$. Therefore, we have $bxb^{-1} = b^k$.\n\nNow, since $A$ is a normal subgroup of $G$, we know that $bxb^{-1} \in A$.

This means that $A \cap (b)$ contains all powers of $b$, since $b^k$ is a power of $b$.\n\nBut wait, we know that $b$ has prime order $p$, so the only powers of $b$ are $e$ and $b$. Therefore, we have $A \cap (b) = \{e, b\}$.\n\nBut this is a contradiction, since we assumed that $A \cap (b)$ is a subgroup of $A$.

To do this, we can use the fact that $P$ is a normal subgroup of $G$. Since $P$ is normal in $G$, we know that $\varphi(P) = P$ if and only if $\varphi(p) = p$ for all $p \in P$.\n\nBut this is where the key insight comes in. Since $P$ is a $p$-Sylow subgroup of $G$, we know that $P$ is a cyclic group of order $p^k$. As a cyclic group, $P$ has a generator $g$ such that $P = \langle g \rangle$. Now, let's consider the automorphism $\varphi$ of $G$. Since $\varphi$ is an automorphism, we know that $\varphi(g) = g^m$ for some integer $m$.\n\nNow, let's consider the order of $\varphi(g)$. Since $\varphi(g) = g^m$, we know that the order of $\varphi(g)$ is equal to the order of $g^m$. But the order of $g^m$ is equal to the order of $g$ divided by the greatest common divisor of $m$ and the order of $g$. Since $P$ is a cyclic group of order $p^k$, we know that the order of $g$ is equal to $p^k$. Therefore, the order of $\varphi(g)$ is equal to $p^k$ divided by the greatest common divisor of $m$ and $p^k$.\n\nBut this is where the key insight comes in. Since $p$ is a prime number, we know that the greatest common divisor of $m$ and $p^k$ is either $1$ or $p$. If the greatest common divisor is $1$, then the order of $\varphi(g)$ is equal to $p^k$. But this means that $\varphi(g)$ is a generator of $P$, and therefore $\varphi(P) = P$. On the other hand, if the greatest common divisor is $p$, then the order of $\varphi(g)$ is equal to $p^{k-1}$. But this means that $\varphi(g)$ is not a generator of $P$, and therefore $\varphi(P) \neq P$.\n\nHowever, this is a contradiction, since we assumed that $\varphi(P) = P$. Therefore, we must have that the greatest common divisor of $m$ and $p^k$ is $1$. This means that the order of $\varphi(g)$ is equal to $p^k$, and therefore $\varphi(P) = P$.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that $\varphi(P) = P$ for every automorphism $\varphi$ of $G$.

It consists of all possible permutations of three elements, and its Cayley table is given. We also know that $S_3$ is isomorphic to the dihedral group $D_3$, which has a group presentation and a Cayley table.\n\nNow, let's consider the group $T$. We can represent each matrix in $T$ as a permutation of the elements in the field $\mathbb{Z}_2$. Since the determinant of each matrix is non-zero, we can think of each matrix as a linear transformation that preserves the orientation of the plane.\n\nWe can start by identifying the elements of $T$ with the permutations in $S_3$. For example, the identity matrix corresponds to the identity permutation, and the matrix with entries (1, 0; 0, 1) corresponds to the permutation (1 2 3).\n\nNext, we need to define a homomorphism $\phi: T \to S_3$ that maps each matrix in $T$ to a permutation in $S_3$. We can do this by considering the action of each matrix on the elements of the field $\mathbb{Z}_2$. For example, the matrix with entries (1, 0; 0, 1) maps the element 0 to 0 and the element 1 to 1, so it corresponds to the permutation (1 2 3).\n\nWe can continue this process to define the homomorphism $\phi$ for all elements of $T$. We need to make sure that the homomorphism is bijective, meaning that it is both injective and surjective.\n\nTo show that the homomorphism $\phi$ is injective, we can use the fact that the determinant of each matrix in $T$ is non-zero. This means that each matrix is invertible, and the homomorphism $\phi$ preserves the group operation.\n\nTo show that the homomorphism $\phi$ is surjective, we can use the fact that $S_3$ has six elements, and $T$ also has six elements. We can show that each permutation in $S_3$ corresponds to a unique matrix in $T$, and vice versa.\n\nOnce we have established the bijective homomorphism $\phi$, we can conclude that $T$ is isomorphic to $S_3$. This means that the two groups have the same structure and properties, and we can use the isomorphism to transfer results and theorems between the two groups.\n\nIn summary, we have shown that the group $T$ of $2\times 2$ matrices with entries in the field $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and non-zero determinant is isomorphic to the symmetric group $S_3$.

We can write it as a product of elementary matrices:\n\n$$A = E_1 E_2 \cdots E_n$$\n\nwhere each $E_i$ is an elementary matrix. We can then map each $E_i$ to a transposition in $S_3$:\n\n$$E_i \mapsto (i \, j)$$\n\nwhere $(i \, j)$ is the transposition that swaps the elements $i$ and $j$.\n\nNow, we can map the product of elementary matrices to the product of transpositions:\n\n$$A \mapsto (i_1 \, j_1) (i_2 \, j_2) \cdots (i_n \, j_n)$$\n\nThis mapping is a homomorphism because it preserves the group operation:\n\n$$(A_1 A_2) \mapsto ((i_1 \, j_1) (i_2 \, j_2) \cdots (i_n \, j_n)) ((k_1 \, l_1) (k_2 \, l_2) \cdots (k_m \, l_m))$$\n\n$$= (i_1 \, j_1) (i_2 \, j_2) \cdots (i_n \, j_n) (k_1 \, l_1) (k_2 \, l_2) \cdots (k_m \, l_m)$$\n\n$$= (A_1 A_2)$$\n\nThis homomorphism is also bijective because each matrix in $T$ can be uniquely represented as a product of elementary matrices, and each transposition in $S_3$ can be uniquely represented as a product of elementary matrices.\n\nTherefore, we have established a bijective homomorphism between the group $T$ and the symmetric group $S_3$, which implies that they are isomorphic.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\n\nopen Fintype Set Real Ideal Polynomial\nopen scoped BigOperators\n\n-- Define the group T as the group of 2x2 matrices with entries in ZMod 2 and non-zero determinant\ndef T : Type := Matrix.GeneralLinearGroup (Fin 2) (ZMod 2)\n\n-- Define the symmetric group S_3\ndef S3 : Type := Equiv.Perm (Fin 3)\n\n-- Define the isomorphism between T and S_3\ndef exercise_4_1_34 : S3 ≃* T :=\n{\n  -- Define the forward function that maps a permutation in S_3 to a matrix in T\n  toFun := fun p =>\n  {\n    -- Define the matrix corresponding to the permutation p\n    val := \n    {\n      -- Define the entries of the matrix\n      toFun := fun i j => if i = 0 then if j = 0 then 1 else 0 else if j = 0 then 0 else 1,\n      -- Prove that the matrix is invertible\n      inv := \n      {\n        toFun := fun i j => if i = 0 then if j = 0 then 1 else 0 else if j = 0 then 0 else 1,\n        -- Prove that the inverse is correct\n        inv_apply := sorry,\n        apply_inv_apply := sorry\n      },\n      -- Prove that the matrix is a homomorphism\n      map_mul' := sorry,\n      map_one' := sorry\n    },\n    -- Prove that the matrix is a homomorphism\n    map_mul' := sorry,\n    map_one' := sorry\n  },\n  -- Define the inverse function that maps a matrix in T to a permutation in S_3\n  invFun := fun m =>\n  {\n    -- Define the permutation corresponding to the matrix m\n    toFun := fun i => if i = 0 then 0 else if i = 1 then 1 else 2,\n    -- Prove that the permutation is a homomorphism\n    inv := \n    {\n      toFun := fun i => if i = 0 then 0 else if i = 1 then 1 else 2,\n      inv_apply := sorry,\n      apply_inv_apply := sorry\n    },\n    -- Prove that the permutation is a homomorphism\n    map_mul' := sorry,\n    map_one' := sorry\n  },\n  -- Prove that the forward and inverse functions are inverses of each other\n  left_inv := sorry,\n  right_inv := sorry,\n  -- Prove that the forward function is a homomorphism\n  map_mul' := sorry,\n  map_one' := sorry\n}\n```",False

In other words, $a$ is a quadratic residue if there exists an integer $x$ such that $x^2 \equiv a \pmod p$.\n\nNow, let's consider the numbers $1, 2, \ldots, p - 1$. We can pair these numbers up in the following way: for each number $r$, we can pair it with its negative, $-r$. Since $p$ is an odd prime, we know that $-r \not\equiv r \pmod p$ for any $r \neq 0$. Therefore, each pair of numbers $r$ and $-r$ is distinct $\mod p$.\n\nSince there are $p - 1$ numbers in the list $1, 2, \ldots, p - 1$, we can pair them up in $p - 1$ pairs. However, we need to be careful not to count the number $0$ twice, since $0$ is not a quadratic residue $\mod p$. Therefore, we can pair up the numbers $1, 2, \ldots, p - 1$ in the following way:\n\n$$1^2 \equiv (p - 1)^2 \pmod p$$\n$$2^2 \equiv (p - 2)^2 \pmod p$$\n$$\vdots$$\n$$\left(\frac{p - 1}{2}\right)^2 \equiv \left(\frac{p + 1}{2}\right)^2 \pmod p$$\n\nAs we can see, each quadratic residue is paired up with another quadratic residue, and each pair is distinct $\mod p$. Therefore, there are exactly $(p - 1)/2$ quadratic residues $\mod p$.\n\nSince there are $p - 1$ numbers in the list $1, 2, \ldots, p - 1$, and we have already counted $(p - 1)/2$ of them as quadratic residues, we know that the remaining $(p - 1)/2$ numbers must be quadratic nonresidues $\mod p$.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that $(p - 1)/2$ of the numbers $1, 2, \ldots, p - 1$ are quadratic residues and $(p - 1)/2$ are quadratic nonresidues $\mod p$.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\n\nopen Fintype Set Real Ideal Polynomial\nopen scoped BigOperators\n\n/-- Show that $(p - 1)/2$ of the numbers $1, 2, \ldots, p - 1$ are quadratic residues and $(p - 1)/2$ are quadratic nonresidues $\mod p$.-/\ntheorem exercise_4_4_9 (p : ℕ) (hp : Nat.Prime p) :\n  (∃ S : Finset (ZMod p), S.card = (p-1)/2 ∧ ∃ x : ZMod p, x^2 = p) ∧\n  (∃ S : Finset (ZMod p), S.card = (p-1)/2 ∧ ¬ ∃ x : ZMod p, x^2 = p) :=\n  sorry\n```",False

",0,1,96623,"# Informal Proof:\n\nTo show that $p(x)$ and $q(x)$ are irreducible in $F[x]$ and that the fields $F[x]/(p(x))$ and $F[x]/(q(x))$ are isomorphic, we need to understand the properties of polynomials in a field and the concept of irreducibility.\n\nFirst, let's recall that a polynomial $f(x)$ in a field $F$ is said to be irreducible if it cannot be expressed as a product of two non-constant polynomials in $F[x]$. In other words, if $f(x) = g(x)h(x)$, where $g(x)$ and $h(x)$ are non-constant polynomials in $F[x]$, then $f(x)$ is reducible.\n\nNow, let's consider the polynomials $p(x) = x^3 - 2$ and $q(x) = x^3 + 2$ in $F[x]$, where $F = \mathbb{Z}_7$. To show that these polynomials are irreducible, we need to show that they cannot be expressed as a product of two non-constant polynomials in $F[x]$.\n\nSuppose, for the sake of contradiction, that $p(x)$ is reducible. Then, there exist non-constant polynomials $g(x)$ and $h(x)$ in $F[x]$ such that $p(x) = g(x)h(x)$. Since the degree of $p(x)$ is 3, the degrees of $g(x)$ and $h(x)$ must be 1 and 2, respectively. However, this is impossible, since $F[x]$ is a field, and therefore, it has no zero divisors. Hence, $p(x)$ is irreducible.\n\nSimilarly, we can show that $q(x)$ is also irreducible.\n\nNext, we need to show that the fields $F[x]/(p(x))$ and $F[x]/(q(x))$ are isomorphic. To do this, we need to find an isomorphism between these two fields.\n\nLet $\phi: F[x] \to F[x]$ be the homomorphism defined by $\phi(f(x)) = f(x) + (p(x))$ for all $f(x) \in F[x]$. Then, $\phi$ is a ring homomorphism, and its kernel is the ideal $(p(x))$.\n\nBy the First Isomorphism Theorem, we have that $F[x]/(p(x)) \cong \phi(F[x])$. Similarly, we have that $F[x]/(q(x)) \cong \psi(F[x])$, where $\psi: F[x] \to F[x]$ is the homomorphism defined by $\psi(f(x)) = f(x) + (q(x))$ for all $f(x) \in F[x]$.\n\nNow, we need to show that $\phi(F[x])$ and $\psi(F[x])$ are isomorphic. To do this, we need to find an isomorphism between these two rings.\n\nLet $\theta: \phi(F[x]) \to \psi(F[x])$ be the map defined by $\theta(f(x) + (p(x))) = f(x) + (q(x))$ for all $f(x) \in F[x]$. Then, $\theta$ is a ring homomorphism, and it is clearly bijective.\n\nTherefore, we have that $\phi(F[x]) \cong \psi(F[x])$, and hence, $F[x]/(p(x)) \cong F[x]/(q(x))$.\n\nThis completes the proof that $p(x)$ and $q(x)$ are irreducible in $F[x]$ and that the fields $F[x]/(p(x))$ and $F[x]/(q(x))$ are isomorphic.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\n\nopen Fintype Set Real Ideal Polynomial\nopen scoped BigOperators\n\ntheorem exercise_4_5_23 {p q: Polynomial (ZMod 7)}\n  (hp : p = X^3 - 2) (hq : q = X^3 + 2) :\n  Irreducible p ∧ Irreducible q ∧\n  (Nonempty $ Polynomial (ZMod 7) ⧸ span ({p} : Set $ Polynomial $ ZMod 7) ≃+*\n  Polynomial (ZMod 7) ⧸ span ({q} : Set $ Polynomial $ ZMod 7)) := by\n  /-\n  To show that \( p(x) = x^3 - 2 \) and \( q(x) = x^3 + 2 \) are irreducible in \( \mathbb{Z}_7[x] \) and that the fields \( \mathbb{Z}_7[x]/(p(x)) \) and \( \mathbb{Z}_7[x]/(q(x)) \) are isomorphic, we proceed as follows:\n  1. **Irreducibility of \( p(x) \) and \( q(x) \)**:\n     - We need to show that \( p(x) \) and \( q(x) \) cannot be factored into non-constant polynomials in \( \mathbb{Z}_7[x] \).\n     - Since \( \mathbb{Z}_7 \) is a field, any polynomial of degree 3 is irreducible if it has no roots in \( \mathbb{Z}_7 \).\n     - Checking the roots of \( p(x) = x^3 - 2 \) and \( q(x) = x^3 + 2 \) in \( \mathbb{Z}_7 \):\n       - For \( p(x) \), we solve \( x^3 - 2 = 0 \).

But then $a - b$ must also be a multiple of $q(x)$, since $q(x)$ is also irreducible. Therefore, we have:\n\n$$a - b \in (q(x))$$\n\nwhich shows that $a + (q(x)) = b + (q(x))$. Hence, $\phi$ is well-defined.\n\nWe also need to show that $\phi$ is a homomorphism, meaning that it preserves the operations of addition and multiplication. Let's take two elements $a + (p(x))$ and $b + (p(x))$ in $F[x]/(p(x))$.

Specifically, $p = 2$ divides the constant term of $f(x)$, which is $2$, but $p^2 = 4$ does not divide the leading coefficient of $f(x)$, which is $1$.\n\nTherefore, by the Schönemann-Eisenstein Theorem, we can conclude that $f(x) = x^3 + 3x + 2$ is irreducible in $Q[x]$. This means that $f(x)$ cannot be factored into the product of two non-constant polynomials with rational coefficients.\n\nTo see why this is the case, let's assume that $f(x)$ can be factored into the product of two non-constant polynomials, say $g(x)$ and $h(x)$. Then we can write $f(x) = g(x)h(x)$, where $g(x)$ and $h(x)$ are both non-constant polynomials with rational coefficients.\n\nNow, let's consider the constant term of $f(x)$, which is $2$. Since $f(x) = g(x)h(x)$, the constant term of $f(x)$ must be equal to the product of the constant terms of $g(x)$ and $h(x)$. Let's call the constant term of $g(x)$ $b_0$ and the constant term of $h(x)$ $c_0$. Then we have $2 = b_0c_0$.\n\nSince $p = 2$ divides the constant term of $f(x)$, we know that $p = 2$ divides $b_0c_0$. But since $p^2 = 4$ does not divide the leading coefficient of $f(x)$, we know that $p = 2$ does not divide the leading coefficient of $g(x)$ or the leading coefficient of $h(x)$.\n\nLet's say that the leading coefficient of $g(x)$ is $b_e$ and the leading coefficient of $h(x)$ is $c_f$.

This means that both $a$ and $b$ satisfy the equation $x^{p^n} - x = 0$. \n\nWe can rewrite this equation as $(x - a)(x - b) = 0$. However, since $a$ and $b$ are distinct, we can't have a common factor of $(x - a)$ and $(x - b)$. \n\nThis leads us to consider the polynomial $x^{p^n} - x$ as a product of linear factors. Since the characteristic of the field is $p$, we can use the fact that $x^{p^n} - x$ can be factored as $(x - 1)(x^{p^n - 1} + x^{p^n - 2} + \cdots + x + 1)$.\n\nNow, let's consider the roots of the polynomial $x^{p^n} - x$.

Therefore, the image of $A$ under $f$ is compact.\n\nSince $f$ attains its bounds (as shown in the theorem ""Continuous Image of Compact Space is Compact: Corollary 3""), there exists $\alpha \in A$ such that $f(\alpha) = \inf_{a \in A} f(a)$. \n\nThis means that $d(\alpha, B) = \inf_{a \in A} d(a, B)$, which implies that $d(\alpha, B) \leq d(a, B)$ for all $a \in A$.\n\nNow, let $b_0 \in B$ be any point in $B$.

A constant function is one where the value of the function does not change, regardless of the input.\n\nGiven that $|f(t)-f(x)| \leq|t-x|^{2}$ for all $t, x$, we can see that the difference between the function values at any two points is bounded by the square of the difference between the input values. This suggests that the function values are not changing rapidly, but rather are changing in a very controlled manner.\n\nHowever, if the function is not constant, then there must exist two points $t_1$ and $t_2$ such that $f(t_1) \neq f(t_2)$. Let's assume that $f(t_1) > f(t_2)$, without loss of generality. Then, we can consider the difference $|f(t_1)-f(t_2)|$.\n\nUsing the given inequality, we have $|f(t_1)-f(t_2)| \leq|t_1-t_2|^{2}$. However, since $f(t_1) > f(t_2)$, we know that $|f(t_1)-f(t_2)| = f(t_1)-f(t_2)$. Therefore, we have $f(t_1)-f(t_2) \leq|t_1-t_2|^{2}$.\n\nNow, let's consider the function $g(t) = f(t) - f(t_2)$. Then, we have $g(t_1) = f(t_1) - f(t_2) \leq|t_1-t_2|^{2}$.\n\nHowever, since $f$ is a real-valued function, we know that $g(t)$ is also a real-valued function. Therefore, we can apply the given inequality to $g(t)$, which gives us $|g(t)-g(x)| \leq|t-x|^{2}$ for all $t, x$.\n\nIn particular, we can choose $x = t_2$ and $t = t_1$, which gives us $|g(t_1)-g(t_2)| \leq|t_1-t_2|^{2}$. However, since $g(t_1) = f(t_1) - f(t_2)$ and $g(t_2) = 0$, we have $|g(t_1)-g(t_2)| = |f(t_1)-f(t_2)|$.\n\nTherefore, we have $|f(t_1)-f(t_2)| \leq|t_1-t_2|^{2}$.

To do this, we can use a clever trick to rewrite the terms of the series in a way that makes it easier to compare to the $p$-series.\n\nLet's consider the partial sum $s_{2^N}$, which is given by:\n\n$$s_{2^N} = 1 + \frac{1}{2^p} + \frac{1}{3^p} + \dotsb + \frac{1}{N^p}$$\n\nWe can rewrite this sum by grouping the terms into pairs, like this:\n\n$$s_{2^N} = 1 + \left(\frac{1}{2^p} + \frac{1}{3^p}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{4^p} + \frac{1}{5^p} + \frac{1}{6^p} + \frac{1}{7^p}\right) + \dotsb + \left(\frac{1}{2^{(N-1)p}} + \dotsb + \frac{1}{(2^N-1)^p}\right)$$\n\nNow, we can see that each pair of terms has a similar structure to the $p$-series. In particular, each pair has a sum that is at least as large as the corresponding pair in the $p$-series, but with a smaller denominator.\n\nTo make this more precise, let's consider the sum of each pair:\n\n$$\left(\frac{1}{2^p} + \frac{1}{3^p}\right) \geq \frac{2}{2^p}$$\n\n$$\left(\frac{1}{4^p} + \frac{1}{5^p} + \frac{1}{6^p} + \frac{1}{7^p}\right) \geq \frac{4}{4^p}$$\n\n$$\dotsb$$\n\n$$\left(\frac{1}{2^{(N-1)p}} + \dotsb + \frac{1}{(2^N-1)^p}\right) \geq \frac{2^{N-1}}{2^{(N-1)p}}$$\n\nNow, we can sum up these inequalities to get a bound on the partial sum $s_{2^N}$:\n\n$$s_{2^N} \leq 1 + \frac{2}{2^p} + \frac{4}{4^p} + \dotsb + \frac{2^{N-1}}{2^{(N-1)p}}$$\n\nThis is a geometric series with a common ratio of $1/2^{p-1}$, and we can use the formula for the sum of a geometric series to get a bound on the partial sum:\n\n$$s_{2^N} \leq \frac{1 - (1/2^{p-1})^N}{1 - 1/2^{p-1}}$$\n\nNow, we can take the limit as $N$ goes to infinity to get a bound on the entire series:\n\n$$\sum 1/k(\log(k))^p \leq \frac{1}{1 - 1/2^{p-1}}$$\n\nThis shows that the series is bounded above by a constant, which implies that it converges.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that the series $\sum 1/k(\log(k))^p$ converges when $p > 1$.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\n\nopen Filter Real Function\nopen scoped Topology\n\n/-- Prove that $\sum 1/k(\log(k))^p$ converges when $p > 1$.-/\ntheorem exercise_3_63a (p : ℝ) (f : ℕ → ℝ) (hp : p > 1)\n  (h : f = λ (k : ℕ) => (1 : ℝ) / (k * (log k) ^ p)) :\n  ∃ l, Tendsto f atTop (𝓝 l) :=\nbegin\n  -- We will show that the series converges by comparing it to the p-series.\n  -- Define the partial sum of the series.\n  let s : ℕ → ℝ := λ N, ∑ k in Finset.range N, f k,\n  -- We need to show that the partial sum converges.\n  -- Consider the partial sum up to 2^N.\n  have h_partial_sum : ∀ N, s (2^N) ≤ ∑ k in Finset.range (2^N), 1 / (k : ℝ) ^ p,\n  { intro N,\n    -- We will use the fact that the series ∑ 1/k^p converges for p > 1.\n    -- We can rewrite the partial sum by grouping terms.\n    calc s (2^N)\n        = ∑ k in Finset.range (2^N), f k : rfl\n    ... ≤ ∑ k in Finset.range (2^N), 1 / (k : ℝ) ^ p : by {\n      apply Finset.sum_le_sum,\n      intros k hk,\n      -- Each term in the series is at most 1 / k^p.\n      rw [h],\n      exact div_le_div_of_le_left (by norm_num) (by norm_num) (by norm_num),\n    }\n  },\n  -- Now we need to show that the partial sum converges.\n  -- We know that the p-series ∑ 1/k^p converges for p > 1.\n  -- Therefore, the partial sum s (2^N) also converges.\n  have h_converges : ∃ l, Tendsto (λ N, ∑ k in Finset.range (2^N), 1 / (k : ℝ) ^ p) atTop (𝓝 l),\n  { -- The p-series converges for p > 1.\n    exact exists_tendsto_of_summable_norm (summable_one_div_pow_of_le hp),\n  },\n  -- Since the partial sum s (2^N) is bounded above by a convergent series, it also converges.\n  obtain ⟨l, hl⟩ := h_converges,\n  use l,\n  -- We need to show that the original series f converges to the same limit.\n  -- This follows from the fact that the partial sums are bounded above by the convergent series.\n  exact tendsto_of_tendsto_of_tendsto_of_le_of_le' tendsto_const_nhds hl (eventually_of_forall h_partial_sum) (eventually_of_forall (λ N, le_refl _)),\nend\n```",False

Suppose $f$ is uniformly continuous on $[a, b]$. This means that for any $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a $\delta > 0$ such that for all $s, t \in [a, b]$, if $|s - t| < \delta$, then $|f(s) - f(t)| < \epsilon$. We can define a function $\mu: (0, \infty) \rightarrow (0, \infty)$ by $\mu(\delta) = \epsilon$. Since $f$ is uniformly continuous, we know that $\mu(\delta) \rightarrow 0$ as $\delta \rightarrow 0$. This is because for any $\epsilon > 0$, we can find a $\delta > 0$ such that $\mu(\delta) < \epsilon$, and as $\delta \rightarrow 0$, we can make $\mu(\delta) \rightarrow 0$ arbitrarily close to $0$.

Since a field is a special type of ring, we can view $\phi$ as a ring homomorphism from $F$ to $S$. \n\nNow, according to the theorem, we have two possibilities: either $\phi$ is a monomorphism (injective) or $\phi$ is the zero homomorphism. \n\nIf $\phi$ is the zero homomorphism, then for every element $a \in F$, $\map \phi a = 0_S$. This implies that every element in the domain field $F$ is mapped to the zero element in the codomain field $S$. \n\nHowever, this is a contradiction because a field homomorphism must preserve the multiplicative identity, i.e., $\map \phi 1_F = 1_S$, where $1_F$ and $1_S$ are the multiplicative identities in $F$ and $S$, respectively. \n\nTherefore, the zero homomorphism possibility is ruled out, and we are left with the possibility that $\phi$ is a monomorphism (injective). \n\nTo see why this is the case, let's consider two distinct elements $a, b \in F$.

We are given a homomorphism $\phi: F \to S$. Our goal is to show that $\phi$ is injective.\n\nFirst, recall that a field is a special type of ring where every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse. This property is crucial in our proof.\n\nWe know that $\phi$ is a ring homomorphism, which means it preserves the operations of addition and multiplication. In other words, for any $a, b \in F$, we have:\n\n$\phi(a +_F b) = \phi(a) +_S \phi(b)$\n\nand\n\n$\phi(a \circ b) = \phi(a) * \phi(b)$\n\nNow, let's assume that $\phi$ is not injective. This means there exist two distinct elements $a, b \in F$ such that $\phi(a) = \phi(b)$. We want to show that this leads to a contradiction.\n\nSince $a$ and $b$ are distinct, we know that $a \neq b$. We can use this fact to our advantage.\n\nConsider the element $a -_F b \in F$. Since $a \neq b$, we have $a -_F b \neq 0_F$. Now, let's apply the homomorphism $\phi$ to this element:\n\n$\phi(a -_F b) = \phi(a) -_S \phi(b)$\n\nUsing the fact that $\phi(a) = \phi(b)$, we can simplify this expression:\n\n$\phi(a -_F b) = \phi(b) -_S \phi(b) = 0_S$\n\nThis shows that the image of $a -_F b$ under $\phi$ is the zero element in $S$.\n\nNow, recall that $a -_F b \neq 0_F$. Since $\phi$ is a homomorphism, we know that $\phi(a -_F b) \neq 0_S$ if and only if $a -_F b \neq 0_F$. This is because a homomorphism preserves the zero element.\n\nHowever, we have just shown that $\phi(a -_F b) = 0_S$, which contradicts the fact that $a -_F b \neq 0_F$.\n\nThis contradiction shows that our initial assumption - that $\phi$ is not injective - must be false. Therefore, we conclude that $\phi$ is indeed injective.\n\nThis completes our informal proof that every homomorphism of fields is injective.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\n\nopen Function Fintype Subgroup Ideal Polynomial Submodule Zsqrtd\nopen scoped BigOperators\n\nopen RingHom\n\n/-- Prove that every homomorphism of fields is injective.-/\ntheorem exercise_3_2_7 {F : Type*} [Field F] {G : Type*} [Field G]\n    (φ : F →+* G) : Injective φ :=\n  -- We use the fact that a ring homomorphism from a field is either a monomorphism or the zero homomorphism.\n  -- Since a field has no zero divisors, a homomorphism that is not injective would imply a zero divisor, which is a contradiction.\n  -- Therefore, the homomorphism must be injective.\n  fun x y h => by\n    have h' : φ x = φ y := h\n    exact φ.injective h'\n```",True

exercise_10_6_7,"/-- Prove that every nonzero ideal in the ring of Gauss integers contains a nonzero integer.-/
",0,1,139175,"# Informal Proof:\n\nTo prove that every nonzero ideal in the ring of Gauss integers contains a nonzero integer, we can start by considering an arbitrary nonzero ideal $J$ in the ring of Gauss integers, denoted as $\Z \sqbrk i$. Our goal is to show that $J$ contains a nonzero integer.\n\nLet's assume that $J$ is a nonzero ideal in $\Z \sqbrk i$. This means that $J$ is a subset of $\Z \sqbrk i$ that is closed under addition and multiplication by elements of $\Z \sqbrk i$. Since $J$ is nonzero, it must contain at least one element, say $d$, that is not equal to zero.\n\nNow, let's consider the modulus of $d$, denoted as $\cmod d$. We can use the fact that the ring of Gauss integers is an integral domain, which means that it has no zero divisors. This implies that if $d$ is not equal to zero, then $\cmod d$ is also not equal to zero.\n\nNext, we can use the fact that the ring of Gauss integers is a principal ideal domain (PID), which means that every ideal in the ring can be generated by a single element. In this case, we can use the Division Theorem to show that $J$ can be generated by the element $d$.\n\nTo do this, we can use the fact that the modulus of any element in $J$ is less than or equal to the modulus of $d$. This is because if we have an element $a$ in $J$, then we can use the Division Theorem to write $a = qd + r$, where $q$ and $r$ are elements of $\Z \sqbrk i$ and $\cmod r < \cmod d$. This implies that the modulus of $a$ is less than or equal to the modulus of $d$.\n\nNow, let's consider the element $d$ in $J$.

Let's denote this set as $S$. Since $I$ is a nonzero ideal, $S$ is nonempty.\n\nWe can now consider an arbitrary element $d$ in $S$. By definition, $d$ has the smallest possible modulus among all elements in $I$. We can assume without loss of generality that $\cmod d \ge 1$, since if $\cmod d = 0$, then $d$ would be the zero element, which is not allowed in an ideal.\n\nNow, consider an arbitrary element $a$ in $I$.

Since $a$ was an arbitrary element in $I$, this means that every element in $I$ can be written as a multiple of $d$.\n\nNow, consider the ideal generated by $d$, denoted as $\ideal d$. Since every element in $I$ can be written as a multiple of $d$, we know that $I \subseteq \ideal d$.\n\nOn the other hand, since $d$ is an element of $I$, we know that $\ideal d \subseteq I$. Therefore, we have $I = \ideal d$.\n\nSince $d$ is a nonzero element in $I$, this means that $I$ contains a nonzero integer.

In this context, $a$ divides $b$ if there exists a Gauss integer $c$ such that $b = ac$.\n\nNow, let's consider the relationship between the ring of Gauss integers and the ring of integers. The ring of Gauss integers is an extension of the ring of integers, meaning that every integer is also a Gauss integer. This implies that if $a$ and $b$ are integers, then they are also Gauss integers.\n\nGiven that $a$ divides $b$ in the ring of Gauss integers, we can express this relationship as $b = ac$ for some Gauss integer $c$. Since $a$ and $b$ are integers, we can also express this relationship as $b = ac$ for some integer $c$. This is because the ring of integers is a subset of the ring of Gauss integers.\n\nNow, we can use the fact that the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers is the same in both the ring of integers and the ring of Gauss integers. This means that if $d$ is the GCD of $a$ and $b$ in the ring of integers, then $d$ is also the GCD of $a$ and $b$ in the ring of Gauss integers.\n\nUsing the Common Divisor Divides GCD theorem, we know that if $c$ is a common divisor of $a$ and $b$ in the ring of integers, then $c$ divides the GCD of $a$ and $b$.

We can list these primes as $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$. Now, consider the number $N = 4p_1p_2\cdots p_n + 1$.

Then, it must have a prime factor $q$. Since $N$ is not divisible by any of the primes $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$, we know that $q$ is not equal to any of these primes. Moreover, since $N$ is congruent to $1$ (modulo $4$), we know that $q$ must be congruent to $1$ or $3$ (modulo $4$).\n\nHowever, if $q$ is congruent to $1$ (modulo $4$), then it is not a prime congruent to $-1$ (modulo $4$), which contradicts our assumption that $q$ is a prime factor of $N$.

We are interested in the specific root $\frac{-1 + \sqrt{3}i}{2}$.\n\nTo find the cube of this root, we can simply raise it to the power of 3. This means we need to multiply the root by itself three times.\n\nLet's start by squaring the root: $\left(\frac{-1 + \sqrt{3}i}{2}\right)^2$. To do this, we can use the formula $(a + bi)^2 = a^2 + 2abi + (bi)^2 = a^2 + 2abi - b^2$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers.\n\nApplying this formula to our root, we get: $\left(\frac{-1}{2}\right)^2 + 2\left(\frac{-1}{2}\right)\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}i}{2}\right) - \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}i}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4} - \frac{\sqrt{3}i}{2} - \frac{3i^2}{4}$.

We are given that $V$ is finite dimensional, which means that we can choose a basis for $V$. Let's denote this basis by $\{v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n\}$.\n\nNow, let's consider the linear transformation $T$. We can write the matrix representation of $T$ with respect to the basis $\{v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n\}$ as $[T]$. The columns of this matrix represent the images of the basis vectors under $T$. \n\nWe can then consider the null space of $T$ and find a basis for it. Let's denote this basis by $\{u_1, u_2, \ldots, u_k\}$. We can then extend this basis to a basis for all of $V$ by adding vectors that are not in the null space of $T$. Let's denote this extended basis by $\{u_1, u_2, \ldots, u_k, v_{k+1}, \ldots, v_n\}$.\n\nNow, let's define the subspace $U$ to be the span of the vectors $\{u_1, u_2, \ldots, u_k\}$. This means that $U$ is the set of all linear combinations of these vectors. \n\nWe can then show that $U \cap \operatorname{null} T=\{0\}$. Suppose that $u \in U \cap \operatorname{null} T$. Then, we can write $u$ as a linear combination of the vectors $\{u_1, u_2, \ldots, u_k\}$. Since $u \in \operatorname{null} T$, we know that $T(u)=0$. But, since the vectors $\{u_1, u_2, \ldots, u_k\}$ are a basis for the null space of $T$, we know that $u$ must be the zero vector. Therefore, $U \cap \operatorname{null} T=\{0\}$.\n\nWe can also show that range $T=\{T u: u \in U\}$. Suppose that $w \in \operatorname{range} T$. Then, we can write $w$ as $T(v)$ for some $v \in V$. Since the vectors $\{v_{k+1}, \ldots, v_n\}$ are a basis for the complement of the null space of $T$, we know that $v$ can be written as a linear combination of these vectors. But, since the vectors $\{u_1, u_2, \ldots, u_k\}$ are a basis for the null space of $T$, we know that $v$ can also be written as a linear combination of these vectors. Therefore, we can write $w$ as $T(u)$ for some $u \in U$. This shows that range $T \subseteq \{T u: u \in U\}$.\n\nTo show the reverse inclusion, suppose that $w \in \{T u: u \in U\}$. Then, we can write $w$ as $T(u)$ for some $u \in U$. But, since $u$ can be written as a linear combination of the vectors $\{u_1, u_2, \ldots, u_k\}$, we know that $u \in \operatorname{null} T$. Therefore, $w \in \operatorname{range} T$. This shows that $\{T u: u \in U\} \subseteq \operatorname{range} T$.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that $U \cap \operatorname{null} T=\{0\}$ and range $T=\{T u: u \in U\}$.

",2,1,"16772,16356,325,322,166,200,167","# Informal Proof:\n\nTo prove that $T$ is a scalar multiple of the identity operator, we start by considering the given condition that every subspace of $V$ with dimension $\operatorname{dim} V-1$ is invariant under $T$. This means that for any such subspace $W$, we have $T(W) \subseteq W$.\n\nLet's consider the subspace $W$ spanned by the standard basis vectors of $V$, excluding one of them, say $\mathbf{v}_1$. This subspace $W$ has dimension $\operatorname{dim} V-1$. Since $W$ is invariant under $T$, we have $T(W) \subseteq W$.\n\nNow, let's consider the action of $T$ on the excluded basis vector $\mathbf{v}_1$. Since $T(W) \subseteq W$, we have $T(\mathbf{v}_1) \in W$. But $W$ is spanned by the remaining basis vectors, so we can write $T(\mathbf{v}_1) = c_2\mathbf{v}_2 + \cdots + c_n\mathbf{v}_n$ for some scalars $c_2, \ldots, c_n$.\n\nNow, let's consider the action of $T$ on the basis vector $\mathbf{v}_2$. Since $W$ is invariant under $T$, we have $T(\mathbf{v}_2) \in W$. But $W$ is spanned by the remaining basis vectors, so we can write $T(\mathbf{v}_2) = c_1\mathbf{v}_1 + c_3\mathbf{v}_3 + \cdots + c_n\mathbf{v}_n$ for some scalars $c_1, c_3, \ldots, c_n$.\n\nComparing the two expressions for $T(\mathbf{v}_1)$ and $T(\mathbf{v}_2)$, we see that $c_1 = 0$ and $c_2 = 0$. This is because the coefficients of $\mathbf{v}_1$ and $\mathbf{v}_2$ in the two expressions must be equal, but we have already shown that $T(\mathbf{v}_1) = c_2\mathbf{v}_2 + \cdots + c_n\mathbf{v}_n$ and $T(\mathbf{v}_2) = c_1\mathbf{v}_1 + c_3\mathbf{v}_3 + \cdots + c_n\mathbf{v}_n$.\n\nContinuing in this way, we can show that $T(\mathbf{v}_i) = 0$ for all $i$. This is because each basis vector $\mathbf{v}_i$ is in the span of the remaining basis vectors, and we have already shown that $T$ maps each of these basis vectors to zero.\n\nSince $T$ maps each basis vector to zero, we have $T(\mathbf{v}) = 0$ for all $\mathbf{v} \in V$. This means that $T$ is the zero operator, which is a scalar multiple of the identity operator.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that $T$ is a scalar multiple of the identity operator.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\n\nopen Fintype Complex Polynomial LinearMap FiniteDimensional Module Module.End\nopen scoped BigOperators\n\n/-- Suppose \( T \in \mathcal{L}(V) \) is such that every subspace of \( V \) with dimension \( \operatorname{dim} V-1 \) is invariant under \( T \).

",1,1,"2092,16660,16661,2091,2086","# Informal Proof:\n\nTo prove that every subspace of $V$ invariant under $T$ has even dimension, we first recall that a subspace $W$ of $V$ is said to be invariant under $T$ if $T(W) \subseteq W$. This means that for any vector $w \in W$, the image $T(w)$ is also in $W$.\n\nNow, let $W$ be a subspace of $V$ that is invariant under $T$. We want to show that the dimension of $W$ is even. To do this, we will use the fact that $T$ has no eigenvalues.\n\nRecall that an eigenvalue of $T$ is a scalar $\lambda$ such that there exists a non-zero vector $v \in V$ satisfying $T(v) = \lambda v$. Since $T$ has no eigenvalues, we know that for any non-zero vector $v \in V$, the equation $T(v) = \lambda v$ has no solution.\n\nNow, let $v \in W$ be a non-zero vector. Since $W$ is invariant under $T$, we know that $T(v) \in W$. We want to show that $T(v)$ is a multiple of $v$. To do this, we will use the fact that $T$ has no eigenvalues.\n\nSuppose, for the sake of contradiction, that $T(v)$ is not a multiple of $v$. Then, there exists a non-zero vector $w \in W$ such that $T(v)$ and $w$ are linearly independent. This means that the vectors $v$ and $w$ form a basis for a subspace of $W$.\n\nSince $T$ has no eigenvalues, we know that the equation $T(v) = \lambda v$ has no solution. This means that the vectors $v$ and $T(v)$ are linearly independent. Therefore, the vectors $v$ and $w$ are also linearly independent.\n\nNow, let $U$ be the subspace of $W$ spanned by the vectors $v$ and $w$. Since $v$ and $w$ are linearly independent, we know that the dimension of $U$ is at least 2.\n\nSince $U$ is a subspace of $W$, we know that $U$ is also invariant under $T$. Therefore, the dimension of $U$ is even.\n\nHowever, this contradicts the fact that the dimension of $U$ is at least 2. Therefore, our assumption that $T(v)$ is not a multiple of $v$ must be false. This means that $T(v)$ is a multiple of $v$.\n\nSince $v$ is an arbitrary non-zero vector in $W$, we know that every non-zero vector in $W$ is an eigenvector of $T$. This means that the only eigenvalue of $T$ is 0.\n\nSince the dimension of $W$ is equal to the number of linearly independent eigenvectors of $T$, we know that the dimension of $W$ is even.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that every subspace of $V$ invariant under $T$ has even dimension.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\n\nopen Fintype Complex Polynomial LinearMap FiniteDimensional Module Module.End\nopen scoped BigOperators\n\ntheorem exercise_5_24 {V : Type*} [AddCommGroup V]\n  [Module ℝ V] [FiniteDimensional ℝ V] {T : End ℝ V}\n  (hT : ∀ c : ℝ, eigenspace T c = ⊥) {U : Submodule ℝ V}\n  (hU : Submodule.map T U = U) : Even (finrank U) :=\nbegin\n  haveI : NoZeroSMulDivisors ℝ V := inferInstance,\n  haveI : FiniteDimensional ℝ U := FiniteDimensional.finiteDimensional_submodule U,\n  haveI : FiniteDimensional ℝ (U ⊔ Submodule.map T U) := FiniteDimensional.finiteDimensional_sup U (Submodule.map T U),\n  have h : U ⊔ Submodule.map T U = ⊤ := by simp [hU],\n  have h_dim : finrank ℝ U = finrank ℝ (U ⊔ Submodule.map T U) := by simp [h],\n  have h_even : Even (finrank ℝ (U ⊔ Submodule.map T U)) := by\n  { rw [finrank_eq_card_basis (Basis.ofVectorSpace ℝ (U ⊔ Submodule.map T U))],\n    exact Nat.even_iff.mpr (card_basis_ofVectorSpace_eq_finrank ℝ (U ⊔ Submodule.map T U)) },\n  rw [h_dim] at h_even,\n  exact h_even,\nend\n```",False

This implies that the matrix representation of $T$ has no real eigenvectors, and therefore, no real eigenvalues.\n\nNow, let's consider a subspace $W$ of $V$ that is invariant under $T$. This means that for any vector $w \in W$, the image $T(w)$ is also in $W$. We want to show that the dimension of $W$ is even.\n\nSuppose, for the sake of contradiction, that the dimension of $W$ is odd. Then, there exists a basis $\{w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_n\}$ of $W$ with $n$ being an odd integer.\n\nSince $W$ is invariant under $T$, the images $T(w_1), T(w_2), \ldots, T(w_n)$ are also in $W$. We can form a new basis $\{T(w_1), T(w_2), \ldots, T(w_n)\}$ of $W$.\n\nNow, consider the matrix representation of $T$ with respect to this new basis. Since $T$ has no real eigenvalues, the characteristic polynomial of this matrix has no real roots. However, this matrix has a real eigenvector, namely the vector $w_1$, which corresponds to the eigenvalue 1.\n\nThis is a contradiction, since we assumed that $T$ has no real eigenvalues. Therefore, our initial assumption that the dimension of $W$ is odd must be false, and we conclude that the dimension of $W$ is even.\n\nThis proof relies on the fact that the characteristic polynomial of a matrix with no real eigenvalues has no real roots, and that the existence of a real eigenvector for such a matrix leads to a contradiction.

A normal operator $A$ on a Hilbert space $\HH$ is one that commutes with its adjoint, i.e., $AA^* = A^*A$. We will also recall that a Hermitian operator is one that is equal to its own adjoint, i.e., $A = A^*$.\n\nWe will start by assuming that $A$ is a normal operator on a complex inner-product space $V$. Our goal is to show that there exists an operator $S$ on $V$ such that $S^2 = A$.\n\nSince $A$ is normal, we know that $AA^* = A^*A$. We can use this fact to show that $A$ has a square root. To do this, we will consider the operator $B = \frac{1}{2}(A + A^*)$.

Now, we can use the fact that the inverse of $a_n$ is $a_n^{-1}$, so we can rewrite the equation as $a_1 \circ (a_2 \circ \dots \circ (a_n \circ a_n^{-1})) = e$.\n\nContinuing this process, we can simplify the equation by canceling out the $a_n$ terms: $a_1 \circ (a_2 \circ \dots \circ e) = e$. Since $e$ is the identity element, we can simplify the equation further to $a_1 \circ (a_2 \circ \dots \circ a_{n-1}) = e$.\n\nNow, we can use the fact that the inverse of $a_{n-1}$ is $a_{n-1}^{-1}$, so we can rewrite the equation as $a_1 \circ (a_2 \circ \dots \circ a_{n-1} \circ a_{n-1}^{-1}) = e$. Continuing this process, we can simplify the equation by canceling out the $a_{n-1}$ terms: $a_1 \circ (a_2 \circ \dots \circ a_1^{-1}) = e$.\n\nFinally, we can use the fact that the inverse of $a_1$ is $a_1^{-1}$, so we can rewrite the equation as $a_1^{-1} \circ (a_2 \circ \dots \circ a_1^{-1}) = e$. This shows that $a_n^{-1}a_{n-1}^{-1}\dots a_1^{-1}$ is the inverse of $a_1a_2\dots a_n$.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that $(a_1a_2\dots a_n)^{-1} = a_n^{-1}a_{n-1}^{-1}\dots a_1^{-1}$ for all $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n\in G$.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\n\nopen Fintype Subgroup Set Polynomial Ideal\nopen scoped BigOperators\n\n/-- Prove that $(a_1a_2\dots a_n)^{-1} = a_n^{-1}a_{n-1}^{-1}\dots a_1^{-1}$ for all $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n\in G$.-/\ntheorem exercise_1_1_15 {G : Type*} [Group G] (as : List G) :\n  as.prod⁻¹ = (as.reverse.map (λ x => x⁻¹)).prod :=\nbegin\n  induction as with a as ih,\n  { simp },\n  { simp [ih, List.prod_cons, List.map_cons, List.prod_append] }\nend\n```",False

In other words, if we have two permutations $f$ and $g$ in $S_{\Omega}$, then their composite $g \circ f$ is also a permutation in $S_{\Omega}$.\n\n## Associativity\n\nTo show that the operation of function composition is associative in $S_{\Omega}$, we can use the fact that the set of all self-maps under composition forms a monoid. This is stated in Theorem Set of all Self-Maps under Composition forms Monoid. In other words, if we have three permutations $f$, $g$, and $h$ in $S_{\Omega}$, then we have $(h \circ g) \circ f = h \circ (g \circ f)$.\n\n## Existence of Identity\n\nTo show that $S_{\Omega}$ has an identity element, we can use the fact that the identity mapping is a bijection. This is stated in Theorem 671: Identity Mapping is Bijection. In other words, the identity mapping $I_{\Omega}$ is a permutation in $S_{\Omega}$, and for any permutation $f$ in $S_{\Omega}$, we have $I_{\Omega} \circ f = f \circ I_{\Omega} = f$.\n\n## Existence of Inverse\n\nTo show that every permutation in $S_{\Omega}$ has an inverse, we can use the fact that the inverse of a permutation is also a permutation. This is stated in Theorem Inverse of Permutation is Permutation. In other words, if we have a permutation $f$ in $S_{\Omega}$, then its inverse $f^{-1}$ is also a permutation in $S_{\Omega}$, and we have $f \circ f^{-1} = f^{-1} \circ f = I_{\Omega}$.\n\n## Infinity of $S_{\Omega}$\n\nTo show that $S_{\Omega}$ is infinite, we can use the fact that there are infinitely many permutations in $S_{\Omega}$. For example, we can consider the set of all permutations that fix the element $1$ and permute the remaining elements. This set is infinite, and each permutation in this set is a distinct element of $S_{\Omega}$.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that $S_{\Omega}$ satisfies all four group axioms, and it is an infinite group.","```lean\nimport Mathlib\n\nopen Fintype Subgroup Set Polynomial Ideal\nopen scoped BigOperators\n\n-- Prove that if Ω = {1, 2, 3, ...} then S_Ω is an infinite group\ntheorem exercise_1_3_8 : Infinite (Equiv.Perm ℕ) :=\n  -- Use the fact that the set of all permutations of ℕ is infinite\n  inferInstance\n```",False

In this case, $H$ is a subgroup of the additive group of rational numbers, so it must be closed under addition.\n\nNow, let's consider the property that $1/x \in H$ for every nonzero element $x$ of $H$. This means that for any rational number $x = p/q$, where $p, q \in \Z_{\ne 0}$, we have $1/x = q/p \in H$.\n\nWe can use this property to show that $H$ contains all rational numbers. Let $x = p/q$ be any nonzero rational number. Since $1/x \in H$, we have $q/p \in H$. But then, by the property of subgroups, we have $p/q + q/p \in H$. Simplifying this expression, we get $p^2/q^2 + q^2/p^2 \in H$.\n\nNow, let's consider the element $y = p^2/q^2 + q^2/p^2$. We can rewrite this as $y = (p^2 + q^2)/q^2$. Since $p, q \in \Z_{\ne 0}$, we have $p^2 + q^2 \in \Z_{\ne 0}$ and $q^2 \in \Z_{\ne 0}$. Therefore, $y \in \mathbb{Q}$.\n\nBut now, we can use the property of subgroups again to show that $y \in H$. We have $y = (p^2 + q^2)/q^2 = (p^2/q^2) + (q^2/p^2) \in H$. But this means that $p^2/q^2 \in H$, since $H$ is closed under addition.\n\nWe can repeat this process indefinitely, showing that $H$ contains all rational numbers of the form $p^2/q^2$, $p^4/q^4$, $p^6/q^6$, and so on. But this means that $H$ contains all rational numbers, since we can express any rational number as a finite sum of these elements.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that $H = \mathbb{Q}$, or $H = 0$.

",0,1,1792,"# Informal Proof:\n\nTo prove that if $H$ is a proper subgroup of the finite group $G$ then there is a maximal subgroup of $G$ containing $H$, we can follow a series of steps.\n\nFirst, let's consider the set $S$ defined as the set of elements in $G$ that can be expressed as a conjugate of an element in $H$. This set $S$ is a subset of $G$ and contains all the conjugates of $H$.\n\nWe know from the given theorem that there is at least one element of $G$ not contained in $H$ or in any of its conjugates. This means that $S$ is not equal to $G$, as there are elements in $G$ that are not in $S$.\n\nNow, let's consider the normalizer of $H$ in $G$, denoted as $\map {N_G} H$. The normalizer is the largest subgroup of $G$ that contains $H$ as a normal subgroup. We know that $H$ is a subgroup of the normalizer, and the index of the normalizer in $G$ is less than or equal to the index of $H$ in $G$.\n\nUsing this information, we can show that the number of elements in $S$ is less than or equal to the order of $H$ times the index of the normalizer in $G$. This is because each conjugate of $H$ has the same number of elements as $H$, and there are as many conjugates as the index of the normalizer in $G$.\n\nNow, let's consider two cases. If $H$ is normal in $G$, then the normalizer is equal to $G$, and the index of the normalizer in $G$ is less than the index of $H$ in $G$. In this case, the number of elements in $S$ is less than the order of $H$ times the index of $H$ in $G$, which is equal to the order of $G$.\n\nIf $H$ is not normal in $G$, then it has multiple conjugates, and the identity element of $G$ is common to all of them. This means that the conjugates of $H$ are not disjoint, and the number of elements in $S$ is less than the order of $H$ times the index of the normalizer in $G$.\n\nIn either case, we have shown that the number of elements in $S$ is less than the order of $G$. This means that there are elements in $G$ that are not in $S$, and therefore not in any of the conjugates of $H$.\n\nNow, let's consider the subgroups of $G$ that contain $H$. We know that $H$ is a subgroup of $G$, and any subgroup that contains $H$ must also contain all the conjugates of $H$. Therefore, any subgroup that contains $H$ must contain $S$.\n\nSince $S$ is not equal to $G$, there must be a subgroup of $G$ that contains $H$ but is not equal to $G$. This subgroup is a maximal subgroup of $G$ containing $H$, as it is the largest subgroup of $G$ that contains $H$.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that if $H$ is a proper subgroup of the finite group $G$ then there is a maximal subgroup of $G$ containing $H$.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\n\nopen Fintype Subgroup Set Polynomial Ideal\nopen scoped BigOperators\n\ntheorem exercise_2_4_16a {G : Type*} [Group G] {H : Subgroup G}\n  (hH : H ≠ ⊤) :\n  ∃ M : Subgroup G, M ≠ ⊤ ∧\n  ∀ K : Subgroup G, M ≤ K → K = M ∨ K = ⊤ ∧\n  H ≤ M :=\n  by\n  -- We will use the normalizer of H as our candidate for M\n  let N := H.normalizer\n  -- Since H is a proper subgroup, there exists an element g in G that is not in H\n  have h1 : ∃ g : G, g ∉ H := by\n    by_contra h\n    push_neg at h\n    exact hH (Subgroup.ext h)\n  -- Let g be such an element\n  obtain ⟨g, hg⟩ := h1\n  -- The normalizer N contains H and g\n  have h2 : H ≤ N := Subgroup.le_normalizer\n  have h3 : g ∈ N := Subgroup.mem_normalizer_iff.mpr (fun n => by simp [Subgroup.mem_carrier, hg])\n  -- We claim that N is the desired maximal subgroup\n  use N\n  constructor\n  -- N is not the whole group G\n  exact ne_of_lt (lt_of_le_of_lt h2 (lt_top_iff_ne_top.mpr hH))\n  -- For any subgroup K containing N, either K = N or K = G\n  intro K hK\n  have h4 : N ≤ K := hK\n  have h5 : K = N ∨ K = ⊤ := by\n    by_cases h6 : K = ⊤\n    · exact Or.inr h6\n    · left\n      exact le_antisymm h4 (Subgroup.normalizer_le.mpr h6)\n  -- Also, H is contained in N\n  exact ⟨h5, h2⟩\n```",False

Therefore, $k$ can be written as $k = p_1 p_2 \cdots p_m$ for some distinct prime numbers $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_m$. Since $H$ is a cyclic subgroup of $G$ of order $n/k$, we know that $H = \langle x^{n/k} \rangle$.\n\nSince $k = p_1 p_2 \cdots p_m$, we know that $n/k = n/(p_1 p_2 \cdots p_m)$. Therefore, $H = \langle x^{n/(p_1 p_2 \cdots p_m)} \rangle$. Since $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_m$ are distinct prime numbers, we know that $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_m$ are relatively prime. Therefore, we can write $n = p_1^a_1 p_2^a_2 \cdots p_m^a_m$ for some positive integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_m$.\n\nSince $H = \langle x^{n/(p_1 p_2 \cdots p_m)} \rangle$, we know that $x^{n/(p_1 p_2 \cdots p_m)} \in H$. Therefore, $x^{n/(p_1 p_2 \cdots p_m)} = x^{p_1^a_1 p_2^a_2 \cdots p_m^a_m / (p_1 p_2 \cdots p_m)}$. Since $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_m$ are distinct prime numbers, we know that $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_m$ are relatively prime. Therefore, we can write $p_1^a_1 p_2^a_2 \cdots p_m^a_m / (p_1 p_2 \cdots p_m) = p_1^{a_1 - 1} p_2^{a_2 - 1} \cdots p_m^{a_m - 1}$.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that $x^{n/(p_1 p_2 \cdots p_m)} = x^{p_1^{a_1 - 1} p_2^{a_2 - 1} \cdots p_m^{a_m - 1}}$. Since $H = \langle x^{n/(p_1 p_2 \cdots p_m)} \rangle$, we know that $H = \langle x^{p_1^{a_1 - 1} p_2^{a_2 - 1} \cdots p_m^{a_m - 1}} \rangle$.\n\nSince $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_m$ are distinct prime numbers, we know that $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_m$ are relatively prime. Therefore, we can write $p_1^{a_1 - 1} p_2^{a_2 - 1} \cdots p_m^{a_m - 1} = p_1^{b_1} p_2^{b_2} \cdots p_m^{b_m}$ for some non-negative integers $b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_m$.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that $H = \langle x^{p_1^{b_1} p_2^{b_2} \cdots p_m^{b_m}} \rangle$. Since $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_m$ are distinct prime numbers, we know that $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_m$ are relatively prime. Therefore, we can write $p_1^{b_1} p_2^{b_2} \cdots p_m^{b_m} = p^b$ for some prime number $p$ and some non-negative integer $b$.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that $H = \langle x^{p^b} \rangle$ for some prime number $p$ and some non-negative integer $b$. Since $p$ is a prime number, we know that $p$ divides $n$. Therefore, we have shown that $H = \langle x^p \rangle$ for some prime $p$ dividing $n$.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that a subgroup $H$ of a cyclic group $G = \langle x \rangle$ of order $n \geq 1$ is maximal if and only if $H = \langle x^p \rangle$ for some prime $p$ dividing $n$.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\n\nopen Fintype Subgroup Set Polynomial Ideal\nopen scoped BigOperators\n\ntheorem exercise_2_4_16c {n : ℕ} (H : AddSubgroup (ZMod n)) :\n  ∃ p : (ZMod n), Prime p ∧ H = AddSubgroup.closure {p} ↔\n  (H ≠ ⊤ ∧ ∀ K : AddSubgroup (ZMod n), H ≤ K → K = H ∨ K = ⊤) :=\nbegin\n  split,\n  { rintro ⟨p, hp, hH⟩,\n    refine ⟨λ h, _, λ K hK, _⟩,\n    { exfalso, apply h, rw hH, exact AddSubgroup.closure_singleton_eq_top_iff.mpr hp },\n    { by_cases hK' : K = ⊤,\n      { right, exact hK' },\n      { left, have : p ∈ K,\n        { rw hH, exact AddSubgroup.mem_closure_singleton.mpr (dvd_refl p) },\n        have : K = H,\n        { apply AddSubgroup.eq_of_le_of_prime_of_mem_zmod hp,\n          { exact hK },\n          { exact this } },\n        exact this } } },\n  { rintro ⟨hH, hK⟩,\n    obtain ⟨p, hp, hH'⟩ := AddSubgroup.exists_prime_of_ne_top_of_forall_le hH hK,\n    use [p, hp, hH'] }\nend\n```",False

This theorem provides a relationship between the orders of subgroups and their intersection.\n\nNow, let's assume that $H$ and $K$ are finite subgroups of $G$ whose orders are relatively prime, i.e., $\gcd(\order H, \order K) = 1$.

Since $K$ is not a subgroup of $H$, we know that $K \cap H$ is a proper subgroup of $H$. Therefore, the index of $K$ in $K \cap H$ is greater than 1.\n\nNow, let's consider the index of $K$ in $HK$. Since $HK$ is a subgroup of $G$, we know that $|HK| = |H| \cdot |K| / |H \cap K|$. Since $|H| = p$, we know that $|HK| = p \cdot |K| / |H \cap K|$.\n\nSince $K$ is not a subgroup of $H$, we know that $|H \cap K| < p$. Therefore, $|HK| > p$. But $|HK|$ is also a divisor of $|G| = n$, since $HK$ is a subgroup of $G$. Therefore, $|HK|$ must be equal to $n$, since $n$ is the smallest prime divisor of $n$.\n\nNow, we know that $|HK| = n$, and $|H| = p$. Therefore, $|K| = n/p$, since $|HK| = |H| \cdot |K| / |H \cap K|$. But $|K|$ is an integer, since $K$ is a subgroup of $G$. Therefore, $n/p$ must be an integer.\n\nSince $p$ is a prime number, we know that $n/p$ must be a multiple of $p$. Therefore, $n/p = p \cdot q$, for some integer $q$. But $n/p = n/p$, since $n/p$ is an integer. Therefore, $p \cdot q = n/p$, which implies that $q = n/(p^2)$.\n\nNow, we know that $|K| = n/p$, and $|K \cap H| = p \cdot q = n/p^2$. Therefore, the index of $K$ in $K \cap H$ is $p^2/n$, which is equal to $p$, since $n$ is a multiple of $p^2$.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that if $H$ is a normal subgroup of $G$ of prime index $p$, then for any subgroup $K$ of $G$, either $K$ is a subgroup of $H$, or $G = HK$ and $|K: K \cap H| = p$.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\n\nopen Fintype Subgroup Set Polynomial Ideal\nopen scoped BigOperators\n\n/-- Prove that if $H$ is a normal subgroup of $G$ of prime index $p$ then for all $K \leq G$ either $K \leq H$, or $G=H K$ and $|K: K \cap H|=p$.-/\n\ntheorem exercise_3_3_3 {p : Nat.Primes} {G : Type*} [Group G]\n  {H : Subgroup G} [hH : H.Normal] (hH1 : H.index = p) :\n  ∀ K : Subgroup G, K ≤ H ∨ H ⊔ K = ⊤ ∨ (K ⊓ H).relindex K = p :=\n  fun K =>\n  if hK : K ≤ H then Or.inl hK\n  else\n    have hK' : H ⊔ K = ⊤ := by\n      apply eq_top_of_card_eq\n      rw [card_sup_eq_mul_card_inf, card_top, hH1, Nat.mul_div_cancel_left]\n      exact Nat.pos_of_ne_zero (Nat.Prime.ne_zero p.2)\n    Or.inr (Or.inl hK')\n```",False

By the definition of Sylow subgroups, $P$ has order $p$ and $Q$ has order $q$. \n\nSince $G$ is abelian, we know that the intersection of $P$ and $Q$ must be the identity element $e$, as any non-identity element in the intersection would imply that $P$ and $Q$ have a common element of order greater than 1, contradicting the fact that $P$ and $Q$ are Sylow subgroups.\n\nNow, let's consider the union of $P$ and $Q$, denoted as $P \cup Q$. The number of elements in $P \cup Q$ is equal to the sum of the number of elements in $P$ and the number of elements in $Q$, minus the number of elements in the intersection of $P$ and $Q$. Since the intersection of $P$ and $Q$ is the identity element $e$, the number of elements in $P \cup Q$ is $q + p - 1$.\n\nHowever, we know that the order of $G$ is $p q$, which is greater than $q + p - 1$. This implies that there must be at least one non-identity element in $G$ that is not in $P$ or $Q$.\n\nLet's call this non-identity element $x$. Since $x$ is not in $P$ or $Q$, it must be the case that $x$ commutes with every element in $P$ and $Q$. \n\nNow, since $P$ and $Q$ are Sylow subgroups, they are normal subgroups of $G$. Therefore, $x$ commutes with every element in $P$ and $Q$, which implies that $x$ commutes with every element in $G$.\n\nSince $G$ is abelian, we know that every element in $G$ commutes with every other element. Therefore, $x$ must be the identity element $e$.\n\nHowever, this is a contradiction, as we assumed that $x$ is a non-identity element. Therefore, our assumption that $x$ is a non-identity element must be false.\n\nThis implies that there are no non-identity elements in $G$ that are not in $P$ or $Q$. Therefore, every non-identity element in $G$ must be in $P$ or $Q$.\n\nSince $P$ and $Q$ are Sylow subgroups, they are cyclic.

We also know that $T = \{e, t\}$ is a subgroup of $K$.\n\nUsing the theorem that every subgroup of an abelian group is normal, we can conclude that $T$ is a normal subgroup of $K$, since $K$ is abelian. This is because $K$ is a subgroup of $A_4$, and $A_4$ is not abelian, but $K$ itself is abelian.\n\nHowever, we also know that $T$ is not a normal subgroup of $A_4$, since $A_4$ is not abelian. This is a crucial point, as it shows that $T$ is a normal subgroup of $K$, but not a normal subgroup of $A_4$.\n\nNow, let's consider the characteristic subgroup property. We need to find an automorphism of $A_4$ that maps $T$ to a subgroup other than $T$. One such automorphism is the permutation $\phi$ that maps $e$ to $e$, $t$ to $u$, $u$ to $v$, and $v$ to $t$. This automorphism is well-defined, since it preserves the group operation.\n\nUnder this automorphism, $\phi(T) = \{e, u\}$, which is not equal to $T$. Therefore, $T$ is not a characteristic subgroup of $A_4$.\n\nIn conclusion, we have found a normal subgroup $T$ of $A_4$ that is not characteristic. This counterexample shows that there exists a normal subgroup that does not satisfy the property of being characteristic.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\n\nopen Fintype Subgroup Set Polynomial Ideal\nopen scoped BigOperators\n\n/-- Prove that there exists a normal subgroup that is not characteristic.-/\n\ntheorem exercise_4_4_6b :\n  ∃ (G : Type*) (hG : Group G) (H : @Subgroup G hG), @Characteristic G hG H  ∧ ¬ @Normal G hG H :=\n  -- We use the alternating group A4 on 4 letters as our group G.\n  let G := Equiv.Perm (Fin 4)\n  -- We define H as the subgroup generated by the 3-cycles in A4.\n  let H := closure {⟨swap 0 1 * swap 0 2, by simp⟩, ⟨swap 0 1 * swap 1 2, by simp⟩, ⟨swap 0 2 * swap 1 2, by simp⟩}\n  -- We show that H is a normal subgroup of G.\n  have h1 : @Normal G (inferInstance : Group G) H := inferInstance\n  -- We show that H is not a characteristic subgroup of G.\n  have h2 : ¬ @Characteristic G (inferInstance : Group G) H := by\n    -- We define an automorphism φ of G that maps the 3-cycles in H to a different subgroup.\n    let φ := Equiv.Perm.ofSubtype (fun x => x.1.1 = 0)\n    -- We show that φ(H) is not equal to H.\n    have h3 : φ '' H ≠ H := by\n      -- We use a proof by contradiction.\n      intro h4\n      -- We derive a contradiction by showing that the image of H under φ is not H.\n      have h5 : (⟨swap 0 1 * swap 0 2, by simp⟩ : G) ∈ H := by simp\n      have h6 : φ (⟨swap 0 1 * swap 0 2, by simp⟩ : G) ∉ H := by simp\n      exact h6 (h4 ▸ mem_image_of_mem φ h5)\n    exact h3\n  -- We conclude that there exists a normal subgroup that is not characteristic.\n  exact ⟨G, inferInstance, H, h1, h2⟩\n```",False

In other words, if $H$ is a normal subgroup of $G$, then for any $g \in G$, the conjugate $gHg^{-1}$ is equal to $H$.\n\nOn the other hand, a characteristic subgroup is a subgroup that is invariant under all automorphisms of the group. In other words, if $H$ is a characteristic subgroup of $G$, then for any automorphism $\phi$ of $G$, the image $\phi(H)$ is equal to $H$.\n\nNow, let's consider the alternating group $A_4$ on 4 letters.

We also know that $K$ is not a characteristic subgroup of $A_4$.\n\nTo see this, let's consider the inner automorphism $\kappa_x$ of $x \in A_4$. We know that $\kappa_x$ maps $K$ to itself if and only if $K$ is a normal subgroup of $A_4$. However, we also know that there exists an element $x \in A_4$ such that $\kappa_x$ does not map $K$ to itself. This is because $K$ is not a characteristic subgroup of $A_4$.\n\nNow, let's consider the subgroup $T = \{e, t\}$ of $K$. We know that $T$ is a normal subgroup of $K$ because $K$ is abelian. However, we also know that $T$ is not a normal subgroup of $A_4$ because $A_4$ is not abelian.\n\nThis provides us with a counterexample to the statement that every normal subgroup is characteristic.

",0,1,1813,"# Informal Proof:\n\nTo prove that a group of order 351 has a normal Sylow $p$-subgroup for some prime $p$ dividing its order, we can start by analyzing the prime factorization of 351. We know that $351 = 3^3 \cdot 13$. This tells us that the group $G$ has a prime factorization of $3^3 \cdot 13$.\n\nNow, let's consider the Sylow $3$-subgroup of $G$. By definition, the order of the Sylow $3$-subgroup must be a power of 3, and in this case, it must be $3^3$. We can use the given theorem, ""Prime Power Group has Non-Trivial Proper Normal Subgroup"", to show that the Sylow $3$-subgroup has a non-trivial proper normal subgroup.\n\nLet $H$ be the Sylow $3$-subgroup of $G$. Then $\order H = 3^3$. By the theorem, we know that $H$ has a non-trivial proper normal subgroup. Let $N$ be this normal subgroup. Then $N$ is a non-trivial proper normal subgroup of $H$.\n\nNow, let's consider the Sylow $13$-subgroup of $G$. By definition, the order of the Sylow $13$-subgroup must be a power of 13, and in this case, it must be $13^1$. We can use the same theorem to show that the Sylow $13$-subgroup has a non-trivial proper normal subgroup.\n\nLet $K$ be the Sylow $13$-subgroup of $G$. Then $\order K = 13$. By the theorem, we know that $K$ has a non-trivial proper normal subgroup. Let $M$ be this normal subgroup. Then $M$ is a non-trivial proper normal subgroup of $K$.\n\nNow, we can use the fact that $N$ is a non-trivial proper normal subgroup of $H$ and $M$ is a non-trivial proper normal subgroup of $K$. We can show that $NM$ is a normal subgroup of $G$.\n\nTo see this, let $g \in G$ and $n \in N$. Then $gng^{-1} \in N$ since $N$ is normal in $H$. Similarly, let $k \in K$ and $m \in M$. Then $gmg^{-1} \in M$ since $M$ is normal in $K$. Now, let $nm \in NM$. Then $g(nm)g^{-1} = (gng^{-1})(gmg^{-1}) \in NM$ since $gng^{-1} \in N$ and $gmg^{-1} \in M$. Therefore, $NM$ is normal in $G$.\n\nNow, we can use the fact that $NM$ is a normal subgroup of $G$ to show that $NM$ is a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$ for some prime $p$ dividing its order. We can do this by showing that $NM$ has order $p^n$ for some prime $p$ and integer $n$.\n\nTo see this, let $p$ be a prime dividing the order of $NM$. Then $p$ must divide the order of $N$ or the order of $M$. If $p$ divides the order of $N$, then $p = 3$ and $\order N = 3^k$ for some integer $k$. If $p$ divides the order of $M$, then $p = 13$ and $\order M = 13^l$ for some integer $l$. In either case, we can show that $\order NM = p^m$ for some integer $m$.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that $G$ has a normal Sylow $p$-subgroup for some prime $p$ dividing its order.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\n\nopen Fintype Subgroup Set Polynomial Ideal\nopen scoped BigOperators\n\n/-- Prove that a group of order 351 has a normal Sylow $p$-subgroup for some prime $p$ dividing its order.-/\ntheorem exercise_4_5_15 {G : Type*} [Group G] [Fintype G]\n  (hG : card G = 351) :\n  ∃ (p : ℕ) (P : Sylow p G), P.Normal :=\nbegin\n  -- We start by factoring the order of the group G, which is 351.\n  have h351 : 351 = 3^3 * 13 := by norm_num,\n  -- We know that the order of G is 351, so we can use this fact to find a prime p and a Sylow p-subgroup.\n  -- We will use the Sylow theorems to find a normal Sylow p-subgroup.\n  -- By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, divides 13 and is congruent to 1 modulo 3.\n  -- The only number that satisfies these conditions is 1.\n  -- Therefore, there is exactly one Sylow 3-subgroup, which must be normal.\n  let P3 := Sylow.Syl3 G,\n  have hP3 : P3.Normal := Sylow.normal_of_coprime (by norm_num : 3 ∣ 351) (by norm_num : 3 ≠ 1),\n  -- Similarly, the number of Sylow 13-subgroups, n_13, divides 3^3 and is congruent to 1 modulo 13.\n  -- The only number that satisfies these conditions is 1.\n  -- Therefore, there is exactly one Sylow 13-subgroup, which must be normal.\n  let P13 := Sylow.Syl13 G,\n  have hP13 : P13.Normal := Sylow.normal_of_coprime (by norm_num : 13 ∣ 351) (by norm_num : 13 ≠ 1),\n  -- We have found a normal Sylow 3-subgroup and a normal Sylow 13-subgroup.\n  -- Therefore, we can conclude that there exists a normal Sylow p-subgroup for some prime p dividing the order of G.\n  use 3,\n  use P3,\n  exact hP3,\nend\n```",False

By the First Sylow Theorem, $G$ has at least one Sylow $3$-subgroup, Sylow $5$-subgroup, and Sylow $7$-subgroup.\n\nLet $n_5$ denote the number of Sylow $5$-subgroups of $G$ and $n_7$ denote the number of Sylow $7$-subgroups of $G$. Since $5$ and $7$ appear in $105$ with multiplicity $1$, any Sylow $p$-subgroups are prime groups.\n\nWe need to show that either $n_5 = 1$ or $n_7 = 1$. By the Fourth Sylow Theorem, $n_5 \equiv 1 \pmod 5$ and $n_5 \divides 105$. This implies that $n_5 \in \set {1, 21}$. Similarly, by the Fourth Sylow Theorem, $n_7 \equiv 1 \pmod 7$ and $n_7 \divides 105$, which implies that $n_7 \in \set {1, 15}$.\n\nIf either $n_5 = 1$ or $n_7 = 1$, then the unique Sylow $5$-subgroup or the unique Sylow $7$-subgroup is normal, respectively. So, we can assume that $n_7 = 15$ and $n_5 = 21$.\n\nSuppose $n_7 = 15$. Since all of these Sylow $7$-subgroups are prime, the intersection of any two of them is $\set e$. Thus, these $15$ Sylow $7$-subgroups contribute $6 \times 15 = 90$ distinct elements to $G$. This leaves $15$ elements still to be accounted for.\n\nSuppose $n_5 = 21$. By a similar argument, these $21$ Sylow $5$-subgroups contribute $4 \times 21 = 84$ distinct elements to $G$. None of these elements, apart from $e$, can also be elements of one of the Sylow $7$-subgroups. But there are only $15$ elements available. So, it is not possible for both $n_7 = 15$ and $n_5 = 21$.\n\nTherefore, either $n_7 = 1$ or $n_5 = 1$. If $n_7 = 1$, then the unique Sylow $7$-subgroup is normal.

This is because the intersection of any two Sylow $3$-subgroups is a subgroup of order $3$, and the intersection of all Sylow $3$-subgroups is a subgroup of order $3$.\n\nNow, let's consider the Sylow $103$-subgroups. By the Sylow Theorems, the number of Sylow $103$-subgroups must be of the form $1 + 103k$, where $k$ is a non-negative integer. Since $G$ has a Sylow $103$-subgroup of order $103$, the number of Sylow $103$-subgroups must be greater than $1$.\n\nHowever, if the number of Sylow $103$-subgroups is greater than $1$, then the intersection of all Sylow $103$-subgroups must be a subgroup of order $103$. This is because the intersection of any two Sylow $103$-subgroups is a subgroup of order $103$, and the intersection of all Sylow $103$-subgroups is a subgroup of order $103$.\n\nNow, let's consider the intersection of all Sylow $3$-subgroups and all Sylow $103$-subgroups. Since the intersection of all Sylow $3$-subgroups is a subgroup of order $3$ and the intersection of all Sylow $103$-subgroups is a subgroup of order $103$, the intersection of all Sylow $3$-subgroups and all Sylow $103$-subgroups must be a subgroup of order $3 \times 103 = 309$.\n\nHowever, this is a contradiction because the order of the intersection of all Sylow $3$-subgroups and all Sylow $103$-subgroups must divide the order of $G$, which is $2907$. Since $309$ does not divide $2907$, this is a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, the number of Sylow $3$-subgroups or the number of Sylow $103$-subgroups must be $1$. If the number of Sylow $3$-subgroups is $1$, then the Sylow $3$-subgroup is normal in $G$. If the number of Sylow $103$-subgroups is $1$, then the Sylow $103$-subgroup is normal in $G$.\n\nIn either case, $G$ has a normal subgroup of order $3$ or $103$, which means that $G$ is not simple.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\n\nopen Fintype Subgroup Set Polynomial Ideal\nopen scoped BigOperators\n\n/-- Prove that if $|G|=2907$ then $G$ is not simple.-/\ntheorem exercise_4_5_21 {G : Type*} [Fintype G] [Group G]\n  (hG : card G = 2907) : ¬ IsSimpleGroup G := by\n  -- Since 2907 = 3 * 3 * 103, we can use the Sylow theorems to find the number of Sylow 3-subgroups and Sylow 103-subgroups in G.\n  let p := 3\n  let q := 103\n  have h_prime_p : Nat.Prime p := by norm_num\n  have h_prime_q : Nat.Prime q := by norm_num\n  -- By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups (n_p) must be of the form 1 + 3k, where k is a non-negative integer.\n  have h_sylow_p : ∃ n_p : ℕ, n_p ≡ 1 [MOD p] ∧ n_p ∣ 2907 := by\n    apply exists_eq_mul_left_of_dvd\n    apply Nat.modEq_one_of_dvd\n    norm_num\n  -- Similarly, the number of Sylow 103-subgroups (n_q) must be of the form 1 + 103k, where k is a non-negative integer.\n  have h_sylow_q : ∃ n_q : ℕ, n_q ≡ 1 [MOD q] ∧ n_q ∣ 2907 := by\n    apply exists_eq_mul_left_of_dvd\n    apply Nat.modEq_one_of_dvd\n    norm_num\n  -- If the number of Sylow 3-subgroups or Sylow 103-subgroups is greater than 1, then the intersection of all Sylow 3-subgroups or Sylow 103-subgroups must be a normal subgroup.\n  cases' h_sylow_p with n_p h_n_p\n  cases' h_sylow_q with n_q h_n_q\n  -- Since the order of the intersection of all Sylow 3-subgroups and all Sylow 103-subgroups must divide the order of G, which is 2907, and since 309 does not divide 2907, this is a contradiction.\n  have h_contradiction : n_p = 1 ∨ n_q = 1 := by\n    -- Proof by contradiction\n    by_contra h\n    push_neg at h\n    have h_n_p_gt_1 : n_p > 1 := by linarith\n    have h_n_q_gt_1 : n_q > 1 := by linarith\n    -- If n_p > 1, then the intersection of all Sylow 3-subgroups is a normal subgroup of order 3.\n    -- If n_q > 1, then the intersection of all Sylow 103-subgroups is a normal subgroup of order 103.\n    -- In either case, G has a normal subgroup, which means that G is not simple.\n    exfalso\n    -- Since 309 does not divide 2907, we have a contradiction.\n    have h_order_intersection : 3 * 103 ∣ 2907 := by norm_num\n    have h_order_intersection_not_div : ¬ (3 * 103 ∣ 2907) := by norm_num\n    contradiction\n  -- Therefore, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups or Sylow 103-subgroups must be 1.\n  cases' h_contradiction with h_n_p_eq_1 h_n_q_eq_1\n  -- If the number of Sylow 3-subgroups is 1, then the Sylow 3-subgroup is normal in G.\n  -- If the number of Sylow 103-subgroups is 1, then the Sylow 103-subgroup is normal in G.\n  -- In either case, G has a normal subgroup, which means that G is not simple.\n  exact not_isSimpleGroup_of_normal_subgroup (by assumption)\n  exact not_isSimpleGroup_of_normal_subgroup (by assumption)\n```",False

We can write $2907 = 3 \cdot 971$.\n\nUsing the Sylow Theorems, we can determine the number of Sylow $3$-subgroups and Sylow $971$-subgroups in $G$.\n\nLet $n_3$ denote the number of Sylow $3$-subgroups of $G$. From the Fourth Sylow Theorem, we know that $n_3 \equiv 1 \pmod 3$, and from the Fifth Sylow Theorem, we know that $n_3 \divides 97$. It follows that $n_3 \in \set {1, 97}$.\n\nLet $n_{971}$ denote the number of Sylow $971$-subgroups of $G$. From the Fourth Sylow Theorem, we know that $n_{971} \equiv 1 \pmod {971}$, and from the Fifth Sylow Theorem, we know that $n_{971} \divides 3$. It follows that $n_{971} \in \set {1, 3}$.\n\nNow, let's consider the two possible cases:\n\nCase 1: Suppose $n_3 = 1$. In this case, the unique Sylow $3$-subgroup of $G$ is normal. Let's denote this subgroup as $P$. Then, the quotient group $G / P$ has order $971$. Since $971$ is a prime number, $G / P$ is a cyclic group of order $971$. By the Correspondence Theorem, $P$ is a normal subgroup of $G$ with order $3$. Therefore, $G$ has a proper non-trivial normal subgroup.\n\nCase 2: Suppose $n_3 = 97$. In this case, the Sylow $3$-subgroups of $G$ are not normal. Let's denote the Sylow $3$-subgroups of $G$ as $P_1, P_2, \ldots, P_{97}$. Each intersection $P_i \cap P_j$ for $i, j \in \set {1, 2, \ldots, 97}, i \ne j$ is the trivial subgroup of $G$. Thus, $G$ contains $97$ elements of order $3$, which is not possible since $G$ has order $2907$. Therefore, this case is not possible.\n\nIn both cases, we have shown that $G$ has a proper non-trivial normal subgroup. Therefore, $G$ is not simple.\n\nNote that this proof is similar to the proof in the context, where we showed that a group of order $30$ is not simple.

We have that $|G|=462$. We can factorize 462 as $462 = 2 \times 3 \times 7 \times 11$. This tells us that the prime factorization of $|G|$ is composed of four distinct prime numbers.\n\nNow, let's consider the Sylow 2-subgroups of $G$. Let $n_2$ denote the number of Sylow 2-subgroups of $G$. By the Sylow theorems, $n_2$ must be of the form $1+2k$, where $k$ is a non-negative integer.\n\nWe can use the fact that the order of $G$ divides the factorial of the index of any subgroup. In this case, the index of any Sylow 2-subgroup is 2, 3, 6, 11, 22, 33, 66, or 132. We can calculate the factorial of each of these indices and check if $|G|$ divides any of them.\n\nHowever, we can also use a more direct approach. Since $n_2$ must be of the form $1+2k$, we can consider the possible values of $n_2$. If $n_2=1$, then the Sylow 2-subgroup is unique and hence normal in $G$. This would imply that $G$ has a normal subgroup of order 4, which would make $G$ not simple.\n\nOn the other hand, if $n_2>1$, then we can use the fact that the number of Sylow 2-subgroups is equal to the index of the normalizer of a Sylow 2-subgroup. Let $P$ be a Sylow 2-subgroup of $G$. Then the normalizer of $P$ has index $n_2$ in $G$. We can use this fact to derive a contradiction.\n\nAssume that $n_2>1$. Then the normalizer of $P$ has index $n_2$ in $G$. By the order of simple group divides factorial of index of subgroup theorem, we have that $|G|$ divides $n_2!$. However, since $n_2>1$, we have that $n_2!$ is a multiple of $n_2 \geq 3$. This implies that $|G|$ is a multiple of $3!$, which is equal to 6.\n\nHowever, we know that $|G|=462$, which is not a multiple of 6. This is a contradiction, and hence our assumption that $n_2>1$ must be false.\n\nTherefore, we conclude that $n_2=1$, and hence the Sylow 2-subgroup is unique and normal in $G$.

We want to show that $I$ is principal, i.e., there exists an element $x \in R$ such that $I = \ideal x$.\n\nWe'll use the two given conditions to our advantage. Condition (i) tells us that any two nonzero elements $a$ and $b$ in $R$ have a greatest common divisor (GCD) that can be written in the form $r a + s b$ for some $r, s \in R$. This means that we can always find a GCD for any two elements in $R$.\n\nNow, let's consider the set $S$ of all elements in $I$ that are GCDs of pairs of elements in $I$. We can show that $S$ is non-empty by considering the GCD of any two elements in $I$. By condition (i), this GCD exists and is in $I$, so $S$ is non-empty.\n\nWe'll show that $S$ has a least element, which we'll call $x$. To do this, we'll use condition (ii). Suppose we have a sequence of elements $a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots$ in $I$ such that $a_{i+1} \mid a_i$ for all $i$. By condition (ii), there exists a positive integer $N$ such that $a_n$ is a unit times $a_N$ for all $n \geq N$. This means that the sequence $a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots$ is eventually constant, and the constant element is a unit times $a_N$.\n\nNow, let's consider the GCD of $a_1$ and $a_2$. By condition (i), this GCD exists and is in $I$. Since $a_2 \mid a_1$, the GCD of $a_1$ and $a_2$ is a unit times $a_1$. Similarly, the GCD of $a_2$ and $a_3$ is a unit times $a_2$, and so on. This means that the GCD of $a_1$ and $a_2$ is a unit times the GCD of $a_2$ and $a_3$, and so on.\n\nSince the sequence $a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots$ is eventually constant, the GCD of $a_1$ and $a_2$ is a unit times the constant element $a_N$. This means that the GCD of $a_1$ and $a_2$ is a unit times a unit times $a_N$, and so on. This shows that the GCD of $a_1$ and $a_2$ is a unit times a unit times $\ldots$ times a unit times $a_N$, where the number of units is finite.\n\nNow, let's consider the GCD of $a_1$ and $a_2$ again. By condition (i), this GCD exists and is in $I$. Since the GCD of $a_1$ and $a_2$ is a unit times a unit times $\ldots$ times a unit times $a_N$, we can write the GCD of $a_1$ and $a_2$ as $r a_1 + s a_2$ for some $r, s \in R$. This means that the GCD of $a_1$ and $a_2$ is in the ideal generated by $a_1$ and $a_2$.\n\nSince the GCD of $a_1$ and $a_2$ is in the ideal generated by $a_1$ and $a_2$, and the ideal generated by $a_1$ and $a_2$ is a subset of $I$, we have that the GCD of $a_1$ and $a_2$ is in $I$. This shows that $S$ is non-empty and has a least element, which we'll call $x$.\n\nNow, let's show that $I = \ideal x$. To do this, we'll show that every element in $I$ is a multiple of $x$. Let $y \in I$. Since $x$ is the least element in $S$, we have that $x \mid y$. This means that there exists an element $z \in R$ such that $y = x z$. This shows that every element in $I$ is a multiple of $x$, and therefore $I = \ideal x$.\n\nThis shows that every ideal in $R$ is principal, and therefore $R$ is a Principal Ideal Domain.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\n\nopen Fintype Subgroup Set Polynomial Ideal\nopen scoped BigOperators\n\ntheorem exercise_8_2_4 {R : Type*} [Ring R][NoZeroDivisors R]\n  [CancelCommMonoidWithZero R] [GCDMonoid R]\n  (h1 : ∀ a b : R, a ≠ 0 → b ≠ 0 → ∃ r s : R, gcd a b = r*a + s*b)\n  (h2 : ∀ a : ℕ → R, (∀ i j : ℕ, i < j → a i ∣ a j) →\n  ∃ N : ℕ, ∀ n ≥ N, ∃ u : R, IsUnit u ∧ a n = u * a N) :\n  IsPrincipalIdealRing R :=\nbegin\n  -- We need to show that every ideal in R is principal.\n  -- Let I be an arbitrary ideal in R.\n  intro I,\n  -- We need to show that I is principal, i.e., there exists an element x in R such that I = ideal x.\n  -- Consider the set S of all elements in I that are GCDs of pairs of elements in I.\n  let S := {x : R | ∃ a b : R, a ∈ I ∧ b ∈ I ∧ x = gcd a b},\n  -- S is non-empty because any two elements in I have a GCD in I.\n  have hS : S.nonempty,\n  { obtain ⟨a, b, ha, hb, hab⟩ := h1 1 1 (by norm_num) (by norm_num),\n    exact ⟨gcd 1 1, 1, 1, ha, hb, hab⟩ },\n  -- Let x be the least element in S.\n  obtain ⟨x, hx⟩ := hS,\n  -- We need to show that I = ideal x.\n  -- To do this, we will show that every element in I is a multiple of x.\n  have h : ∀ y ∈ I, ∃ z : R, y = x * z,\n  { intro y hy,\n    -- Since x is the least element in S, we have that x divides y.\n    obtain ⟨a, b, ha, hb, hxy⟩ := hx,\n    obtain ⟨r, s, hgcd⟩ := h1 a b ha hb,\n    -- This means that there exists an element z in R such that y = x * z.\n    use r * y + s * b,\n    rw [hxy, hgcd, mul_add, add_comm, mul_assoc, mul_assoc, ←mul_add],\n    exact hy },\n  -- Therefore, I = ideal x.\n  exact ⟨x, h⟩,\nend\n```",False

Then, we have:\n\n$(ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i \equiv 0 \pmod{q}$\n\nThis implies that both $ac - bd$ and $ad + bc$ are multiples of $q$.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where $q \equiv 3 \pmod{4}$. We need to show that this implies that $\mathbb{Z}[i] /(q)$ is a field with $q^{2}$ elements.\n\nSince $q \equiv 3 \pmod{4}$, we know that $q$ is not a multiple of $4$. This implies that the ideal generated by $q$ in $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ is not a maximal ideal.\n\nTo see this, let's consider the element $1 + i$ in $\mathbb{Z}[i]$. We claim that $1 + i$ is not a multiple of $q$. To see this, let's assume that $1 + i = (a + bi) q$ for some $a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$. Then, we have:\n\n$1 + i = (a + bi) q$\n$1 + i = (a + bi) (q)$\n\nThis implies that $a + bi$ is a multiple of $q$. However, this is a contradiction, since $a + bi$ is not a multiple of $q$.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that $1 + i$ is not a multiple of $q$. This implies that the ideal generated by $q$ in $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ is not a maximal ideal.\n\nNow, let's consider the quotient ring $\mathbb{Z}[i] /(q)$. Since the ideal generated by $q$ in $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ is not a maximal ideal, we know that $\mathbb{Z}[i] /(q)$ is a field.\n\nTo see this, let's consider the element $1 + i$ in $\mathbb{Z}[i] /(q)$. We claim that $1 + i$ is a unit in $\mathbb{Z}[i] /(q)$. To see this, let's consider the element $1 - i$ in $\mathbb{Z}[i] /(q)$. We claim that $(1 + i) (1 - i) \equiv 1 \pmod{q}$.\n\nTo see this, let's compute the product $(1 + i) (1 - i)$:\n\n$(1 + i) (1 - i) = 1 - i + i - i^{2}$\n$= 1 - i + i + 1$\n$= 2$\n\nSince $2$ is not a multiple of $q$, we have:\n\n$(1 + i) (1 - i) \equiv 2 \pmod{q}$\n\nHowever, this is a contradiction, since we assumed that $(1 + i) (1 - i) \equiv 1 \pmod{q}$.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that $1 + i$ is a unit in $\mathbb{Z}[i] /(q)$. This implies that $\mathbb{Z}[i] /(q)$ is a field.\n\nTo see that $\mathbb{Z}[i] /(q)$ has $q^{2}$ elements, let's consider the elements of the form $a + bi$ in $\mathbb{Z}[i] /(q)$. Since $a$ and $b$ can take on any value modulo $q$, we have $q$ choices for $a$ and $q$ choices for $b$. Therefore, there are $q^{2}$ elements of the form $a + bi$ in $\mathbb{Z}[i] /(q)$.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that $\mathbb{Z}[i] /(q)$ is a field with $q^{2}$ elements.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\n\nopen Fintype Subgroup Set Polynomial Ideal\nopen scoped BigOperators\n\ntheorem exercise_8_3_6b {q : ℕ} (hq0 : q.Prime)\n  (hq1 : q ≡ 3 [ZMOD 4]) {R : Type} [Ring R]\n  (hR : R = (GaussianInt ⧸ span ({↑q} : Set GaussianInt))) :\n  IsField R ∧ ∃ finR : Fintype R, @card R finR = q^2 :=\nbegin\n  -- We need to show that R is a field and that there exists a finite type finR of R with cardinality q^2.\n  have h1 : IsField R,\n  { -- To show that R is a field, we need to show that the ideal generated by q is maximal.\n    -- Since q is a prime and q ≡ 3 [ZMOD 4], the ideal generated by q is maximal.\n    -- Therefore, the quotient ring R is a field.\n    sorry\n  },\n  have h2 : ∃ finR : Fintype R, @card R finR = q^2,\n  { -- To show that there exists a finite type finR of R with cardinality q^2,\n    -- we need to show that the quotient ring R has q^2 elements.\n    -- Since R is the quotient ring of Gaussian integers by the ideal generated by q,\n    -- and q ≡ 3 [ZMOD 4], the quotient ring R has q^2 elements.\n    sorry\n  },\n  exact ⟨h1, h2⟩,\nend\n```",False

A prime ideal is an ideal such that if the product of two elements is in the ideal, then at least one of the elements must be in the ideal.\n\nWe can show that there are infinitely many minimal prime ideals in this ring by considering the ideals generated by the variables $x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}, \ldots$ individually. For example, the ideal generated by $x_{1}$ is $\left(x_{1}\right)$, and the ideal generated by $x_{2}$ is $\left(x_{2}\right)$.\n\nNotice that these ideals are prime, because if the product of two elements is in one of these ideals, then at least one of the elements must be a multiple of $x_{1}$ or $x_{2}$, respectively.

Since we are working in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$, any proper factor must have integer coefficients.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible degrees of the proper factors. If the degree of one of the factors is $1$, then the other factor must have degree $3$. This is because the total degree of the product is $4$, and the degree of the product of two polynomials is the sum of their degrees.\n\nUsing the theorem that states ""Factors of Polynomial with Integer Coefficients have Integer Coefficients"", we can express $x^4-4x^3+6$ as a product of two polynomials, one of degree $1$ and the other of degree $3$. Let's denote the degree $1$ polynomial as $ax+b$ and the degree $3$ polynomial as $cx^3+dx^2+ex+f$.\n\nWe can then equate the coefficients of the two polynomials to obtain a system of equations.

However, this is a contradiction since we assumed that $ax+b$ is a non-zero polynomial.\n\nTherefore, our assumption that $x^4-4x^3+6$ has a proper factor must be false, and we conclude that $x^4-4x^3+6$ is irreducible in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$.",```lean4\nimport Mathlib\n\nopen Fintype Subgroup Set Polynomial Ideal\nopen scoped BigOperators\n\n/-- Prove that $x^4-4x^3+6$ is irreducible in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$.-/\ntheorem exercise_9_4_2a : Irreducible (X^4 - 4*X^3 + 6 : Polynomial ℤ) := by\n  sorry\n```,False

Then, it must have a proper divisor, which means it can be written as the product of two polynomials, say $p(x)$ and $q(x)$, where both $p(x)$ and $q(x)$ are non-constant.\n\nSince $p(x)$ and $q(x)$ are non-constant, they must have a degree greater than 0. Let's say the degree of $p(x)$ is $m$ and the degree of $q(x)$ is $n$. Then, the degree of $x^4-4x^3+6$ is $m+n$, which is at least 2.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible degrees of $p(x)$ and $q(x)$. If $m=1$, then $p(x)$ is a linear polynomial, and we can write it as $p(x)=ax+b$ for some integers $a$ and $b$. Similarly, if $n=1$, then $q(x)$ is a linear polynomial, and we can write it as $q(x)=cx+d$ for some integers $c$ and $d$.\n\nSince $p(x)$ and $q(x)$ are non-constant, we know that $a\neq 0$ and $c\neq 0$. Therefore, we can divide both sides of the equation $x^4-4x^3+6=p(x)q(x)$ by $ac$ to get:\n\n$$\frac{x^4-4x^3+6}{ac}=p(x)\frac{1}{c}+q(x)\frac{1}{a}$$\n\nNow, let's consider the coefficients of the terms on both sides of the equation. The coefficient of the $x^3$ term on the left-hand side is $-4$, and the coefficient of the $x^3$ term on the right-hand side is $-b/a$ (from the term $p(x)\frac{1}{c}$) plus $d/a$ (from the term $q(x)\frac{1}{a}$). Since these two coefficients must be equal, we have:\n\n$$-4=-\frac{b}{a}+\frac{d}{a}$$\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n$$-4=-\frac{b-d}{a}$$\n\nNow, let's consider the possible values of $a$, $b$, and $d$. Since $a\neq 0$, we know that $a$ is a non-zero integer. Similarly, since $b$ and $d$ are integers, we know that $b-d$ is an integer.\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation above, we get:\n\n$$-4=-\frac{\text{integer}}{\text{non-zero integer}}$$\n\nThis equation is impossible, since the left-hand side is an integer and the right-hand side is a rational number.

This suggests that if it were reducible, it would have a factor of degree 2. \n\nLet's assume that the polynomial has a factor of degree 2, which we can write as $(ax^2+bx+c)(dx^2+ex+f)$, where $a, b, c, d, e, f \in \mathbb{Z}$. \n\nExpanding this product, we get:\n\n$x^4+(ad+be+cf)x^3+(ae^2+2bdf+cf^2)x^2+(af^2+2cdf+be^2)x+cf^2$\n\nComparing coefficients with the original polynomial, we get the following system of equations:\n\n$ad+be+cf=4$\n$ae^2+2bdf+cf^2=6$\n$af^2+2cdf+be^2=2$\n$cf^2=1$\n\nWe can start by solving the last equation for $c$ and $f$. Since $cf^2=1$, we have $c=\pm 1$ and $f=\pm 1$.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where $c=1$ and $f=1$. Substituting these values into the other equations, we get:\n\n$ad+be+1=4$\n$ae^2+2bdf+1=6$\n$af^2+2cdf+be^2=2$\n\nSimplifying these equations, we get:\n\n$ad+be=3$\n$ae^2+2bdf=5$\n$af+2cd+be=1$\n\nWe can try to find integer solutions to this system of equations, but it turns out that there are no solutions. \n\nSimilarly, we can consider the case where $c=-1$ and $f=-1$, and we will also find that there are no solutions.\n\nSince we have exhausted all possible cases, we can conclude that the polynomial $x^4+4x^3+6x^2+2x+1$ has no factors of degree 2, and therefore it is irreducible in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$.\n\nNote that this proof is similar to the one used in the given context, where we assumed that the polynomial had a factor of degree 1 and showed that there were no integer solutions to the resulting system of equations.

In other words, it's a one-to-one correspondence between the elements of the two spaces that preserves the operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication.\n\nWe can start by defining a function $f: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ that maps each vector in $\mathbb{R}^n$ to a real number in $\mathbb{R}$. A natural choice for this function is the one that maps each vector to its sum of components, i.e., $f(\mathbf{x}) = x_1 + x_2 + \ldots + x_n$.\n\nNext, we need to show that this function is a linear transformation. This means that it must preserve the operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication.

By definition of the standard topology, for every point $z = (x,y) \in U$, there exists an open ball $B_\epsilon(z)$ such that $B_\epsilon(z) \subseteq U$. This means that for every point $z \in U$, there exists a radius $\epsilon > 0$ such that all points within a distance $\epsilon$ of $z$ are also in $U$.\n\nNow, let's use the fact that the rationals are everywhere dense in the reals. This means that for every point $z = (x,y) \in U$, we can find a point $s = (x',y')$ such that $x'$ and $y'$ are rational numbers and $s$ is arbitrarily close to $z$. In fact, we can choose $s$ such that the distance between $z$ and $s$ is less than $\frac{\epsilon}{5}$ in both the $x$ and $y$ directions.\n\nLet's denote the point $s$ as $(x',y')$. Then, we can choose a rational number $q$ such that $\frac{\epsilon}{3} < q \leq \frac{2\epsilon}{3}$.

We need to show that $U$ can be expressed as a union of sets from the given collection. Since $U$ is open, for every point $(x, y) \in U$, there exists an open ball $B((x, y), r)$ centered at $(x, y)$ with radius $r > 0$ such that $B((x, y), r) \subseteq U$.\n\nNow, let's consider the point $(x, y) \in U$. We can find rational numbers $a, b, c, d$ such that $a < x < b$, $c < y < d$, and $a, b, c, d$ are all rational. This is because the rational numbers are dense in $\mathbb{R}$, meaning that between any two real numbers, there exists a rational number.\n\nUsing these rational numbers, we can construct a rectangle $R = (a, b) \times (c, d)$ such that $(x, y) \in R \subseteq U$. This is because the open ball $B((x, y), r)$ is contained in $U$, and we can choose $r$ small enough such that the rectangle $R$ is contained in $B((x, y), r)$.\n\nNow, we can express the rectangle $R$ as a product of two open intervals: $R = (a, b) \times (c, d) = (a, b) \times (c, d) \times 1 \times 1$.

Every open set in $\mathbb{R}^2$ can be expressed as a union of sets from the given collection.\n2. The given collection is countable.\n\nLet's start by considering an arbitrary open set $U$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$. We need to show that $U$ can be expressed as a union of sets from the given collection.\n\nLet $(x, y) \in U$. Since $U$ is open, there exists an open ball $B((x, y), r)$ centered at $(x, y)$ with radius $r > 0$ such that $B((x, y), r) \subseteq U$.\n\nNow, let's consider the open intervals $(a, b)$ and $(c, d)$ in $\mathbb{Q}$ such that $a < b$ and $c < d$. We can choose these intervals such that $a < x < b$ and $c < y < d$.\n\nBy the definition of the given collection, the set $(a, b) \times (c, d)$ is an element of the collection. We claim that $(a, b) \times (c, d) \subseteq U$.\n\nTo see this, let $(u, v) \in (a, b) \times (c, d)$. Then $a < u < b$ and $c < v < d$. Since $a < x < b$ and $c < y < d$, we have $x - r < u < x + r$ and $y - r < v < y + r$. Therefore, $(u, v) \in B((x, y), r) \subseteq U$, which shows that $(a, b) \times (c, d) \subseteq U$.\n\nSince $(x, y)$ was an arbitrary point in $U$, we have shown that $U$ can be expressed as a union of sets from the given collection.\n\nNow, let's show that the given collection is countable. We can define a mapping $f: \mathbb{Q} \times \mathbb{Q} \to \{(a, b) \times (c, d) \mid a < b \text{ and } c < d, \text{ and } a, b, c, d \text{ are rational}\}$ by\n\n$$f((a, b), (c, d)) = (a, b) \times (c, d).$$\n\nThis mapping is a surjection, since every element of the given collection is of the form $(a, b) \times (c, d)$ for some rational numbers $a, b, c, d$.\n\nSince $\mathbb{Q} \times \mathbb{Q}$ is countable, the image of $\mathbb{Q} \times \mathbb{Q}$ under the mapping $f$ is also countable. Therefore, the given collection is countable.\n\nWe have shown that the given countable collection is a basis for $\mathbb{R}^2$, since it satisfies the two properties of a basis.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\n\nopen Filter Set TopologicalSpace\nopen scoped Topology\n\ndef rational (x : ℝ) := x ∈ range ((↑) : ℚ → ℝ)\n\ntheorem exercise_16_6\n  (S : Set (Set (ℝ × ℝ)))\n  (hS : ∀ s, s ∈ S → ∃ a b c d, (rational a ∧ rational b ∧ rational c ∧ rational d\n  ∧ s = {x | ∃ x₁ x₂, x = (x₁, x₂) ∧ a < x₁ ∧ x₁ < b ∧ c < x₂ ∧ x₂ < d})) :\n  IsTopologicalBasis S :=\nbegin\n  refine isTopologicalBasis_of_open_of_nhds (λ s hs, _) (λ x U hxU, _),\n  { rcases hS s hs with ⟨a, b, c, d, ha, hb, hc, hd, rfl⟩,\n    exact isOpen_Ioo.preimage continuous_fst.prod_mk continuous_snd.prod_mk },\n  { rcases hS U hxU with ⟨a, b, c, d, ha, hb, hc, hd, rfl⟩,\n    refine ⟨Ioo a b ×ˢ Ioo c d, ⟨⟨a, b, c, d, ha, hb, hc, hd, rfl⟩, ⟨⟨a, b, c, d, ha, hb, hc, hd, rfl⟩⟩, ?_⟩,\n    exact ⟨⟨a, b, c, d, ha, hb, hc, hd, rfl⟩⟩ },\nend\n```",False

This set is open in $X$ because the inverse image of any open set in $Y$ under $f$ or $g$ is open in $X$. In particular, the inverse image of the open set $(g(x), \infty)$ in $Y$ under $f$ is the set $A$, which is therefore open.\n\nSimilarly, let's consider the set $B = \{x \in X \mid f(x) > g(x)\}$.

This set is closed in $X$ because it is the intersection of the closed sets $A$ and $B$. In fact, we can see that $C = A \cap B$.\n\nWe can now use the Pasting Lemma for Continuous Mappings on Closed Sets to show that the set $\{x \mid f(x) \leq g(x)\}$ is closed in $X$. To do this, we need to define two continuous mappings $f_A$ and $f_B$ from $A$ and $B$ to $Y$, respectively, such that they agree on $C = A \cap B$.\n\nWe can define $f_A$ to be the restriction of $f$ to $A$, and $f_B$ to be the restriction of $g$ to $B$. Both $f_A$ and $f_B$ are continuous because they are restrictions of the continuous mappings $f$ and $g$, respectively.\n\nWe can also see that $f_A$ and $f_B$ agree on $C = A \cap B$ because $f(x) = g(x)$ for all $x \in C$.\n\nNow, we can use the Pasting Lemma to show that the mapping $f \cup g$ from $A \cup B$ to $Y$ is continuous. This mapping is defined to be the union of the mappings $f_A$ and $f_B$, and it is continuous because it is the union of two continuous mappings that agree on the intersection of their domains.\n\nFinally, we can see that the set $\{x \mid f(x) \leq g(x)\}$ is equal to the set $A \cup C$, where $C = \{x \in X \mid f(x) = g(x)\}$.

This set is the complement of the set we're interested in, and we can show that it's open by using the continuity of $f$ and $g$.\n\nFor any $x \in A$, there exists an open neighborhood $U$ of $x$ such that $f(y) < g(y)$ for all $y \in U$. This is because $f$ and $g$ are continuous, so they preserve open sets. Since $f(x) < g(x)$, we can find an open interval $(f(x), g(x))$ that contains $f(x)$ and is contained in the set of values that $g$ takes on $U$. By the definition of the order topology, this interval is open in $Y$.

",0,1,13085,"# Informal Proof:\n\nTo show that $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$ in the dictionary order topology is metrizable, we can start by recalling the definition of metrizability. A topological space is metrizable if it is homeomorphic to a metric space. In other words, we need to find a metric on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$ that induces the dictionary order topology.\n\nThe dictionary order topology on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$ is defined as follows: a set $U \subseteq \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$ is open if for every point $(x, y) \in U$, there exists an open interval $(a, b) \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ such that $(x, y) \in (a, b) \times \mathbb{R}$ and $(a, b) \times \mathbb{R} \subseteq U$.\n\nTo construct a metric on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$ that induces this topology, we can use the fact that the dictionary order on $\mathbb{R}$ is equivalent to the standard ordering on $\mathbb{R}$. This means that for any two points $x, y \in \mathbb{R}$, we can write $x < y$ in the dictionary order if and only if $x < y$ in the standard ordering.\n\nUsing this equivalence, we can define a metric $d$ on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$ as follows:\n\n$$d((x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2)) = |x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|$$\n\nThis metric is clearly symmetric and satisfies the triangle inequality, so it is a valid metric on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$.\n\nTo show that this metric induces the dictionary order topology, we need to show that every open set in the dictionary order topology is open in the metric topology induced by $d$, and vice versa.\n\nLet $U$ be an open set in the dictionary order topology. Then for every point $(x, y) \in U$, there exists an open interval $(a, b) \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ such that $(x, y) \in (a, b) \times \mathbb{R}$ and $(a, b) \times \mathbb{R} \subseteq U$. We can write $a = x - \epsilon$ and $b = x + \epsilon$ for some $\epsilon > 0$. Then the open ball $B_d((x, y), \epsilon)$ is contained in $(a, b) \times \mathbb{R}$, and therefore $B_d((x, y), \epsilon) \subseteq U$. This shows that $U$ is open in the metric topology induced by $d$.\n\nConversely, let $V$ be an open set in the metric topology induced by $d$. Then for every point $(x, y) \in V$, there exists an $\epsilon > 0$ such that $B_d((x, y), \epsilon) \subseteq V$. We can write $B_d((x, y), \epsilon) = \{(u, v) \in \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} : |u - x| + |v - y| < \epsilon\}$. This set is an open rectangle in the dictionary order topology, and therefore $V$ is open in the dictionary order topology.\n\nThis shows that the metric $d$ induces the dictionary order topology on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$, and therefore $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$ in the dictionary order topology is metrizable.",```lean4\nimport Mathlib\n\nopen Filter Set TopologicalSpace\nopen scoped Topology\n\n/-- Show that $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$ in the dictionary order topology is metrizable.-/\ntheorem exercise_20_2\n  [TopologicalSpace (ℝ ×ₗ ℝ)] [OrderTopology (ℝ ×ₗ ℝ)]\n  : MetrizableSpace (ℝ ×ₗ ℝ) :=\n```,False

This topology is defined as the coarsest topology such that the projection maps $\pi_1: \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ and $\pi_2: \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ are continuous. \n\nTo show that $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$ in the dictionary order topology is metrizable, we can use the fact that the product of two second-countable spaces is also second-countable. \n\nSince $\mathbb{R}$ is second-countable, we know that it has a countable basis $\BB$. We can then use the fact that the product of two countable sets is countable to show that the set $\BB \times \BB$ is countable. \n\nThe set $\BB \times \BB$ consists of all pairs of open intervals $(\openint a b, \openint c d)$, where $a, b, c, d \in \mathbb{Q}$ and $a < b$ and $c < d$. \n\nWe can define a mapping $f: \mathbb{Q} \times \mathbb{Q} \times \mathbb{Q} \times \mathbb{Q} \to \BB \times \BB$ by $f(q_1, q_2, q_3, q_4) = (\openint q_1 q_2, \openint q_3 q_4)$. \n\nThis mapping is a surjection, and since $\mathbb{Q} \times \mathbb{Q} \times \mathbb{Q} \times \mathbb{Q}$ is countable, we can conclude that $\BB \times \BB$ is also countable. \n\nNow, let's consider the dictionary order topology on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$.

Since $p \circ f$ equals the identity map of $Y$, we have $p(f(y)) = y$. Now, consider the composition $p \circ g \circ f$. Since $p \circ g$ is constant, we have $p \circ g \circ f(y) = p \circ g(y)$ for any $y \in Y$. But $p \circ g \circ f(y) = p(f(g(y))) = g(y)$, since $p(f(y)) = y$ for any $y \in Y$.

Since $G$ is a topological group, the group operation (multiplication) is continuous. This means that the product of two connected subsets of $G$ is also connected. In particular, the product of $C$ with itself, $C \cdot C$, is connected.\n\nNow, since $C$ contains $e$, we have that $C \cdot C$ contains $e$ as well. Moreover, since $C$ is connected, it is path-connected, meaning that there exists a continuous path from $e$ to any other element of $C$. This implies that $C \cdot C$ is also path-connected.\n\nSince $C \cdot C$ is connected and path-connected, it must be equal to $C$. This shows that $C$ is closed under the group operation.\n\nNext, we need to show that $C$ is closed under inversion. Since $G$ is a topological group, the inversion map $x \mapsto x^{-1}$ is continuous. This means that the preimage of $C$ under this map, which is the set of inverses of elements of $C$, is also connected.\n\nSince $C$ contains $e$, the set of inverses of elements of $C$ contains $e$ as well.

This is because $C$ is a connected component of $G$, and connected components are always closed subsets of the group. Since $G$ is a topological group, it is a Hausdorff space, and in a Hausdorff space, connected components are closed subgroups. Therefore, $C$ is a closed subgroup of $G$.\n\nNext, we need to show that $C$ is a normal subgroup of $G$. To do this, we can use the fact that $C$ is a connected component of $G$. Let $g \in G$ be any element, and let $h \in C$ be any element of $C$. We need to show that $g^{-1}hg \in C$.\n\nSince $C$ is a connected component of $G$, it is a maximal connected subset of $G$. Therefore, the set $g^{-1}Cg$ is also a connected subset of $G$. But $g^{-1}Cg$ is a connected subset of $G$ that contains the identity element $e$, since $g^{-1}eg = e$.

This homeomorphism preserves the connectedness of subsets of $G$, which allows us to conclude that $g^{-1}Cg$ is contained in $C$.\n\nThis proof relies on the fact that connected components are closed subgroups in a Hausdorff space, and the fact that the conjugation map is a homeomorphism of $G$ onto itself.

Since $C$ is a connected component of $G$, it is a closed subset of $G$. The identity element $e$ is in $C$, and since $C$ is closed, it contains all its limit points. In a topological group, the group operation is continuous, so the product of any two elements in $C$ is also in $C$. Furthermore, since $C$ is a connected component, it is path-connected, and the inverse of any element in $C$ is also in $C$.

Therefore, the preimage of $N$ under $\pi_I$ must be a neighborhood of $x$ in the uniform topology, but this preimage is a compact set in the product topology on $[0, 1]^I$, which is a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, our assumption that there exists a compact neighborhood of $x$ in the uniform topology must be false, and we conclude that $[0, 1]^\omega$ is not locally compact in the uniform topology.\n\nNote that this proof is similar to the proof that the irrational number space is not locally compact Hausdorff space, but it uses the specific properties of the uniform topology and the product topology to reach the desired conclusion.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\n\nopen Filter Set TopologicalSpace\nopen scoped Topology\n\nabbrev I : Set ℝ := Icc 0 1\n\n/-- Show that $[0, 1]^\omega$ is not locally compact in the uniform topology.-/\ntheorem exercise_29_4 [TopologicalSpace (ℕ → I)] :\n  ¬ LocallyCompactSpace (ℕ → I) := by\n  intro h\n  have : LocallyCompactSpace (ℕ → I) := h\n  exact Compactness.locallyCompactSpace_of_finite_subfamily_closed (ℕ → I)\n    (fun _ => isClosed_Icc) (fun _ => isCompact_Icc)\n```",False

This means that for each $\alpha \in I$, there exists a countable everywhere dense subset $D_\alpha$ of $\struct {S_\alpha, \tau_\alpha}$.\n\nWe then form the product space $\struct {S, \tau} = \prod_{\alpha \mathop \in I} \struct {S_\alpha, \tau_\alpha}$, which is also a topological space. Our goal is to show that this product space is separable, i.e., it has a countable dense subset.\n\nTo achieve this, we define a set $D$ as the countable product of the dense subsets $D_\alpha$, i.e., $D = \ds \prod_{\alpha \mathop \in I} D_\alpha$. Since each $D_\alpha$ is countable, the countable union of countable sets is countable, and therefore $D$ is a countable set.\n\nNext, we need to show that $D$ is an everywhere dense subset in the product space $\struct {S, \tau}$. To do this, we use the fact that the set $\BB$ of cartesian products of the form $\ds \prod_{\alpha \mathop \in I} U_\alpha$ is a basis for the topology $\tau$ on the product space. This means that any open set in the product space can be expressed as a union of sets in $\BB$.\n\nNow, let $U$ be any set in $\BB$. We need to show that $U \cap D \ne \O$, i.e., that $U$ intersects the set $D$ non-trivially. To do this, we consider the sets $U_\alpha = U \cap S_\alpha$ for each $\alpha \in I$. Since $U$ is in $\BB$, we know that for all but finitely many indices $\alpha$, $U_\alpha = X_\alpha$ for some $X_\alpha \in \tau_\alpha$.\n\nFor each $\alpha \in I$, we can choose a point $x_\alpha \in U_\alpha \cap D_\alpha$. This is possible because $D_\alpha$ is dense in $S_\alpha$, and $U_\alpha$ is a non-empty open set in $S_\alpha$. We then form the point $x = \family{x_\alpha}_{\alpha \in I}$ in the product space.\n\nUsing the fact that the product of intersections is equal to the intersection of products, we can show that $x \in U \cap D$. This is because $x_\alpha \in U_\alpha \cap D_\alpha$ for each $\alpha \in I$, and therefore $x \in \prod_{\alpha \mathop \in I} (U_\alpha \cap D_\alpha) = U \cap D$.\n\nSince $x \in U \cap D$, we have shown that $U \cap D \ne \O$. This is true for any set $U$ in $\BB$, and therefore $D$ is an everywhere dense subset in the product space $\struct {S, \tau}$.\n\nFinally, since $D$ is a countable set, we have shown that the countable product of spaces having countable dense subsets also has a countable dense subset.

We can use this property to construct disjoint open sets around each point in $V_1$ and $V_2$.\n\nLet's consider a point $x \in V_1$. Since $V_1$ and $V_2$ are disjoint, $x \not \in V_2$. Using the Hausdorff property, for each $y \in V_2$, we can find an open neighborhood $O^1_y$ of $x$ and an open neighborhood $O^2_y$ of $y$ such that $O^1_y \cap O^2_y = \O$.\n\nSince $V_2$ is compact, we can find a finite number of points $y_1, \ldots, y_n \in V_2$ such that $V_2 \subseteq \bigcup_{i \mathop = 1}^n O_{y_i}^2$. Let's define $U_2 = \bigcup_{i \mathop = 1}^n O_{y_i}^2$ and $U_1 = \bigcap_{i \mathop = 1}^n O_{y_i}^1$. We can see that $U_1$ and $U_2$ are open sets, $x \in U_1$, and $V_2 \subseteq U_2$.\n\nNow, if $x \in U_2$, then $x \in O_{y_i}^2$ for some $i$.

But then, since $z \in U_2$, we have $z \in U_{x_i}$, which implies that $\overline{V_{x_i}} \cap \overline{O_z} \neq \emptyset$.

Moreover, since $A \times \prod X_\beta \subseteq U'$ and $B \times \prod X_\beta \subseteq V'$, we have $A \subseteq U$ and $B \subseteq V$.\n\nFinally, since $U'$ and $V'$ are disjoint, we have $U$ and $V$ are also disjoint.\n\nTherefore, we have found two disjoint open sets $U$ and $V$ in $X_\alpha$ such that $A \subseteq U$ and $B \subseteq V$. This shows that $X_\alpha$ is normal.\n\nWe have shown that if the product space $\prod X_\alpha$ is normal, then each factor space $X_\alpha$ is also normal.

",0,1,66215,"# Informal Proof:\n\nTo show that every locally compact Hausdorff space is completely regular, we'll start by recalling the definition of complete regularity. A topological space is completely regular if for any closed set C and any point x not in C, there exists a continuous function f from the space to the real numbers such that f(x) = 0 and f(C) = 1.\n\nGiven a locally compact Hausdorff space X, we know that every point x in X has a neighborhood basis of compact sets. This means that for any open set U containing x, there exists a compact set K contained in U such that x is in the interior of K.\n\nNow, let's consider a closed set C in X and a point x not in C. Since X is Hausdorff, we can separate x from C by open sets U and V, where U contains x and V contains C. By the local compactness of X, there exists a compact set K contained in U such that x is in the interior of K.\n\nWe can use the Urysohn's Lemma for compact Hausdorff spaces, which states that for any compact Hausdorff space and any two disjoint closed sets, there exists a continuous function from the space to the real numbers that separates the two sets. In our case, we can apply Urysohn's Lemma to the compact set K and the closed set C ∩ K, which is a closed set in K.\n\nThis gives us a continuous function f from K to the real numbers such that f(x) = 0 and f(C ∩ K) = 1. We can then extend f to a continuous function g from X to the real numbers by setting g(y) = f(y) for y in K and g(y) = 0 for y not in K.\n\nNow, we need to show that g(C) = 1. Since C is closed in X, it contains C ∩ K. Therefore, g(C) ≥ f(C ∩ K) = 1. On the other hand, since g is continuous and C is closed, we have g(C) ≤ 1. Therefore, g(C) = 1.\n\nThis shows that X is completely regular, as required.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\n\nopen Filter Set TopologicalSpace\nopen scoped Topology\n\nabbrev I : Set ℝ := Icc 0 1\n\n/-- Show that every locally compact Hausdorff space is completely regular.-/\ntheorem exercise_33_7 {X : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X]\n  (hX : LocallyCompactSpace X) (hX' : T2Space X) :\n  ∀ x A, IsClosed A ∧ ¬ x ∈ A →\n  ∃ (f : X → I), Continuous f ∧ f x = 1 ∧ f '' A = {0} := by\n  intro x A hA\n  have hA' : IsClosed A := hA.1\n  have hxA : x ∉ A := hA.2\n  -- Since X is locally compact Hausdorff, we can find a compact set K containing a neighborhood of x\n  obtain ⟨K, hK, hxK, hKc⟩ := hX.local_compact_nhds x (𝓝 x)\n  -- Apply Urysohn's lemma to the compact set K and the closed set A ∩ K\n  obtain ⟨f, hf⟩ := exists_continuous_zero_one_of_is_closed_of_is_open hKc hA' (isOpen_compl_iff.mpr hK) ⟨hxK, hxA⟩\n  -- Define the function g : X → I by g(y) = f(y) for y ∈ K and g(y) = 0 for y ∉ K\n  let g : X → I := fun y => if y ∈ K then ⟨f y, hf.1 y⟩ else ⟨0, left_mem_Icc.mpr zero_le_one⟩\n  -- Show that g is continuous\n  have hg : Continuous g := by\n    apply continuous_if_const\n    · intro y hy\n      exact ⟨hf.1 y, fun h => h.2 rfl⟩\n    · exact continuous_const\n  -- Show that g(x) = 1 and g(A) = {0}\n  have hgx : g x = ⟨1, right_mem_Icc.mpr zero_le_one⟩ := by\n    have hxK' : x ∈ K := hxK\n    simp only [g, hxK', if_true]\n    exact hf.2.1\n  have hgA : g '' A = {0} := by\n    ext z\n    simp only [mem_image, mem_singleton_iff]\n    constructor\n    · rintro ⟨y, hyA, rfl⟩\n      have hyA' : y ∈ A := hyA\n      have hyK : y ∉ K := by\n        intro hyK\n        exact hxA (hA' hyA')\n      simp only [g, hyK, if_false]\n      rfl\n    · intro hz\n      obtain ⟨y, hyA, hyK⟩ := hX'.exists_mem_of_ne hxA\n      use y, hyA\n      simp only [g, hyK, if_false]\n      exact hz\n  -- Return the function g\n  exact ⟨g, hg, hgx, hgA⟩\n```",False

",0,1,96411,"# Informal Proof:\n\nTo prove that a uniformly continuous function $f$ defined on a subset $A$ of a metric space $X$ can be uniquely extended to a continuous function $g$ on the closure of $A$, we start by considering a sequence $\{a_n\}$ in $A$ that converges to a point $a$ in the closure of $A$. \n\nSince $f$ is uniformly continuous, we know that the sequence $\{f(a_n)\}$ converges to some point in the metric space $Y$. Let's denote this limit as $g(a)$. This gives us a way to ""fill in"" the missing values in the closure of $A$ by considering limits of sequences of the form $\{f(a_n)\}$ where $a_n \to a$.\n\nHowever, we need to show that this limit is the same regardless of the choice of sequence $\{a_n\}$. Suppose we have two sequences $\{a_n\}$ and $\{b_n\}$ in $A$ that both converge to the same point $a$ in the closure of $A$. Since $f$ is uniformly continuous, we know that the sequences $\{f(a_n)\}$ and $\{f(b_n)\}$ both converge to the same point in $Y$. This implies that the limits $g(a)$ obtained from both sequences are the same.\n\nNow, we need to show that the function $g$ obtained in this way is continuous. Let $\{a_n\}$ be a sequence in $A$ that converges to a point $a$ in the closure of $A$. We want to show that the sequence $\{g(a_n)\}$ converges to $g(a)$. Since $f$ is uniformly continuous, we know that the sequence $\{f(a_n)\}$ converges to $g(a)$. But we also know that the sequence $\{g(a_n)\}$ converges to $g(a)$ by definition of $g$. Therefore, we have shown that $g$ is continuous.\n\nFinally, we need to show that the function $g$ is uniformly continuous. Let $\epsilon > 0$ be given. Since $f$ is uniformly continuous, there exists a $\delta > 0$ such that $d_Y(f(a), f(b)) < \epsilon$ whenever $d_X(a, b) < \delta$. Now, let $a$ and $b$ be points in the closure of $A$ such that $d_X(a, b) < \delta$. We can find sequences $\{a_n\}$ and $\{b_n\}$ in $A$ that converge to $a$ and $b$, respectively.

This implies that the sequence $\{f(a_n)\}$ is a Cauchy sequence in $Y$.\n\nSince $Y$ is a complete metric space, every Cauchy sequence in $Y$ converges to a point in $Y$. Therefore, the sequence $\{f(a_n)\}$ converges to a point $y \in Y$. We claim that $y = f(a)$.\n\nTo show this, let $\epsilon > 0$ be given. Since $f$ is uniformly continuous, there exists a $\delta > 0$ such that for all $x, y \in A$, if $d_X(x, y) < \delta$, then $d_Y(f(x), f(y)) < \epsilon$.

Each term in the sum is a fraction of the form $\frac{1}{k}$, where $k$ is a positive integer greater than 1.\n\nNotice that the sum is a series of fractions with denominators that are consecutive integers. This suggests a connection to the harmonic series, which is known to diverge. However, our goal is not to prove divergence, but rather to show that the sum is not an integer.\n\nLet's consider the sum for a specific value of $n$, say $n=2$. In this case, the sum is $\frac{1}{2}$. This is not an integer, so we have a base case to work with.\n\nNow, let's assume that the sum is an integer for some value of $n$. We can write this as:\n\n$$\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}+\cdots+\frac{1}{n} = k$$\n\nwhere $k$ is an integer.\n\nWe can then consider the sum for $n+1$, which is:\n\n$$\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}+\cdots+\frac{1}{n}+\frac{1}{n+1}$$\n\nUsing our assumption that the sum is an integer for $n$, we can rewrite this as:\n\n$$k+\frac{1}{n+1}$$\n\nNow, we can examine the properties of this new sum. Notice that the term $\frac{1}{n+1}$ is a fraction with a denominator that is a positive integer. This means that the sum $k+\frac{1}{n+1}$ is a sum of an integer and a fraction.\n\nSince $k$ is an integer, we can write it as $k = m \cdot (n+1)$ for some integer $m$. Then, we can rewrite the sum as:\n\n$$m \cdot (n+1) + \frac{1}{n+1}$$\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\n$$(m+1) \cdot (n+1)$$\n\nThis is an integer, since $m+1$ is an integer and $(n+1)$ is a positive integer.\n\nHowever, this means that the sum $k+\frac{1}{n+1}$ is an integer, which contradicts our assumption that the sum is not an integer for $n+1$. This contradiction shows that our assumption that the sum is an integer for some value of $n$ must be false.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the sum $\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}+\cdots+\frac{1}{n}$ is not an integer for any value of $n$.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\n\nopen Real\nopen scoped BigOperators\n\n/-- Prove that $\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}+\cdots+\frac{1}{n}$ is not an integer.-/\ntheorem exercise_1_30 {n : ℕ} :\n  ¬ ∃ a : ℤ, ∑ i : Fin n, (1 : ℚ) / (n+2) = a := by\n  intro h\n  cases' h with a h\n  have : ∑ i : Fin n, (1 : ℚ) / (n+2) = a := h\n  simp [Finset.sum_range_succ, add_comm] at this\n  norm_cast at this\n  linarith\n```",False

We are dealing with a sum of fractions, where each term is of the form $\frac{1}{k}$, where $k$ is a positive integer.\n\nNotice that the sequence starts with $\frac{1}{2}$, which is not an integer. This already suggests that the sum may not be an integer, as the sum of a non-integer and other terms is unlikely to result in an integer.\n\nHowever, let's proceed with a more formal approach. Consider the sequence $\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{4}, \ldots, \frac{1}{n}$. We can rewrite each term as a fraction with a denominator of $n!$ (the factorial of $n$), which is the product of all positive integers up to $n$.\n\nFor example, $\frac{1}{2} = \frac{1 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdots (n-1) \cdot n}{2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdots (n-1) \cdot n}$, $\frac{1}{3} = \frac{1 \cdot 2 \cdot 4 \cdots (n-1) \cdot n}{3 \cdot 2 \cdot 4 \cdots (n-1) \cdot n}$, and so on.\n\nWhen we add these fractions together, we get a single fraction with a denominator of $n!$. The numerator will be the sum of the numerators of each term, which is $1 + 1 + 1 + \cdots + 1$ (with $n$ ones).\n\nThis sum is equal to $n$, which is not a multiple of $n!$. Therefore, the fraction $\frac{n}{n!}$ is not an integer, as it cannot be expressed as a ratio of two integers.\n\nSince the sum $\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}+\cdots+\frac{1}{n}$ is equal to $\frac{n}{n!}$, we conclude that it is not an integer.\n\nThis proof relies on the fact that the sum of a sequence of fractions can be rewritten as a single fraction with a denominator of $n!$, and that the numerator of this fraction is not a multiple of $n!$.

In this case, we can express $a$ as $a = 2k + 1$ for some integer $k$. Now, let's examine the expression $a^{2^{n}}+1$. Since $a$ is odd, $a^{2^{n}}$ will also be odd, and adding $1$ to an odd number results in an even number. This means that $a^{2^{n}}+1$ is even.\n\nSimilarly, $a^{2^{m}}+1$ is also even. Now, we need to show that these two even numbers are coprime, i.e., their greatest common divisor is $1$ or $2$. To do this, let's assume that they have a common divisor $d$.

Also, note that all prime numbers are greater than or equal to $2$.\n\nThus, it follows that:\n\n$$-\frac 2 {p_k^2} < \ln \left(1 - \frac 1 {p_k^2}\right)$$\n\nApplying this to the previous inequality, we get:\n\n$$-2 \sum_{k \mathop = 1}^n \frac 1 {p_k^2} < -\ln \ln p_n^2$$\n\nand so:\n\n$$\sum_{k \mathop = 1}^n \frac 1 {p_k^2} > \frac 1 2 \ln \ln p_n^2$$\n\nBut:\n\n$$\lim_{n \mathop \to \infty} \ln \ln p_n^2 \to \infty$$\n\nand so the sum of reciprocals of square-free integers is divergent.\n\nNote that this proof is similar to the proof that the sum of reciprocals of primes is divergent, but with some modifications to account for the fact that we are dealing with square-free integers instead of prime numbers.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\n\nopen Real\nopen scoped BigOperators\n\n/-- Show that $\sum^{\prime} 1 / n$, the sum being over square free integers, diverges.-/\ntheorem exercise_2_27a :\n  ¬ Summable (λ i : {p : ℤ // Squarefree p} => (1 : ℚ) / i) :=\n  sorry\n```",False

",0,1,47787,"# Informal Proof:\n\nTo prove that the equation $3x^{2}+2=y^{2}$ has no solution in integers, we can start by examining the given Diophantine equation $y^3 = x^2 + 2$. We are given that this equation has only one solution in the Natural Numbers: $x = 5, y = 3$.\n\nFirst, let's consider the properties of the equation $y^3 = x^2 + 2$. We can see that the left-hand side (LHS) is a perfect cube, while the right-hand side (RHS) is a quadratic expression plus 2. This suggests that the LHS and RHS have different parity properties.\n\nLet's assume that $x$ is even. Then, we can rewrite $x$ as $x = 2k$, where $k$ is an integer. Substituting this into the equation, we get $y^3 = (2k)^2 + 2 = 4k^2 + 2 = 2(2k^2 + 1)$. This implies that the RHS is congruent to 2 modulo 4.\n\nNow, let's consider the parity of $y$. If $y$ is odd, then the LHS will be odd. On the other hand, if $y$ is even, then the LHS will be congruent to 0 modulo 4. However, we know that the RHS is congruent to 2 modulo 4, which is a contradiction. Therefore, $y$ must be odd.\n\nSince $y$ is odd, we can rewrite $y$ as $y = 2s + 1$, where $s$ is an integer. Substituting this into the equation, we get $x = y + a$, where $a$ is an integer. We can rewrite $x$ as $x = 2s + 1 + 2k$, where $k$ is an integer.\n\nNow, let's consider the parity of $a$. We know that $x$ and $y$ are both odd, so $a$ must be even. Therefore, we can rewrite $a$ as $a = 2k$, where $k$ is an integer.\n\nSubstituting $a = 2k$ into the equation, we get $y^3 = (y + 2k)^2 + 2$. Expanding the RHS, we get $y^3 = y^2 + 2ay + a^2 + 2$. Subtracting $y^2$ from both sides, we get $y^3 - y^2 = 2ay + a^2 + 2$.\n\nFactoring the LHS, we get $y^2(y - 1) = 2(ay + \frac{a^2}{2} + 1)$. Since $y$ is odd, $y - 1$ is even. The only even term on the RHS is 2, so we must have $y - 1 = 2$. Therefore, $y = 3$ and $x = 5$.\n\nNow, let's consider the equation $3x^{2}+2=y^{2}$. We can rewrite this equation as $y^2 = 3x^2 + 2$. Since we know that $x = 5$ and $y = 3$ is the only solution to the equation $y^3 = x^2 + 2$, we can substitute these values into the equation.\n\nSubstituting $x = 5$ and $y = 3$ into the equation, we get $3(5)^2 + 2 = 3(25) + 2 = 77$. However, $3(5)^2 + 2 = 77$ is not equal to $3^2 = 9$. Therefore, the equation $3x^{2}+2=y^{2}$ has no solution in integers.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\n\nopen Real\nopen scoped BigOperators\n\n/-- Show that the equation $3 x^{2}+2=y^{2}$ has no solution in integers.-/\ntheorem exercise_3_4 : ¬ ∃ x y : ℤ, 3*x^2 + 2 = y^2 := by\n  intro h\n  rcases h with ⟨x, y, h⟩\n  have h1 : y^2 % 4 = 0 ∨ y^2 % 4 = 1 ∨ y^2 % 4 = 4 := by\n    have : y % 4 = 0 ∨ y % 4 = 1 ∨ y % 4 = 2 ∨ y % 4 = 3 := by omega\n    rcases this with (h | h | h | h) <;> simp [h, pow_two, Int.mul_emod, Int.add_emod]\n  have h2 : 3*x^2 % 4 = 0 ∨ 3*x^2 % 4 = 3 := by\n    have : x % 4 = 0 ∨ x % 4 = 1 ∨ x % 4 = 2 ∨ x % 4 = 3 := by omega\n    rcases this with (h | h | h | h) <;> simp [h, pow_two, Int.mul_emod, Int.add_emod]\n  have h3 : (3*x^2 + 2) % 4 = 2 := by simp [Int.add_emod, h2]\n  have h4 : y^2 % 4 = 2 := by simp [h, h3]\n  omega\n```",False

Similarly, an odd integer is any integer that can be written in the form $2k+1$, where $k$ is an integer.\n\nNow, let's consider the equation $3 x^{2}+2=y^{2}$. We can rewrite this equation as $y^2 = 3x^2 + 2$.\n\nNotice that the right-hand side of the equation is always even, since it is the sum of an even number ($3x^2$) and an even number ($2$).

Since $x$ is an integer, $x^2$ is also an integer. Therefore, $3x^2$ is a multiple of $3$.\n\nSince $y^2$ is even and $3x^2$ is a multiple of $3$, we can write $y^2 = 2(2k^2 + 1)$ for some integer $k$.\n\nHowever, this is a contradiction, because $y^2$ is even, but $2(2k^2 + 1)$ is odd.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that the equation $3 x^{2}+2=y^{2}$ has no solution in integers.\n\nNote that this proof is similar to the proof of the original problem, which showed that the equation $y^3 = x^2 + 2$ has only one solution in the natural numbers.

If $x$ is even, then we can write $x = 2k$ for some integer $k$. Substituting this into the equation, we get $y^3 = (2k)^2 + 2 = 4k^2 + 2 = 2(2k^2 + 1)$. This implies that $y^3 \equiv 2 \pmod 4$, which means that $y$ must be odd.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where $y$ is odd. If $y$ is odd, then we can write $y = 2s + 1$ for some integer $s$. Substituting this into the equation, we get $y^3 = (2s + 1)^3 = 8s^3 + 12s^2 + 6s + 1$. This implies that $y^3 \equiv 1 \pmod 4$, which means that $y$ must be odd.\n\nHowever, if $y$ is odd, then $y^3$ is also odd, and we have $y^3 = x^2 + 2$.

",0,1,6007,"# Informal Proof:\n\nTo tackle this problem, we need to understand the relationship between binomial coefficients and the properties of prime numbers. The given theorem, Binomial Coefficient of Prime Minus One Modulo Prime, provides a crucial insight into this connection.\n\nLet's start by examining the expression we need to prove: $1^{k}+2^{k}+\cdots+(p-1)^{k}$. We can rewrite this expression using the binomial theorem, which states that $(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k}b^k$. However, in this case, we're dealing with a sum of powers of consecutive integers, not a binomial expansion.\n\nInstead, we can use the fact that the binomial coefficient $\binom{p-1}{k}$ is equivalent to $(-1)^k \pmod{p}$, as stated in the theorem. This means that for any $k$ between $0$ and $p-1$, we have $\binom{p-1}{k} \equiv (-1)^k \pmod{p}$.\n\nNow, let's consider the sum $1^{k}+2^{k}+\cdots+(p-1)^{k}$. We can rewrite this sum as $\sum_{i=1}^{p-1} i^k$. This sum can be expressed in terms of binomial coefficients using the formula for the sum of powers of consecutive integers: $\sum_{i=1}^{p-1} i^k = \frac{(p-1)^{k+1} - 1}{p-1}$.\n\nHowever, we can also express this sum using the binomial theorem. We can write the sum as $\sum_{i=1}^{p-1} i^k = \sum_{i=1}^{p-1} \binom{p-1}{i} i^k$. Using the fact that $\binom{p-1}{i} \equiv (-1)^i \pmod{p}$, we can rewrite this sum as $\sum_{i=1}^{p-1} (-1)^i i^k$.\n\nNow, let's consider the two cases: $p-1 \nmid k$ and $p-1 \mid k$. If $p-1 \nmid k$, then we can use the fact that $\binom{p-1}{k} \equiv (-1)^k \pmod{p}$ to rewrite the sum as $\sum_{i=1}^{p-1} (-1)^i i^k = (-1)^k \sum_{i=1}^{p-1} i^k$.\n\nUsing the formula for the sum of powers of consecutive integers, we can rewrite this sum as $(-1)^k \frac{(p-1)^{k+1} - 1}{p-1}$. Since $p-1 \nmid k$, we know that $p-1$ does not divide the numerator of this expression. Therefore, the expression is equivalent to $0 \pmod{p}$.\n\nOn the other hand, if $p-1 \mid k$, then we can use the fact that $\binom{p-1}{k} \equiv (-1)^k \pmod{p}$ to rewrite the sum as $\sum_{i=1}^{p-1} (-1)^i i^k = (-1)^k \sum_{i=1}^{p-1} i^k$. Using the formula for the sum of powers of consecutive integers, we can rewrite this sum as $(-1)^k \frac{(p-1)^{k+1} - 1}{p-1}$.\n\nSince $p-1 \mid k$, we know that $p-1$ divides the numerator of this expression. Therefore, the expression is equivalent to $-1 \pmod{p}$.\n\nIn conclusion, we have shown that the sum $1^{k}+2^{k}+\cdots+(p-1)^{k}$ is equivalent to $0 \pmod{p}$ if $p-1 \nmid k$ and $-1 \pmod{p}$ if $p-1 \mid k$.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\n\nopen Real\nopen scoped BigOperators\n\ntheorem exercise_4_11 {p : ℕ} (hp : p.Prime) (k s: ℕ)\n  (s := ∑ n : Fin p, (n : ℕ) ^ k) :\n  ((¬ p - 1 ∣ k) → s ≡ 0 [MOD p]) ∧ (p - 1 ∣ k → s ≡ 0 [MOD p]) := by\n  /-\n  To prove the theorem, we need to show that the sum \(1^k + 2^k + \cdots + (p-1)^k\) is congruent to 0 modulo \(p\) if \(p-1 \nmid k\) and congruent to \(-1\) modulo \(p\) if \(p-1 \mid k\).\n  1. **Sum Representation**: The sum \(1^k + 2^k + \cdots + (p-1)^k\) can be represented as \(\sum_{i=1}^{p-1} i^k\).\n  2. **Binomial Coefficient Property**: Using the property of binomial coefficients, we know that \(\binom{p-1}{k} \equiv (-1)^k \pmod{p}\).\n  3. **Sum of Powers**: The sum of powers can be expressed using the binomial theorem, leading to \(\sum_{i=1}^{p-1} i^k = \frac{(p-1)^{k+1} - 1}{p-1}\).\n  4. **Case Analysis**:\n     - If \(p-1 \nmid k\), then \(\binom{p-1}{k} \equiv (-1)^k \pmod{p}\), and the sum simplifies to \((-1)^k \sum_{i=1}^{p-1} i^k \equiv 0 \pmod{p}\).\n     - If \(p-1 \mid k\), then \(\binom{p-1}{k} \equiv (-1)^k \pmod{p}\), and the sum simplifies to \((-1)^k \sum_{i=1}^{p-1} i^k \equiv -1 \pmod{p}\).\n  -/\n  constructor\n  · intro h\n    simp [Nat.ModEq, Nat.mod_eq_of_lt (Nat.lt_succ_self _)]\n    -- If \(p-1 \nmid k\), then the sum is congruent to 0 modulo \(p\).\n  · intro h\n    simp [Nat.ModEq, Nat.mod_eq_of_lt (Nat.lt_succ_self _)]\n    -- If \(p-1 \mid k\), then the sum is congruent to \(-1\) modulo \(p\).\n```",False

We can write $x^{4} = (Ax)^{2} + (8Bx)^{2}$. Therefore, $x^{4} \equiv 2(p)$ has a solution, namely $x = Ax$ and $y = 8Bx$.\n\n## Step 2: Showing that if $x^{4} \equiv 2(p)$ has a solution, then $p$ is of the form $A^{2}+64 B^{2}$.\n\nSuppose $x^{4} \equiv 2(p)$ has a solution. Then, there exist integers $x$ and $y$ such that $x^{4} + y^{4} = 2p$. We can write $x^{4} = (x^{2})^{2}$ and $y^{4} = (y^{2})^{2}$. Therefore, $(x^{2})^{2} + (y^{2})^{2} = 2p$. By Fermat's Two Squares Theorem, we know that $p$ can be expressed as the sum of two squares if and only if $p \equiv 1(4)$. Therefore, $p \equiv 1(4)$.\n\nNow, we can write $p = a^{2} + b^{2}$ for some integers $a$ and $b$. We can also write $a = 2A$ and $b = 2B$ for some integers $A$ and $B$. Therefore, $p = 4A^{2} + 4B^{2} = 4(A^{2} + B^{2})$. Since $p \equiv 1(4)$, we know that $A^{2} + B^{2}$ is not divisible by $4$. Therefore, $A^{2} + B^{2} = A^{2} + 64B^{2}$ for some integer $B$.

If \( x^4 \equiv 2 \pmod{p} \) has a solution, then \( p \) is of the form \( A^2 + 64B^2 \).\n  **Step 1: Showing that if \( p \) is of the form \( A^2 + 64B^2 \), then \( x^4 \equiv 2 \pmod{p} \) has a solution.**\n  Let \( p = A^2 + 64B^2 \). We can write \( x^4 = (Ax)^2 + (8Bx)^2 \). Therefore, \( x^4 \equiv 2 \pmod{p} \) has a solution, namely \( x = Ax \) and \( y = 8Bx \).\n  **Step 2: Showing that if \( x^4 \equiv 2 \pmod{p} \) has a solution, then \( p \) is of the form \( A^2 + 64B^2 \).**\n  Suppose \( x^4 \equiv 2 \pmod{p} \) has a solution. Then, there exist integers \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( x^4 + y^4 = 2p \). We can write \( x^4 = (x^2)^2 \) and \( y^4 = (y^2)^2 \). Therefore, \( (x^2)^2 + (y^2)^2 = 2p \). By Fermat's Two Squares Theorem, we know that \( p \) can be expressed as the sum of two squares if and only if \( p \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \). Therefore, \( p \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \).\n  Now, we can write \( p = a^2 + b^2 \) for some integers \( a \) and \( b \). We can also write \( a = 2A \) and \( b = 2B \) for some integers \( A \) and \( B \). Therefore, \( p = 4A^2 + 4B^2 = 4(A^2 + B^2) \). Since \( p \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \), we know that \( A^2 + B^2 \) is not divisible by 4. Therefore, \( A^2 + B^2 = A^2 + 64B^2 \) for some integer \( B \). Therefore, \( p = A^2 + 64B^2 \).\n  **Step 3: Combining the results**\n  We have shown that if \( p \) is of the form \( A^2 + 64B^2 \), then \( x^4 \equiv 2 \pmod{p} \) has a solution, and if \( x^4 \equiv 2 \pmod{p} \) has a solution, then \( p \) is of the form \( A^2 + 64B^2 \).

Therefore, this case is not possible.\n\n## Conclusion:\n\nSince both cases are not possible, we must have that $p$ divides neither $x^{2} - \sqrt{2}$ nor $x^{2} + \sqrt{2}$. Now, we can write $x^{4} - 2 = (x^{2} - \sqrt{2})(x^{2} + \sqrt{2})$.

We are given that $f$ is an infinitely differentiable function, which means that $f$ has derivatives of all orders.\n\nSince $f$ is infinitely differentiable, we can consider the behavior of its derivatives as we take higher and higher orders. We are also given that $f(0) = 0$ and $f(1) = 1$, which gives us some information about the behavior of $f$ at these two points.\n\nWe are also given that $f(x) \geq 0$ for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$. This means that the graph of $f$ lies above or on the $x$-axis for all $x$.\n\nNow, let's consider the behavior of the derivatives of $f$. We know that the first derivative of $f$ is $f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}$. Since $f(x) \geq 0$ for all $x$, we know that $f'(x) \geq 0$ for all $x$.\n\nSimilarly, we can consider the second derivative of $f$, which is $f''(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f'(x + h) - f'(x)}{h}$. Since $f'(x) \geq 0$ for all $x$, we know that $f''(x) \geq 0$ for all $x$.\n\nWe can continue this process, considering higher and higher derivatives of $f$. At each step, we will find that the derivative is non-negative.\n\nHowever, we are looking for a derivative that is negative. This means that we need to find a point where the derivative changes sign. Since the derivatives are non-negative at all points, we need to find a point where the derivative is zero.\n\nLet's consider the function $g(x) = f(x) - x^2$. We know that $g(0) = f(0) - 0^2 = 0$ and $g(1) = f(1) - 1^2 = 0$. This means that $g(x)$ has zeros at $x = 0$ and $x = 1$.\n\nSince $g(x)$ has zeros at $x = 0$ and $x = 1$, we know that $g'(x)$ has zeros at $x = 0$ and $x = 1$. Let's consider the behavior of $g'(x)$ between these two points.\n\nSince $g(x)$ is a polynomial, we know that $g'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree one less than $g(x)$. This means that $g'(x)$ is a linear function.\n\nSince $g'(x)$ is a linear function, we know that it has a constant slope. Let's call this slope $m$. We know that $g'(0) = g'(1) = 0$, which means that the slope $m$ is zero.\n\nHowever, this is a contradiction, since we know that $g'(x)$ is a linear function and therefore cannot have a slope of zero. This means that our assumption that $g'(x)$ has zeros at $x = 0$ and $x = 1$ must be false.\n\nThis means that $g'(x)$ does not have zeros at $x = 0$ and $x = 1$. Instead, it must have a zero at some point $x = c$ between $x = 0$ and $x = 1$.\n\nSince $g'(x)$ has a zero at $x = c$, we know that $g''(x)$ has a zero at $x = c$. Let's consider the behavior of $g''(x)$ around this point.\n\nSince $g''(x)$ has a zero at $x = c$, we know that $g''(x)$ changes sign at this point. This means that $g''(x)$ is negative for some values of $x$ and positive for other values of $x$.\n\nSince $g''(x)$ is negative for some values of $x$, we know that $g^{(3)}(x)$ is positive for some values of $x$.

A function $f$ is said to be in the class $C^n$ if it is $n$ times continuously differentiable. In other words, the function and all its derivatives up to the $n$th derivative are continuous.\n\nWe are given that the function $f$ is infinitely differentiable, which means it is in the class $C^\infty$. This implies that all its derivatives are continuous.\n\nNow, let's consider the given conditions: $f(0) = 0$, $f(1) = 1$, and $f(x) \geq 0$ for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$. These conditions suggest that the function $f$ is non-negative and has a minimum value of $0$ at $x = 0$.\n\nSince the function is infinitely differentiable, we can take its derivatives repeatedly. Let's consider the $n$th derivative of the function, denoted as $f^{(n)}(x)$.\n\nWe know that the $n$th derivative of the function is given by:\n\n$f^{(n)}(x) = \begin{cases} 0 & : x < 0 \\ (n + 1)^{\underline n} x & : x \geq 0 \end{cases}$\n\nwhere $(n + 1)^{\underline n}$ denotes the $n$th falling factorial of $n + 1$.\n\nNow, let's consider the case when $x = 0$. In this case, the $n$th derivative of the function is $0$, which is non-negative.\n\nHowever, we are looking for a case where the $n$th derivative of the function is less than $0$. This suggests that we need to find a value of $x$ such that the $n$th derivative of the function is negative.\n\nLet's consider the case when $x > 0$. In this case, the $n$th derivative of the function is given by $(n + 1)^{\underline n} x$. Since $x > 0$, we can choose a value of $x$ such that $(n + 1)^{\underline n} x < 0$.\n\nHowever, this is not possible since the falling factorial $(n + 1)^{\underline n}$ is always non-negative.\n\nThis suggests that we need to consider a different approach.

However, in this case, we are dealing with a square root, and we want to show that it is not an integer for some value of $n$.\n\nLet's consider the equation $a^3 + b^3 = c^3$ and its relationship to the given expression. We can rewrite the equation as $(a+b)(a^2-ab+b^2) = c^3$. This suggests that if $a+b$ and $a^2-ab+b^2$ are both perfect cubes, then $c$ must also be a perfect cube.\n\nNow, let's examine the expression $\sqrt{n^3+a n^2+b n+c}$. We can rewrite this expression as $\sqrt{(n+a)(n^2-an+b n+c)}$. Notice that if $n+a$ and $n^2-an+b n+c$ are both perfect squares, then the expression under the square root will be a perfect square, and therefore an integer.\n\nHowever, if we assume that $n+a$ and $n^2-an+b n+c$ are both perfect squares, then we can use the fact that $a^3 + b^3 = c^3$ has no solutions in strictly positive integers to show that there exists a positive integer $n$ such that the expression under the square root is not a perfect square.\n\nTo see this, suppose that $n+a$ and $n^2-an+b n+c$ are both perfect squares. Then, we can write $n+a = m^2$ and $n^2-an+b n+c = k^2$ for some integers $m$ and $k$. Substituting these expressions into the equation $a^3 + b^3 = c^3$, we get $m^6 + k^6 = (m^2-k^2)^3$.\n\nHowever, this equation has no solutions in strictly positive integers, since it is a special case of Fermat's Last Theorem. Therefore, our assumption that $n+a$ and $n^2-an+b n+c$ are both perfect squares must be false.\n\nThis means that there exists a positive integer $n$ such that the expression under the square root is not a perfect square, and therefore not an integer.

",1,1,"51174,3339,51175,3602","# Informal Proof:\n\nTo tackle this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the given Diophantine equation and the concept of Fermat's Last Theorem. The equation in question is $\sqrt{n^3+a n^2+b n+c}$, and we want to show that for any integers $a, b, c$, there exists a positive integer $n$ such that this expression is not an integer.\n\nLet's start by considering the special case of the equation when $a = b = c = 0$. In this case, the equation simplifies to $\sqrt{n^3}$, which is clearly not an integer for any positive integer $n$ that is not a perfect cube.\n\nNow, let's consider the general case where $a, b, c$ are arbitrary integers. We can rewrite the equation as $\sqrt{n^3+a n^2+b n+c} = \sqrt{(n^2+a n+b)^2+c}$. Our goal is to show that there exists a positive integer $n$ such that this expression is not an integer.\n\nWe can use a similar approach to the one used in the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. Specifically, we can use the fact that if $a^n + b^n = c^n$ has a solution in integers, then $c$ must be a multiple of $a$ or $b$. We can apply a similar argument to our equation.\n\nAssume, for the sake of contradiction, that the equation $\sqrt{n^3+a n^2+b n+c}$ has a solution in integers for all positive integers $n$. Then, we can write $\sqrt{n^3+a n^2+b n+c} = m$ for some integer $m$.\n\nNow, consider the equation $(n^2+a n+b)^2+c = m^2$. This equation has a solution in integers, and we can apply the same argument as before to conclude that $m$ must be a multiple of $n^2+a n+b$ or $c$.\n\nHowever, this leads to a contradiction. If $m$ is a multiple of $n^2+a n+b$, then $m^2$ is a multiple of $(n^2+a n+b)^2$, which implies that $c$ is a multiple of $(n^2+a n+b)^2$. But this is impossible, since $c$ is an arbitrary integer.\n\nOn the other hand, if $m$ is a multiple of $c$, then $m^2$ is a multiple of $c^2$, which implies that $(n^2+a n+b)^2$ is a multiple of $c^2$. But this is also impossible, since $(n^2+a n+b)^2$ is an arbitrary integer.\n\nTherefore, our assumption that the equation $\sqrt{n^3+a n^2+b n+c}$ has a solution in integers for all positive integers $n$ must be false. This means that there exists a positive integer $n$ such that the expression is not an integer.\n\nIn fact, we can show that there exists a positive integer $n$ such that the expression is not an integer for any given values of $a, b, c$. This is because the expression is a polynomial in $n$, and polynomials are dense in the set of real numbers. Therefore, for any given values of $a, b, c$, there exists a positive integer $n$ such that the expression is not an integer.\n\nThis completes our informal proof.","```lean4\nimport Mathlib\n\nopen scoped BigOperators\n\ntheorem exercise_1998_b6 (a b c : ℤ) :\n  ∃ n : ℤ, n > 0 ∧ ¬ ∃ m : ℤ, Real.sqrt (n^3 + a*n^2 + b*n + c) = m :=\n  by\n  use 1\n  constructor\n  norm_num\n  intro h\n  obtain ⟨m, hm⟩ := h\n  norm_num at hm\n  have : (1 : ℝ) = m := by\n    rw [← hm]\n    ring\n  norm_num at this\n  norm_num at hm\n  linarith\n```",False

We can see that it involves a square root, which means that the expression inside the square root must be a perfect square for the entire expression to be an integer.\n\nNow, let's consider the equation $a^3 + b^3 = c^3$, which is a special case of Fermat's Last Theorem. This theorem states that there are no solutions in strictly positive integers for the equation $a^3 + b^3 = c^3$. This implies that for any given values of $a$ and $b$, there is no corresponding value of $c$ that would make the equation true.\n\nWe can use this information to our advantage by considering the expression $n^3+a n^2+b n+c$. If we can show that this expression is not a perfect square for some value of $n$, then we can conclude that $\sqrt{n^3+a n^2+b n+c}$ is not an integer.\n\nOne way to approach this is to consider the properties of perfect squares. A perfect square is always non-negative, and it can be expressed as the square of an integer. In other words, if $x$ is an integer, then $x^2$ is a perfect square.\n\nNow, let's consider the expression $n^3+a n^2+b n+c$. If this expression is a perfect square, then it must be non-negative. However, if we can show that the expression is negative for some value of $n$, then we can conclude that it is not a perfect square.\n\nTo do this, we can use the fact that the expression $n^3+a n^2+b n+c$ is a cubic polynomial in $n$. A cubic polynomial can have at most three real roots, and if we can show that the expression is negative for some value of $n$, then we can conclude that it is not a perfect square.\n\nOne way to approach this is to consider the properties of the cubic polynomial $n^3+a n^2+b n+c$. If we can show that the polynomial has a negative value for some value of $n$, then we can conclude that the expression is not a perfect square.\n\nTo do this, we can use the fact that the polynomial $n^3+a n^2+b n+c$ has a leading coefficient of 1. This means that the polynomial is monotonically increasing for large values of $n$. In other words, if we increase the value of $n$ by 1, the value of the polynomial will also increase by 1.\n\nNow, let's consider the properties of the polynomial $n^3+a n^2+b n+c$ for small values of $n$. If we can show that the polynomial is negative for some small value of $n$, then we can conclude that the expression is not a perfect square.\n\nTo do this, we can use the fact that the polynomial $n^3+a n^2+b n+c$ has a constant term of $c$. This means that the polynomial will have a value of $c$ when $n=0$. If we can show that the value of the polynomial is negative when $n=0$, then we can conclude that the expression is not a perfect square.\n\nIn fact, we can show that the value of the polynomial is negative when $n=0$ by considering the properties of the equation $a^3 + b^3 = c^3$. This equation states that there are no solutions in strictly positive integers for the equation $a^3 + b^3 = c^3$. This implies that for any given values of $a$ and $b$, there is no corresponding value of $c$ that would make the equation true.\n\nIn particular, if we consider the case where $a=1$ and $b=1$, then we have $a^3 + b^3 = 2$. However, there is no value of $c$ that would make the equation $a^3 + b^3 = c^3$ true. This implies that the value of the polynomial $n^3+a n^2+b n+c$ is negative when $n=0$.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the expression $\sqrt{n^3+a n^2+b n+c}$ is not an integer for some value of $n$.
