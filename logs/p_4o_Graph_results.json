        "informal_proof": "# Informal Proof:\n\nTo prove that a holomorphic function \\( f \\) with a constant imaginary part is itself constant, let's break down the problem using the properties of holomorphic functions and the Cauchy-Riemann equations.\n\nFirst, recall that a holomorphic function \\( f \\) on an open set \\(\\Omega\\) in the complex plane can be expressed in terms of its real and imaginary parts. Specifically, if \\( f(z) = f(x + iy) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y) \\), where \\( u \\) and \\( v \\) are real-valued functions, then \\( f \\) is holomorphic if and only if \\( u \\) and \\( v \\) satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations:\n\n1. \\(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y}\\)\n2. \\(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = -\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x}\\)\n\nNow, according to the problem, the imaginary part of \\( f \\), which is \\( v(x, y) \\), is constant. Let's denote this constant by \\( c \\). This means that for all \\( (x, y) \\) in \\(\\Omega\\), \\( v(x, y) = c \\).\n\nSince \\( v \\) is constant, its partial derivatives with respect to both \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are zero:\n\n- \\(\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} = 0\\)\n- \\(\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} = 0\\)\n\nSubstituting these into the Cauchy-Riemann equations, we get:\n\n- \\(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = 0\\)\n- \\(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = 0\\)\n\nThese equations imply that the partial derivatives of \\( u \\) with respect to both \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are zero. In other words, \\( u \\) does not change as \\( x \\) or \\( y \\) changes, meaning \\( u \\) is also a constant function. Let's denote this constant by \\( k \\).\n\nTherefore, the function \\( f \\) can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ f(x + iy) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y) = k + ic \\]\n\nSince both \\( u \\) and \\( v \\) are constants, \\( f \\) is constant throughout the open set \\(\\Omega\\).\n\nIn conclusion, if the imaginary part of a holomorphic function is constant, the function itself must be constant. This is because the conditions imposed by the Cauchy-Riemann equations, combined with the constancy of the imaginary part, force the real part to be constant as well, resulting in the entire function being constant.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unexpected token '\u2202'; expected term\nunsolved goals\ncase h4\nf : \u2102 \u2192 \u2102\n\u03a9 : Set \u2102\na b : \u2191\u03a9\nh : IsOpen \u03a9\nhf : DifferentiableOn \u2102 f \u03a9\nhc\u271d : \u2203 c, \u2200 z \u2208 \u03a9, (f z).im = c\nc : \u211d\nhc h1 : \u2200 z \u2208 \u03a9, (f z).im = c\nz : \u2102\nhz : z \u2208 \u03a9\nh3 : DifferentiableAt \u2102 f z\n\u22a2 sorryAx (Sort ?u.1553) true\n\nf : \u2102 \u2192 \u2102\n\u03a9 : Set \u2102\na b : \u2191\u03a9\nh : IsOpen \u03a9\nhf : DifferentiableOn \u2102 f \u03a9\nhc\u271d : \u2203 c, \u2200 z \u2208 \u03a9, (f z).im = c\nc : \u211d\nhc h1 : \u2200 z \u2208 \u03a9, (f z).im = c\nz : \u2102\nhz : z \u2208 \u03a9\nh3 : DifferentiableAt \u2102 f z\nh4 : sorryAx (Sort ?u.1553) true\n\u22a2 (f z).re = (f \u2191a).re\nPlease revise the proof.",

The unit circle in the complex plane is defined by all complex numbers $z$ such that $|z| = 1$.\n\nFirst, let's recall what it means for a series to converge. A series $\\sum a_n$ converges if the sequence of its partial sums $S_N = a_1 + a_2 + \\cdots + a_N$ approaches a finite limit as $N$ goes to infinity. For the series $\\sum nz^n$, the $n$-th term is $a_n = nz^n$.\n\nNow, consider the modulus of each term in the series when $|z| = 1$. We have $|nz^n| = n|z^n| = n|z|^n = n \\cdot 1^n = n$. This means that the terms of the series do not tend to zero as $n$ increases; in fact, they grow linearly with $n$. \n\nAccording to the theorem \"Terms in Convergent Series Converge to Zero,\" if a series converges, then the terms of the series must approach zero. Since $|nz^n| = n$ does not approach zero as $n$ increases, the series cannot converge.\n\nFurthermore, let's consider the partial sums of the series. The $N$-th partial sum is $S_N = \\sum_{n=1}^N nz^n$. If we try to compute this sum, we notice that it involves terms like $z, 2z^2, 3z^3, \\ldots, Nz^N$. The magnitude of these terms increases with $n$, and since $|z| = 1$, the oscillatory nature of $z^n$ on the unit circle does not help in canceling out these terms to approach a finite limit. Instead, the partial sums tend to grow without bound as $N$ increases.\n\nTherefore, the series $\\sum nz^n$ does not converge for any $z$ on the unit circle, as the terms do not approach zero and the partial sums do not approach a finite limit. This completes the informal proof that the power series $\\sum nz^n$ does not converge on any point of the unit circle.",

This is a form of the Dirichlet series, which is known to converge for $\\theta \\neq 0$.\n\n   The key idea here is that the terms $e^{in\\theta}$ oscillate as $n$ increases, and this oscillation helps the series to converge. Specifically, the terms do not add up in a way that leads to divergence, unlike the harmonic series at $z = 1$.\n\n   More formally, the convergence of such series can be shown using the Dirichlet test for convergence, which states that if the partial sums of $e^{in\\theta}$ are bounded and $\\frac{1}{n}$ is a decreasing sequence tending to zero, then the series converges.\n\n   Since $e^{in\\theta}$ is periodic and its partial sums are bounded, and $\\frac{1}{n}$ is indeed a decreasing sequence tending to zero, the series converges for all $\\theta \\neq 0$.\n\nIn conclusion, the series $\\sum \\frac{z^n}{n}$ converges for all $z$ on the unit circle except at $z = 1$, where it diverges due to the nature of the harmonic series.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

This integral is a classic example in calculus and is often used to demonstrate techniques involving improper integrals and convergence.\n\nFirst, let's understand the structure of the integral. The function \\(\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\) is known to be an oscillating function that decays as \\(x\\) increases. This decay is crucial because it ensures that the integral converges, even though the sine function itself oscillates indefinitely.\n\nOne approach to evaluate this integral is to use a substitution method. We can substitute \\(t = px\\), where \\(p\\) is a positive constant. This transforms the integral into a form that is easier to handle:\n\n\\[\n\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\sin px}{x} \\, dx = \\frac{1}{p} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\sin t}{t} \\, dt\n\\]\n\nThe integral \\(\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\sin t}{t} \\, dt\\) is the Dirichlet Integral, which is known to equal \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\). Therefore, for any positive \\(p\\), the original integral evaluates to:\n\n\\[\n\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\sin px}{x} \\, dx = \\frac{\\pi}{2p}\n\\]\n\nSetting \\(p = 1\\), we find:\n\n\\[\n\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\sin x}{x} \\, dx = \\frac{\\pi}{2}\n\\]\n\nThis result can also be understood by considering the symmetry and properties of the sine function. The sine function is odd, meaning \\(\\sin(-x) = -\\sin(x)\\), which helps in evaluating integrals over symmetric intervals. Additionally, the decay of \\(\\frac{1}{x}\\) ensures that the integral converges as \\(x\\) approaches infinity.\n\nIn summary, by recognizing the integral as the Dirichlet Integral and using substitution, we can conclude that:\n\n\\[\n\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\sin x}{x} \\, dx = \\frac{\\pi}{2}\n\\]\n\nThis result is a beautiful example of how oscillatory functions can be integrated over infinite intervals to yield finite results, thanks to their decay properties.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'tendsto_nhds_of_metric'\nPlease revise the proof.",

An entire function can be expressed as a power series around any point \\( z_0 \\in \\mathbb{C} \\), specifically \\( f(z) = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty c_n (z - z_0)^n \\).\n\nThe key condition here is that for each \\( z_0 \\in \\mathbb{C} \\), at least one coefficient \\( c_n \\) in this expansion is zero. Let's explore what this means.\n\n1. **Understanding the Condition**: For any point \\( z_0 \\), the power series expansion of \\( f \\) around \\( z_0 \\) has at least one zero coefficient. This implies that the function cannot have a non-zero power series expansion with all coefficients non-zero at any point in the complex plane.\n\n2. **Implication for Entire Functions**: If \\( f \\) were not a polynomial, it would have an infinite number of non-zero coefficients in its power series expansion around some point. However, the condition that at least one coefficient is zero for every \\( z_0 \\) suggests that the series cannot be infinite with all non-zero terms.\n\n3. **Conclusion from the Condition**: The only way for an entire function to satisfy the condition that at least one coefficient is zero in every power series expansion is if the function is actually a polynomial. This is because a polynomial has a finite number of non-zero coefficients, and beyond a certain degree, all coefficients are zero. Thus, for a polynomial, it is trivially true that there is a zero coefficient in its power series expansion around any point.\n\n4. **Contradiction for Non-Polynomials**: If \\( f \\) were not a polynomial, it would have an infinite number of non-zero coefficients in its power series expansion around some point, contradicting the given condition.

This method is particularly useful for integrals over the entire real line involving functions that can be extended to the complex plane.\n\n1. **Complex Function and Contour Choice**: \n   Consider the complex function \\( f(z) = \\frac{z e^{iz}}{z^2 + a^2} \\), where \\( z \\) is a complex number. The integral of interest can be related to the real part of the integral of \\( f(z) \\) over the real line. We will evaluate this integral using a semicircular contour in the upper half of the complex plane, which is a common technique for integrals involving sine or cosine.\n\n2. **Residues and Poles**:\n   The function \\( f(z) \\) has poles at \\( z = ai \\) and \\( z = -ai \\). However, only the pole at \\( z = ai \\) lies in the upper half-plane, which is relevant for our contour. The residue at this pole can be calculated using the residue theorem.

According to the context provided, an entire function can be expressed as a power series that converges everywhere in the complex plane. This means that any entire function \\( f(z) \\) can be written as:\n\n\\[\nf(z) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n z^n\n\\]\n\nwhere the series converges for all \\( z \\in \\mathbb{C} \\).\n\nNow, let's consider the condition of injectivity. A function is injective (or one-to-one) if it never maps distinct inputs to the same output. For complex functions, injectivity imposes strong restrictions. In particular, if an entire function is injective, it cannot have any critical points (points where the derivative is zero) except possibly at infinity. This is because if \\( f'(z_0) = 0 \\) for some \\( z_0 \\), then by the open mapping theorem, \\( f \\) would map a neighborhood of \\( z_0 \\) to a neighborhood of \\( f(z_0) \\), contradicting injectivity.\n\nThe only entire functions that are injective are linear functions. To see why, consider the form of the power series for \\( f(z) \\). If \\( f(z) \\) were not linear, it would have terms of degree 2 or higher, such as \\( a_2 z^2 \\). However, such terms would imply the existence of critical points, as the derivative \\( f'(z) \\) would be zero at some points, violating injectivity.\n\nTherefore, the only way for \\( f(z) \\) to be entire and injective is for it to be a linear function, which has the form:\n\n\\[\nf(z) = az + b\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( a \\neq 0 \\) to ensure that the function is not constant (a constant function is not injective unless it is trivial, which is not allowed here since \\( a \\neq 0 \\)).\n\nIn conclusion, the requirement that an entire function be injective forces it to be a linear function of the form \\( f(z) = az + b \\), with \\( a, b \\in \\mathbb{C} \\) and \\( a \\neq 0 \\).

This is a consequence of the Weierstrass factorization theorem, which allows us to write \\( f(z) \\) as a product involving its zeros. Specifically, for a bounded holomorphic function in the unit disc, we can use the Blaschke product representation.\n\nA Blaschke product is a special type of infinite product that converges to a bounded holomorphic function in the unit disc.

The modulus \\( |z| \\) of a complex number \\( z \\) is the distance from the origin to the point representing \\( z \\) in the complex plane. The inequality we want to prove is a generalization of the triangle inequality, which states that the direct path (the modulus of the sum) is always less than or equal to the sum of the individual paths (the sum of the moduli).\n\n### Base Case:\nFor the base case, consider \\( n = 1 \\).

Disjoint sets have no elements in common, so \\( A \\cap B = \\emptyset \\). Closed sets in a metric space are those that contain all their limit points, meaning if a sequence of points from the set converges, its limit is also in the set.\n\nNow, consider the function \\( f: X \\to \\mathbb{R} \\) defined by \\( f(x) = d(x, B) \\), where \\( d(x, B) \\) is the distance from a point \\( x \\) to the set \\( B \\). This function measures how far each point in \\( X \\) is from the set \\( B \\).\n\nSince \\( B \\) is closed, the function \\( f \\) is continuous. This is because the distance function in a metric space is continuous, and the restriction of a continuous function to a closed set remains continuous.\n\nNext, because \\( A \\) is compact (a property that implies it is closed and bounded in a metric space), the continuous function \\( f \\) restricted to \\( A \\), denoted \\( f|_A \\), will attain its minimum value on \\( A \\). This is a key property of compact sets: continuous functions reach their extrema on compact sets.\n\nSince \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are disjoint, no point in \\( A \\) is actually in \\( B \\), so the distance from any point in \\( A \\) to \\( B \\) is not zero.

This means there exists a countable dense subset within the space. A dense subset is one where every point in the space is either in the subset or is a limit point of the subset. This property is crucial because it allows us to construct a countable base.\n\n2. **Constructing the Countable Base**: Using the countable dense subset, we can construct a countable base. Consider the dense subset \\( D = \\{d_1, d_2, d_3, \\ldots\\} \\). For each point \\( d_i \\) in this dense subset and each positive integer \\( n \\), consider the open ball \\( B(d_i, 1/n) \\), which is the set of all points within distance \\( 1/n \\) of \\( d_i \\).\n\n3. **Countability**: The collection of all such open balls \\( B(d_i, 1/n) \\) for all \\( i \\) and \\( n \\) is countable. This is because it is a countable union of countable sets: for each fixed \\( i \\), the set of open balls \\( \\{B(d_i, 1/n) : n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\} \\) is countable, and since \\( D \\) is countable, the union over all \\( i \\) is also countable.\n\n4. **Base Property**: This collection of open balls forms a base for the topology of the metric space. Any open set in the metric space can be expressed as a union of these open balls. This is because for any point in an open set, you can find a small enough open ball around it (due to the metric) that is contained within the open set, and since the dense subset is dense, you can find a point from the dense subset within this ball, ensuring that one of our constructed open balls is contained in the open set.\n\nThus, by leveraging the separability of compact metric spaces and constructing open balls around a countable dense subset, we have shown that every compact metric space has a countable base. This completes the informal proof.",

This means that open sets can be thought of as unions of open intervals.\n\nNow, consider any open set \\(U\\) in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). We want to express \\(U\\) as a union of disjoint open intervals. Here's how we can do it:\n\n1. **Identify Components**: For each point \\(x\\) in the open set \\(U\\), there is an open interval \\((a, b)\\) such that \\(x \\in (a, b) \\subseteq U\\). The collection of all such intervals forms a basis for the topology of \\(\\mathbb{R}\\).\n\n2. **Maximal Intervals**: For each point \\(x \\in U\\), consider the largest open interval \\((a_x, b_x)\\) that contains \\(x\\) and is entirely contained in \\(U\\). This interval is maximal in the sense that it cannot be extended further without including points outside of \\(U\\).\n\n3. **Disjoint Intervals**: The intervals \\((a_x, b_x)\\) for different points \\(x\\) in \\(U\\) may overlap, but we can refine this collection to a set of disjoint intervals. This is done by taking the union of overlapping intervals to form a single larger interval. The process of merging overlapping intervals ensures that the resulting collection of intervals is disjoint.\n\n4. **Countability**: Since \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) is a separable space (it has a countable dense subset, like the rational numbers), any open set in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) can be covered by a countable collection of open intervals. Therefore, the process of forming disjoint intervals from overlapping ones will also result in a countable collection. This is because each interval can be associated with a rational number within it, and there are only countably many rational numbers.\n\n5. **Union of Intervals**: Finally, the open set \\(U\\) can be expressed as the union of these disjoint open intervals. Each interval is open, and their union covers the entire set \\(U\\).\n\nIn summary, every open set in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) can be represented as a union of at most countable disjoint open intervals.

The limit of this sequence must lie in every \\( E_n \\) because each \\( E_n \\) is closed, and thus the limit is in the intersection \\( \\bigcap_{n=1}^{\\infty} E_n \\).\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   Since the diameter of the sets shrinks to zero, the intersection cannot contain more than one point. If it contained two distinct points, the diameter of the intersection would be at least the distance between these two points, contradicting the fact that the diameter approaches zero. Therefore, the intersection consists of exactly one point.\n\nIn summary, the nested nature of the sets, their closedness, and the condition on the diameter ensure that the intersection of all these sets is a single point. This point is the unique limit of any sequence of points chosen from these sets, demonstrating both existence and uniqueness.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

This condition tells us that as we approach any point $x$ from both the left and the right, the difference between the function values from these two directions becomes arbitrarily small. In simpler terms, the function does not have a \"jump\" discontinuity at any point because the left-hand and right-hand limits are equal.\n\nHowever, this condition alone does not guarantee that the function is continuous. Continuity at a point $x$ requires that the limit of $f(x + h)$ as $h$ approaches 0 from either side equals $f(x)$ itself. The given condition only ensures that the left-hand and right-hand limits are equal, but it does not say anything about these limits being equal to the actual function value at $x$.\n\nTo illustrate this, consider a function that is defined to be 0 for all rational numbers and 1 for all irrational numbers. This function, known as the Dirichlet function, satisfies the condition $\\lim_{h \\rightarrow 0} f(x + h) - f(x - h) = 0$ for every $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ because both the left-hand and right-hand limits are 0 (since the rationals are dense in the reals) and 1 (since the irrationals are also dense in the reals), respectively. However, the function is not continuous at any point because the value of the function at any point $x$ (whether rational or irrational) does not match the limit of the function as $h$ approaches 0.\n\nTherefore, the condition given in the problem is not sufficient to ensure continuity. It only ensures that the function does not have jump discontinuities, but it can still have other types of discontinuities, such as the one exhibited by the Dirichlet function. Thus, $f$ does not need to be continuous even if it satisfies the given condition.",

This function is continuous on its domain \\( E \\) because for any point \\( x_0 \\neq 0 \\), the function behaves nicely and does not have any jumps or breaks.\n\nHowever, the challenge arises when we try to extend this function to include \\( x = 0 \\) and make it continuous on the entire real line. The problem is that as \\( x \\) approaches 0 from either the positive or negative side, the values of \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{x} \\) become unbounded. Specifically, as \\( x \\to 0^+ \\), \\( f(x) \\to +\\infty \\), and as \\( x \\to 0^- \\), \\( f(x) \\to -\\infty \\). This behavior makes it impossible to define a single value \\( g(0) \\) that would make the function continuous at \\( x = 0 \\).\n\nTo be continuous at \\( x = 0 \\), the limit of \\( f(x) \\) as \\( x \\) approaches 0 from both sides must equal \\( g(0) \\).

Since \\( E \\) is bounded, there exists some real number \\( M \\) such that for all \\( x \\in E \\), the absolute value \\( |x| \\) is less than \\( M \\).

This means we can cover \\( E \\) with a finite number of intervals of length less than \\( \\delta \\). Let's say we can cover \\( E \\) with \\( n \\) such intervals, each of length less than \\( \\delta \\).\n\nChoose a point \\( x_i \\) from each of these intervals.

Although the problem at hand involves open mappings rather than injective ones, the underlying principles of continuity and the behavior of functions on intervals are still relevant.\n\nFirst, let's clarify what it means for a function to be a continuous open mapping. A function \\( f: \\mathbb{R}^1 \\to \\mathbb{R}^1 \\) is continuous if small changes in the input result in small changes in the output. It is an open mapping if it maps open sets to open sets. \n\nNow, consider the nature of a continuous function on a real interval. The Intermediate Value Theorem tells us that such a function cannot \"jump\" over any value between its outputs at two points. This property is crucial because it implies that the function must traverse all intermediate values, which is a key characteristic of monotonic functions.\n\nTo show that a continuous open mapping is monotonic, assume for contradiction that it is not. This would mean there exist points \\( x < y < z \\) such that the function does not preserve the order of their images, i.e., \\( f(x) \\leq f(y) \\) and \\( f(y) \\geq f(z) \\) without being strictly increasing or decreasing. However, this would contradict the function being open and continuous. \n\nIf \\( f \\) were not monotonic, there would be a point where the function \"reverses\" direction, creating a local maximum or minimum. At such a point, the function would not map an open interval to an open interval, as the image would include a closed point (the maximum or minimum), violating the open mapping property.\n\nMoreover, if \\( f \\) were not monotonic, the Intermediate Value Theorem would imply the existence of a point \\( c \\) between \\( x \\) and \\( z \\) where \\( f(c) = f(x) \\) or \\( f(c) = f(z) \\), contradicting the injectivity required for the function to be open (since open mappings on \\( \\mathbb{R}^1 \\) are injective over intervals).\n\nThus, by contradiction, a continuous open mapping on \\( \\mathbb{R}^1 \\) must be monotonic. This ensures that the function consistently increases or decreases, preserving the order of points in its domain and their images, aligning with the properties of continuous and open mappings.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

The problem gives us a condition: for all real numbers \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), the inequality \\( |f(x) - f(y)| \\leq (x - y)^2 \\) holds.\n\nLet's explore what this condition implies. The expression \\( (x - y)^2 \\) is always non-negative and equals zero if and only if \\( x = y \\). This means that the difference \\( |f(x) - f(y)| \\) is bounded by a value that becomes very small as \\( x \\) approaches \\( y \\).\n\nConsider what happens as \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) get closer together. If we let \\( y = x + h \\) where \\( h \\) is a small number, the condition becomes \\( |f(x) - f(x + h)| \\leq h^2 \\). As \\( h \\) approaches zero, \\( h^2 \\) also approaches zero. This implies that the difference \\( |f(x) - f(x + h)| \\) must also approach zero. \n\nIn other words, as \\( h \\) becomes very small, the values of \\( f(x) \\) and \\( f(x + h) \\) become arbitrarily close to each other.

Their derivatives, \\(f^{\\prime}(x)\\) and \\(g^{\\prime}(x)\\), exist, and importantly, \\(g^{\\prime}(x)\\) is not zero.

It states that if two functions are continuous on a closed interval and differentiable on the open interval, then there exists some point \\(\\xi\\) in the interval where the ratio of their derivatives equals the ratio of their differences over the interval.

A finite group \\( G \\) has a finite number of elements.

This is known as the commutator of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and it measures how much \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) fail to commute. If \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) commute, then \\(aba^{-1}b^{-1} = e\\).\n\nGiven the condition \\((ab)^n = a^n b^n\\), we can infer some properties about the group \\(G\\). This condition suggests that the group has some abelian-like properties, at least when raised to the power \\(n\\). In particular, it implies that the elements \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) commute when raised to the power \\(n\\).\n\nNow, let's consider the expression \\((aba^{-1}b^{-1})^{n(n-1)}\\). We want to show that this equals \\(e\\). Notice that if \\(aba^{-1}b^{-1} = e\\), then raising it to any power will still yield \\(e\\). However, we need to show this for the specific power \\(n(n-1)\\).\n\nThe key is to use the given condition \\((ab)^n = a^n b^n\\). This implies that the elements \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) behave as if they commute when raised to the power \\(n\\). Therefore, the commutator \\(aba^{-1}b^{-1}\\) should have a special property when raised to the power \\(n(n-1)\\).\n\nConsider the following reasoning: if \\((ab)^n = a^n b^n\\), then the \"error\" introduced by the non-commutativity of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is somehow \"neutralized\" when raised to the power \\(n\\). This suggests that the commutator \\(aba^{-1}b^{-1}\\) is in the center of the group when raised to the power \\(n\\), meaning it commutes with all elements of the group.\n\nNow, if we raise this commutator to the power \\(n(n-1)\\), we are essentially applying this neutralizing effect multiple times. Since \\(n(n-1)\\) is a multiple of \\(n\\), the repeated application of this effect results in the commutator becoming the identity element \\(e\\).\n\nTherefore, \\((aba^{-1}b^{-1})^{n(n-1)} = e\\), as required.

A proper subgroup of a group \\( G \\) is a subgroup that is not equal to \\( G \\) itself and is not the trivial subgroup containing only the identity element. If \\( G \\) has no proper subgroups, the only subgroups of \\( G \\) are \\( G \\) itself and the trivial subgroup.\n\nNow, let's consider the order of the group \\( G \\). By Lagrange's Theorem, the order of any subgroup of a finite group divides the order of the group. Since \\( G \\) has no proper subgroups, the only divisors of the order of \\( G \\) are 1 and the order of \\( G \\) itself. This implies that the order of \\( G \\) must be a prime number, say \\( p \\).\n\nNext, we use the theorem that states a group of prime order is cyclic. This theorem tells us that if a group \\( G \\) has order \\( p \\), where \\( p \\) is a prime number, then \\( G \\) is cyclic. A cyclic group is one that can be generated by a single element. In other words, there exists an element \\( a \\in G \\) such that every element of \\( G \\) can be expressed as a power of \\( a \\).\n\nTo see why this is true, consider any non-identity element \\( a \\) in \\( G \\). The order of \\( a \\) must divide the order of the group, which is \\( p \\). Since \\( p \\) is prime, the possible orders of \\( a \\) are 1 or \\( p \\). The order cannot be 1 because \\( a \\) is not the identity element. Therefore, the order of \\( a \\) is \\( p \\), meaning that \\( a \\) generates the entire group \\( G \\).\n\nThus, we conclude that if a group \\( G \\) has no proper subgroups, it must be cyclic and have order \\( p \\), where \\( p \\) is a prime number.

We know that \\( G \\) is an abelian group of order \\( p^n m \\), where \\( p \\) is a prime and \\( p \\nmid m \\).

This means that any group of order 9 is a group of order \\( p^2 \\) where \\( p = 3 \\). There is a well-known result in group theory that any group of order \\( p^2 \\) is abelian. Let's explore why this is the case.\n\nConsider a group \\( G \\) of order 9. By Lagrange's Theorem, the order of any subgroup of \\( G \\) must divide the order of \\( G \\). Therefore, the possible orders of subgroups of \\( G \\) are 1, 3, and 9. \n\n1. **Subgroup of Order 9**: If \\( G \\) itself is the only subgroup of order 9, then \\( G \\) is trivially abelian because it is the whole group.\n\n2. **Subgroup of Order 3**: If \\( G \\) has a subgroup of order 3, then by the properties of groups of prime order, this subgroup is cyclic and hence abelian. \n\nNow, consider the center of the group \\( Z(G) \\). The center of a group is the set of elements that commute with every element in the group. For any group \\( G \\), the center \\( Z(G) \\) is a subgroup of \\( G \\). By the class equation, the order of \\( G \\) is the sum of the order of the center and the sizes of the conjugacy classes that are not in the center. \n\nSince the order of \\( G \\) is 9, and 9 is a perfect square, it follows that the center \\( Z(G) \\) cannot be trivial (i.e., it cannot have order 1). If \\( Z(G) \\) were trivial, the remaining elements would have to form conjugacy classes whose sizes are divisors of 9, but this would contradict the structure of the group. Therefore, \\( Z(G) \\) must have order 3 or 9.\n\n- If \\( |Z(G)| = 9 \\), then \\( Z(G) = G \\), and \\( G \\) is abelian.\n- If \\( |Z(G)| = 3 \\), then \\( G/Z(G) \\) is a group of order 3, which is cyclic and hence abelian. \n\nIn both cases, the structure of the group forces it to be abelian. Therefore, any group of order 9 must be abelian. This conclusion aligns with the general result that groups of order \\( p^2 \\) are abelian, where \\( p \\) is a prime number. \n\nThus, we have shown that a group of order 9 must indeed be abelian.\nPrevious attempt failed with: expected ';' or line break\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

This is a basic property of homomorphisms: the image of a subgroup under a homomorphism is a subgroup.\n\n2. **Normality Condition**: To show \\( \\varphi(N) \\) is normal in \\( G' \\), we need to verify that for any \\( g' \\in G' \\) and any \\( n' \\in \\varphi(N) \\), the element \\( g'n'g'^{-1} \\) is also in \\( \\varphi(N) \\).\n\n3. **Using Surjectivity**: Since \\( \\varphi \\) is surjective, for any \\( g' \\in G' \\), there exists some \\( g \\in G \\) such that \\( \\varphi(g) = g' \\).\n\n4. **Element in Image**: For any \\( n' \\in \\varphi(N) \\), there exists some \\( n \\in N \\) such that \\( \\varphi(n) = n' \\).\n\n5. **Conjugation in \\( G' \\)**: Consider the element \\( g'n'g'^{-1} \\) in \\( G' \\). We can express this as \\( \\varphi(g) \\varphi(n) \\varphi(g)^{-1} \\).\n\n6. **Homomorphism Property**: Using the property of homomorphisms, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\varphi(gng^{-1}) = \\varphi(g)\\varphi(n)\\varphi(g)^{-1}\n   \\]\n\n7. **Normality in \\( G \\)**: Since \\( N \\) is normal in \\( G \\), \\( gng^{-1} \\in N \\). Therefore, \\( \\varphi(gng^{-1}) \\in \\varphi(N) \\).\n\n8. **Conclusion**: Thus, \\( \\varphi(g)\\varphi(n)\\varphi(g)^{-1} \\in \\varphi(N) \\), which means \\( g'n'g'^{-1} \\in \\varphi(N) \\).\n\nSince this holds for any \\( g' \\in G' \\) and any \\( n' \\in \\varphi(N) \\), we conclude that \\( \\varphi(N) \\) is normal in \\( G' \\).\n\nTherefore, the image of a normal subgroup under a homomorphism is also a normal subgroup in the image group.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  (Subgroup.map \u03c6 N).Normal\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nPlease revise the proof.",

By Sylow's theorems, we know that there are Sylow \\( p \\)-subgroups and Sylow \\( q \\)-subgroups in any group of this order. Specifically, the number of Sylow \\( p \\)-subgroups, denoted \\( n_p \\), must divide \\( q \\) and be congruent to 1 modulo \\( p \\). Similarly, the number of Sylow \\( q \\)-subgroups, \\( n_q \\), must divide \\( p \\) and be congruent to 1 modulo \\( q \\).\n\nGiven that \\( q \\mid p - 1 \\), we can deduce that there is a nontrivial homomorphism from a Sylow \\( q \\)-subgroup into the automorphism group of a Sylow \\( p \\)-subgroup. This is because the automorphism group of a cyclic group of order \\( p \\) is of order \\( p - 1 \\), and since \\( q \\mid p - 1 \\), there is a subgroup of order \\( q \\) in the automorphism group.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications of these Sylow subgroup counts. Since \\( n_p \\) divides \\( q \\) and is congruent to 1 modulo \\( p \\), the only possibility is \\( n_p = 1 \\) because \\( q < p \\). This means there is a unique Sylow \\( p \\)-subgroup, which is normal in the group. Similarly, \\( n_q \\) divides \\( p \\) and is congruent to 1 modulo \\( q \\), so \\( n_q = p \\) is the only possibility, indicating that there are \\( p \\) Sylow \\( q \\)-subgroups.\n\nThe existence of a normal Sylow \\( p \\)-subgroup and \\( p \\) Sylow \\( q \\)-subgroups suggests a semidirect product structure. The group can be expressed as a semidirect product of a normal Sylow \\( p \\)-subgroup by a Sylow \\( q \\)-subgroup. The action of the Sylow \\( q \\)-subgroup on the Sylow \\( p \\)-subgroup is determined by the nontrivial homomorphism mentioned earlier.\n\nSince the structure of the group is determined by this semidirect product, and the action is uniquely determined by the condition \\( q \\mid p - 1 \\), any two such groups must have the same structure. Therefore, they are isomorphic.\n\nIn conclusion, the condition \\( q \\mid p - 1 \\) ensures a unique way to construct a nonabelian group of order \\( pq \\) as a semidirect product, leading to the result that any two such groups are isomorphic.\nPrevious attempt failed with: \nPlease revise the proof.",

This means that the only element common to both \\( A \\) and \\( \\gen{b} \\) is the identity element \\( e \\).\n\n3. **Using the Properties of Prime Order**:\n   - Since \\( b \\) has order \\( p \\), the subgroup \\( \\gen{b} \\) consists of the elements \\( \\{e, b, b^2, \\ldots, b^{p-1}\\} \\).\n   - If there were any element \\( b^k \\) (where \\( 1 \\leq k < p \\)) in the intersection \\( A \\cap \\gen{b} \\), then \\( b^k \\) would have to be in both \\( A \\) and \\( \\gen{b} \\).\n\n4. **Contradiction Argument**:\n   - Suppose for contradiction that there exists some \\( b^k \\neq e \\) in \\( A \\cap \\gen{b} \\). Since \\( b^k \\in A \\) and \\( A \\) is normal, for any \\( g \\in G \\), \\( g b^k g^{-1} \\) must also be in \\( A \\).\n   - However, since \\( b \\not\\in A \\), and \\( b^k \\) is a power of \\( b \\), it follows that \\( b^k \\not\\in A \\) unless \\( b^k = e \\).\n   - This contradiction implies that no such \\( b^k \\neq e \\) can exist in \\( A \\cap \\gen{b} \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Therefore, the only element that can be in both \\( A \\) and \\( \\gen{b} \\) is the identity element \\( e \\).\n   - Hence, \\( A \\cap \\gen{b} = \\{e\\} \\), as required.\n\nThis reasoning shows that the intersection of the normal subgroup \\( A \\) and the cyclic subgroup generated by \\( b \\) is trivial, consisting only of the identity element.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "# Informal Proof:\n\nTo tackle this problem, we need to understand the relationship between a $p$-Sylow subgroup $P$ of a group $G$ and the automorphisms of $G$. The problem asks us to show that for every automorphism $\\varphi$ of $G$, the subgroup $P$ is invariant under $\\varphi$, meaning $\\varphi(P) = P$.\n\nFirst, let's recall some key concepts:\n\n1. **$p$-Sylow Subgroup**: A $p$-Sylow subgroup of a group $G$ is a maximal subgroup whose order is a power of a prime $p$. This means that $P$ is a subgroup of $G$ such that the order of $P$ is $p^n$ for some $n$, and $p^n$ is the highest power of $p$ dividing the order of $G$.\n\n2. **Normal Subgroup**: The notation $P \\triangleleft G$ indicates that $P$ is a normal subgroup of $G$. This means that for every element $g \\in G$, the conjugate $gPg^{-1}$ is equal to $P$.\n\n3. **Automorphism**: An automorphism of a group $G$ is a bijective homomorphism from $G$ to itself. Automorphisms preserve the group structure, meaning they map elements in a way that respects the group operation.\n\nNow, let's consider why $\\varphi(P) = P$ for every automorphism $\\varphi$ of $G$:\n\n- Since $P$ is a normal subgroup of $G$, it is invariant under conjugation by any element of $G$. This property is crucial because it implies a certain symmetry and stability of $P$ within $G$.\n\n- An automorphism $\\varphi$ of $G$ is a structure-preserving map. It respects the group operation and, importantly, the subgroup structure. Since $P$ is a $p$-Sylow subgroup and normal in $G$, it is characterized by its order and its normality.\n\n- The order of $P$ is a power of $p$, and since automorphisms preserve the order of elements and subgroups, $\\varphi(P)$ must also have order $p^n$. \n\n- Because $P$ is normal, any subgroup of the same order that is also normal must be $P$ itself. This is because normal subgroups of a given order are unique in a group.\n\n- Therefore, when $\\varphi$ acts on $P$, it must map $P$ to a subgroup of the same order and normality, which can only be $P$ itself. Thus, $\\varphi(P) = P$.\n\nIn summary, the normality of $P$ in $G$ and the properties of automorphisms ensure that $P$ is invariant under any automorphism of $G$. This is why for every automorphism $\\varphi$ of $G$, we have $\\varphi(P) = P$.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unexpected end of input\nPlease revise the proof.",

This means that for any element $i$ in the set being permuted, if $\\sigma$ moves $i$ (i.e., $\\sigma(i) \\neq i$), then $\\tau$ must leave $i$ fixed (i.e., $\\tau(i) = i$), and vice versa. In other words, $\\sigma$ and $\\tau$ are disjoint permutations.\n\nNow, consider the condition $\\sigma \\tau = e$. This means that for every element $i$, applying $\\tau$ and then $\\sigma$ results in $i$ itself, i.e., $\\sigma(\\tau(i)) = i$.\n\nLet's analyze what happens for an arbitrary element $i$:\n\n1. **Case 1: $\\tau(i) = i$.**  \n   If $\\tau$ leaves $i$ fixed, then $\\sigma(\\tau(i)) = \\sigma(i) = i$. This implies that $\\sigma$ also leaves $i$ fixed.\n\n2. **Case 2: $\\tau(i) \\neq i$.**  \n   If $\\tau$ moves $i$, then by the condition that $\\sigma$ and $\\tau$ disturb no common element, $\\sigma$ must leave $i$ fixed. Therefore, $\\sigma(i) = i$. However, since $\\sigma(\\tau(i)) = i$, and $\\sigma$ leaves $i$ fixed, it must be that $\\tau(i) = i$ to satisfy $\\sigma(\\tau(i)) = i$. This is a contradiction unless $\\tau(i) = i$.\n\nFrom both cases, we see that for any element $i$, both $\\sigma$ and $\\tau$ must leave $i$ fixed. Therefore, $\\sigma(i) = i$ and $\\tau(i) = i$ for all elements $i$ in the set.

The field $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ consists of two elements: 0 and 1. A $2 \\times 2$ matrix with entries in $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ can have a determinant of 0 or 1. We are interested in matrices with a non-zero determinant, which means the determinant must be 1. The determinant of a matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix}$ is given by $ad - bc$. In $\\mathbb{Z}_2$, subtraction is the same as addition, so the determinant is $ad + bc$. For the determinant to be 1, $ad + bc = 1$.\n\nNow, let's list the possible matrices in $T$. The identity matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$ is clearly in $T$. Other matrices include $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$, $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$, $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, and $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. Each of these matrices has a determinant of 1, and there are no other $2 \\times 2$ matrices over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ with this property.\n\nNext, consider $S_3$, the symmetric group on 3 letters. It consists of all permutations of the set $\\{1, 2, 3\\}$. There are 6 permutations: the identity permutation, two 2-cycles (transpositions), and three 3-cycles. The elements of $S_3$ can be represented as: the identity $(1)$, the transpositions $(12)$, $(13)$, and $(23)$, and the 3-cycles $(123)$ and $(132)$.\n\nTo establish an isomorphism, we need to map each element of $T$ to a unique element of $S_3$ such that the group operation (matrix multiplication in $T$ and permutation composition in $S_3$) is preserved. \n\nWe can construct the following mapping:\n- Map the identity matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$ to the identity permutation $(1)$.\n- Map $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ to the transposition $(12)$.\n- Map $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$ to the transposition $(13)$.\n- Map $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$ to the transposition $(23)$.\n- Map $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ to the 3-cycle $(123)$.\n- Map $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$ to the 3-cycle $(132)$.\n\nThis mapping is bijective, meaning each element of $T$ is paired with a unique element of $S_3$, and vice versa. Furthermore, the group operation is preserved because the product of any two matrices in $T$ corresponds to the composition of the corresponding permutations in $S_3$. \n\nThus, we have established an isomorphism between $T$ and $S_3$, showing that $T$ is isomorphic to the symmetric group on 3 letters.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  Mul S3\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nPlease revise the proof.",

Notice that the zero element of the ring, $0_R$, satisfies $0_R \\circ a = 0_R$ for any $a \\in R$. Therefore, $0_R \\in L(a)$, which means $L(a)$ is not empty.\n\n   Next, we need to show that $L(a)$ is closed under addition and taking negatives, which are the requirements for being a subgroup. Suppose $x, y \\in L(a)$. This means $x \\circ a = 0_R$ and $y \\circ a = 0_R$. We need to show that $(x + y) \\circ a = 0_R$. Using the distributive property of the ring, we have:\n\n   \\[\n   (x + y) \\circ a = (x \\circ a) + (y \\circ a) = 0_R + 0_R = 0_R\n   \\]\n\n   Thus, $x + y \\in L(a)$.\n\n   Now, consider the additive inverse of $x$, denoted $-x$. We need to show that $-x \\in L(a)$. Since $x \\circ a = 0_R$, we have:\n\n   \\[\n   (-x) \\circ a = -(x \\circ a) = -0_R = 0_R\n   \\]\n\n   Therefore, $-x \\in L(a)$. This shows that $L(a)$ is closed under addition and taking negatives, confirming that it is a subgroup of the additive group of $R$.\n\n2. **Absorption Property:**\n\n   We need to show that for any $r \\in R$ and $x \\in L(a)$, the product $r \\circ x$ is also in $L(a)$. Since $x \\in L(a)$, we have $x \\circ a = 0_R$. We need to show that $(r \\circ x) \\circ a = 0_R$. Using the associativity of multiplication in the ring, we have:\n\n   \\[\n   (r \\circ x) \\circ a = r \\circ (x \\circ a) = r \\circ 0_R = 0_R\n   \\]\n\n   This shows that $r \\circ x \\in L(a)$ for any $r \\in R$ and $x \\in L(a)$.\n\nSince $L(a)$ satisfies both the subgroup property and the absorption property, we conclude that $L(a)$ is indeed an ideal of the commutative ring $R$.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

A number \\( a \\) is a quadratic residue modulo \\( p \\) if there exists an integer \\( x \\) such that \\( x^2 \\equiv a \\pmod{p} \\). Otherwise, \\( a \\) is a quadratic non-residue.\n\nNow, consider the numbers \\( 1^2, 2^2, \\ldots, (p-1)^2 \\) modulo \\( p \\). These are all the possible squares of the integers from 1 to \\( p-1 \\). Notice that for any integer \\( r \\), \\( r^2 \\equiv (-r)^2 \\pmod{p} \\). This means that the squares form pairs: \\( r^2 \\) and \\( (p-r)^2 \\) are congruent modulo \\( p \\).\n\nSince \\( p \\) is an odd prime, the numbers \\( 1, 2, \\ldots, p-1 \\) can be divided into pairs \\( (r, p-r) \\). There are \\( (p-1)/2 \\) such pairs because there are \\( p-1 \\) numbers in total. Each pair contributes exactly one distinct quadratic residue because \\( r^2 \\equiv (p-r)^2 \\pmod{p} \\).\n\nTo ensure that these residues are distinct, assume \\( r^2 \\equiv s^2 \\pmod{p} \\) for some \\( 1 \\leq r, s \\leq (p-1)/2 \\). This implies \\( p \\mid (r^2 - s^2) = (r+s)(r-s) \\). Since \\( 1 \\leq r+s \\leq p-1 \\) and \\( 1 \\leq r-s \\leq p-1 \\), neither \\( r+s \\) nor \\( r-s \\) can be divisible by \\( p \\) unless \\( r = s \\). Thus, all residues \\( 1^2, 2^2, \\ldots, ((p-1)/2)^2 \\) are distinct modulo \\( p \\).\n\nTherefore, there are exactly \\( (p-1)/2 \\) distinct quadratic residues among the numbers \\( 1, 2, \\ldots, p-1 \\). Since there are \\( p-1 \\) numbers in total, the remaining \\( (p-1)/2 \\) numbers must be quadratic non-residues.\n\nIn conclusion, for an odd prime \\( p \\), exactly half of the numbers from 1 to \\( p-1 \\) are quadratic residues, and the other half are quadratic non-residues modulo \\( p \\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: \nPlease revise the proof.",

This means that in such a field, any integer multiple of \\(p\\) is equivalent to zero when considered as a sum of \\(1_F\\).\n\n2. **Binomial Theorem in Characteristic \\(p\\) Field**: Normally, the binomial theorem states that \\((a + b)^m = \\sum_{k=0}^{m} \\binom{m}{k} a^{m-k} b^k\\). However, in a field of characteristic \\(p\\), the binomial coefficients \\(\\binom{m}{k}\\) for \\(1 \\leq k \\leq m-1\\) are divisible by \\(p\\) when \\(m = p^n\\).

Therefore, each term in the binomial expansion where \\(1 \\leq k \\leq m-1\\) vanishes because \\(\\binom{m}{k}\\) is zero in the field.

This is why \\((a + b)^m = a^m + b^m\\) holds true for \\(m = p^n\\).\n\nThis proof relies on the unique properties of fields with non-zero characteristic and the behavior of binomial coefficients in such fields, which allows us to simplify the binomial expansion significantly.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

The degree of the algebraic number is the smallest degree of such a polynomial.\n\nIn this problem, we are given a polynomial \\( p(x) = x^5 + \\sqrt{2}x^3 + \\sqrt{5}x^2 + \\sqrt{7}x + \\sqrt{11} \\) and told that \\( a \\) is a root of this polynomial, i.e., \\( p(a) = 0 \\).\n\nThe coefficients of this polynomial are not in \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) because they include \\(\\sqrt{2}\\), \\(\\sqrt{5}\\), \\(\\sqrt{7}\\), and \\(\\sqrt{11}\\), which are irrational numbers. However, we can transform this polynomial into one with rational coefficients by eliminating the square roots.\n\nEach of these square roots can be expressed as a root of a polynomial with rational coefficients. For example, \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) is a root of \\( x^2 - 2 = 0 \\), \\(\\sqrt{5}\\) is a root of \\( x^2 - 5 = 0 \\), and so on. These are quadratic polynomials, each of degree 2.\n\nTo eliminate the square roots from the polynomial \\( p(x) \\), we can replace each square root with a new variable and then multiply the entire polynomial by appropriate powers of these variables to clear the square roots. This process involves considering the least common multiple of the degrees of the polynomials that define each square root.\n\nSince each square root is defined by a polynomial of degree 2, and there are four such square roots, the least common multiple of these degrees is \\( 2^4 = 16 \\). Therefore, we can construct a polynomial with rational coefficients by raising the entire polynomial to the 16th power, which will eliminate the square roots.\n\nHowever, the original polynomial \\( p(x) \\) is of degree 5. When we raise a polynomial of degree 5 to the 16th power, the resulting polynomial will have a degree of \\( 5 \\times 16 = 80 \\).\n\nThus, we can construct a polynomial with rational coefficients of degree at most 80 that has \\( a \\) as a root.

This characteristic property has significant implications for polynomial behavior in the field.\n\nThe polynomial \\(x^m - x\\) can be rewritten as \\(x^{p^n} - x\\). We want to find the roots of this polynomial and show that they are distinct. A root of this polynomial is any element \\(a \\in F\\) such that \\(a^{p^n} = a\\).\n\nNow, consider the Frobenius endomorphism, which is a map defined by \\(f(x) = x^p\\) in a field of characteristic \\(p\\). This map is particularly useful because it preserves the structure of the field and is an automorphism when applied repeatedly. Specifically, for any element \\(a\\) in the field, we have \\((a^p)^p = a^{p^2}\\), and so on, up to \\(a^{p^n}\\).\n\nThe key observation here is that in a field of characteristic \\(p\\), the map \\(x \\mapsto x^p\\) is injective. This means that if \\(a^p = b^p\\), then \\(a = b\\). By extension, the map \\(x \\mapsto x^{p^n}\\) is also injective, meaning that if \\(a^{p^n} = b^{p^n}\\), then \\(a = b\\).\n\nGiven this injectivity, if \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both roots of the polynomial \\(x^{p^n} - x\\), then \\(a^{p^n} = a\\) and \\(b^{p^n} = b\\). If \\(a \\neq b\\), then \\(a^{p^n} \\neq b^{p^n}\\) unless \\(a = b\\), which contradicts the assumption that \\(a \\neq b\\). Therefore, all roots must be distinct.\n\nThus, the roots of the polynomial \\(x^{p^n} - x\\) are precisely the elements of the field that satisfy \\(a^{p^n} = a\\), and due to the injectivity of the Frobenius map, these roots are distinct. This completes the proof that all the roots of \\(x^m - x\\) are distinct when \\(m = p^n\\) in a field of characteristic \\(p\\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

A set \\( U \\) is open if, for every point \\( x \\in U \\), there exists an open neighborhood around \\( x \\) that is entirely contained within \\( U \\). This means that \\( U \\) does not \"approach\" its boundary from the inside; it is entirely surrounded by points that are also in \\( U \\).\n\nNow, consider the complement of \\( U \\), denoted as \\( \\relcomp M U \\). A point \\( x \\) is a limit point of \\( \\relcomp M U \\) if every open set containing \\( x \\) also contains at least one point from \\( \\relcomp M U \\) other than \\( x \\) itself. In other words, \\( x \\) is \"close\" to points in \\( \\relcomp M U \\).\n\n### Forward Direction:\nAssume \\( U \\) is open. We need to show that no point in \\( U \\) is a limit point of \\( \\relcomp M U \\). Since \\( U \\) is open, for any point \\( x \\in U \\), there exists an open neighborhood \\( V \\) such that \\( V \\subseteq U \\). This implies that \\( V \\cap \\relcomp M U = \\emptyset \\), meaning there are no points of \\( \\relcomp M U \\) in \\( V \\). Therefore, \\( x \\) cannot be a limit point of \\( \\relcomp M U \\) because there is an open set around \\( x \\) that does not intersect \\( \\relcomp M U \\).\n\n### Reverse Direction:\nNow, assume that no point in \\( U \\) is a limit point of \\( \\relcomp M U \\). We need to show that \\( U \\) is open. For any point \\( x \\in U \\), since \\( x \\) is not a limit point of \\( \\relcomp M U \\), there exists an open set \\( V \\) containing \\( x \\) such that \\( V \\cap \\relcomp M U = \\emptyset \\). This means \\( V \\subseteq U \\), as \\( V \\) cannot contain any points from \\( \\relcomp M U \\). Hence, \\( U \\) is open because around every point \\( x \\in U \\), we can find an open neighborhood entirely contained within \\( U \\).\n\nIn summary, a set \\( U \\) is open if and only if none of its points are limit points of its complement. This is because being open ensures that each point in \\( U \\) has a \"buffer zone\" that does not touch the complement, and conversely, if no point in \\( U \\) is a limit point of the complement, it means \\( U \\) can be surrounded by open neighborhoods that do not intersect the complement, thus making \\( U \\) open.",

In many topologies, particularly the discrete topology, every subset is open by definition. This is because, in the discrete topology, the collection of open sets is precisely the power set of the space, meaning every possible subset is included as an open set. Therefore, if we are considering the discrete topology on \\(\\mathbb{N}\\), every subset \\(S\\) is trivially open.\n\nNext, we need to show that every subset \\(S\\) is closed. A set is closed if its complement is open. In the discrete topology, since every subset is open, the complement of any subset is also open. Therefore, the complement of \\(S\\), which is \\(\\mathbb{N} \\setminus S\\), is open. This means \\(S\\) is closed.\n\nThus, in the discrete topology on \\(\\mathbb{N}\\), every subset is both open and closed, or clopen.

In other words, \\(d(a_0, b_0)\\) is the minimum distance between the sets \\(A\\) and \\(B\\).\n\nFirst, let's recall that \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are compact subsets of a metric space \\(M\\). Compactness is a crucial property here because it implies that any continuous function defined on these sets will attain its minimum and maximum values. \n\nWe define a function \\(f: A \\times B \\to \\mathbb{R}\\) by \\(f(a, b) = d(a, b)\\), where \\(d\\) is the metric on \\(M\\). This function measures the distance between any point \\(a\\) in \\(A\\) and any point \\(b\\) in \\(B\\). \n\nSince \\(d\\) is a metric, it is continuous. Therefore, the function \\(f\\) is continuous on the product space \\(A \\times B\\). The product of two compact spaces is also compact, so \\(A \\times B\\) is compact.\n\nBy the extreme value theorem, which states that a continuous function on a compact space attains its minimum and maximum values, the function \\(f\\) must attain a minimum value on \\(A \\times B\\). This means there exist points \\(a_0 \\in A\\) and \\(b_0 \\in B\\) such that \\(f(a_0, b_0) = d(a_0, b_0)\\) is the minimum value of \\(f\\).\n\nThus, for all \\(a \\in A\\) and \\(b \\in B\\), we have \\(d(a_0, b_0) \\leq d(a, b)\\). This shows that \\(a_0\\) and \\(b_0\\) are the points in \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), respectively, that are closest to each other, satisfying the condition of the problem.\n\nIn summary, the compactness of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) ensures that the distance function \\(f\\) attains a minimum value, and the continuity of the metric guarantees that this minimum is indeed the smallest distance between any points in \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). Therefore, such points \\(a_0\\) and \\(b_0\\) exist.\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  dist p.1 p.2\nargument\n  p.2\nhas type\n  \u2191B : Type u_1\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u2191A : Type u_1\napplication type mismatch\n  IsCompact.prod hA hB hf\nargument\n  hf\nhas type\n  Continuous f : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  ?m.16502 \u2264 \ud835\udcdf (A \u00d7\u02e2 B) : Prop\napplication type mismatch\n  And.intro hp\u2080.left\nargument\n  hp\u2080.left\nhas type\n  (a\u2080, b\u2080) \u2208 A \u00d7\u02e2 B : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  a\u2080 \u2208 A : Prop\napplication type mismatch\n  And.intro hp\u2080.right\nargument\n  hp\u2080.right\nhas type\n  ClusterPt (a\u2080, b\u2080) ?m.16502 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  b\u2080 \u2208 B : Prop\ninvalid projection, structure expected\n  hp\u2080.right\nhas type\n  ClusterPt (a\u2080, b\u2080) ?m.16502\ninvalid projection, structure has only 1 field(s)\n  hp\u2080.right\nhas type\n  (\ud835\udcdd (a\u2080, b\u2080) \u2293 ?m.16502).NeBot\ntype mismatch\n  Continuous.comp continuous_dist (Continuous.prod_mk continuous_fst continuous_snd)\nhas type\n  Continuous ((fun p => dist p.1 p.2) \u2218 fun x => (x.1, x.2)) : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  Continuous f : Prop\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "# Informal Proof:\n\nTo prove that the intersection of a nested sequence of non-empty closed subsets of a compact space is non-empty, let's first understand the setup. We have a compact topological space \\( T \\) and a sequence of closed subsets \\( V_1, V_2, V_3, \\ldots \\) such that each subset is contained within the previous one, i.e., \\( V_{i+1} \\subseteq V_i \\) for all \\( i \\). Each \\( V_n \\) is non-empty.\n\nThe goal is to show that the intersection of all these sets, \\( \\bigcap_{n=1}^\\infty V_n \\), is not empty.\n\n1. **Compactness and Closed Sets**: Since \\( T \\) is compact and each \\( V_n \\) is a closed subset of \\( T \\), each \\( V_n \\) is also compact. This is a key property because compact sets have the finite intersection property: if a collection of compact sets has the property that every finite subcollection has a non-empty intersection, then the intersection of all the sets is also non-empty.\n\n2. **Assume for Contradiction**: Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that the intersection \\( \\bigcap_{n=1}^\\infty V_n \\) is empty. This means that for every point in \\( V_1 \\), there is some \\( V_n \\) that does not contain that point.\n\n3. **Open Cover Construction**: Consider the set \\( V_1 \\setminus V_n \\) for each \\( n \\). Since \\( V_n \\) is closed, \\( V_1 \\setminus V_n \\) is open in \\( V_1 \\). The collection \\( \\{ V_1 \\setminus V_n : n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\} \\) forms an open cover of \\( V_1 \\) because we assumed that every point in \\( V_1 \\) is excluded from some \\( V_n \\).\n\n4. **Finite Subcover**: Since \\( V_1 \\) is compact, there must be a finite subcover of this open cover. This means there exist finitely many indices \\( n_1, n_2, \\ldots, n_j \\) such that \\( V_1 = \\bigcup_{i=1}^j (V_1 \\setminus V_{n_i}) \\).\n\n5. **Contradiction**: Now, consider the intersection \\( \\bigcap_{i=1}^j V_{n_i} \\). By construction, this intersection is contained in each \\( V_{n_i} \\) and hence in \\( V_1 \\). However, the finite subcover implies that this intersection is empty, which contradicts the fact that each \\( V_{n_i} \\) is non-empty and nested (i.e., \\( V_{n_j} \\subseteq V_{n_k} \\) for \\( j > k \\)).\n\n6. **Conclusion**: The contradiction arises from the assumption that the intersection is empty. Therefore, the intersection \\( \\bigcap_{n=1}^\\infty V_n \\) must be non-empty.\n\nThis reasoning shows that in a compact space, the intersection of a nested sequence of non-empty closed sets is indeed non-empty.\nPrevious attempt failed with: type mismatch\n  hs\nhas type\n  \u2200 (i : \u2115), s i \u2283 s (i + 1) : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u2200 (i : \u2115), IsCompact (s i) : Prop\ntype mismatch\n  hs\nhas type\n  \u2200 (i : \u2115), s i \u2283 s (i + 1) : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u2200 (i : \u2115), (s i).Nonempty : Prop\ninvalid field notation, type is not of the form (C ...) where C is a constant\n  IsCompact\nhas type\n  Set ?m.1544 \u2192 Prop\nPlease revise the proof.",

This inequality tells us that the difference in the function values \\( f(t) \\) and \\( f(x) \\) is bounded by the square of the distance between \\( t \\) and \\( x \\). \n\nNow, let's explore what happens as \\( t \\) gets very close to \\( x \\). Specifically, consider the case where \\( t \\) approaches \\( x \\). As \\( t \\) gets closer to \\( x \\), the value of \\( |t - x| \\) becomes very small. Consequently, \\( |t - x|^2 \\) becomes even smaller because squaring a small number makes it even smaller.\n\nGiven the inequality \\( |f(t) - f(x)| \\leq |t - x|^2 \\), as \\( |t - x| \\) approaches zero, \\( |f(t) - f(x)| \\) must also approach zero. This means that the difference between \\( f(t) \\) and \\( f(x) \\) becomes negligible as \\( t \\) gets closer to \\( x \\).\n\nIn essence, for any two points \\( t \\) and \\( x \\) that are arbitrarily close, the values \\( f(t) \\) and \\( f(x) \\) must be nearly identical. This behavior is characteristic of a constant function, where the function value does not change regardless of the input.\n\nTo solidify this argument, consider any two points \\( x_1 \\) and \\( x_2 \\) in \\( \\mathbb{R} \\). We can choose a sequence of points \\( x_1 = x_0, x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n = x_2 \\) such that each pair \\( (x_i, x_{i+1}) \\) is very close together. By the inequality, \\( |f(x_{i+1}) - f(x_i)| \\leq |x_{i+1} - x_i|^2 \\), and as each \\( |x_{i+1} - x_i| \\) is small, each \\( |f(x_{i+1}) - f(x_i)| \\) is also small. Summing these small differences over the sequence from \\( x_1 \\) to \\( x_2 \\) shows that \\( |f(x_2) - f(x_1)| \\) is also small, and as the sequence can be made arbitrarily fine, \\( f(x_2) = f(x_1) \\).\n\nTherefore, \\( f \\) must be constant across its entire domain, as the function value does not change between any two points.

For any \\(\\epsilon > 0\\), since \\(\\mu(s) \\to 0\\) as \\(s \\to 0\\), there exists a \\(\\delta > 0\\) such that \\(\\mu(\\delta) < \\epsilon\\).

This satisfies the definition of uniform continuity, as the choice of \\(\\delta\\) works for all \\( s, t \\).\n\n2. **If a function is uniformly continuous, then it has a modulus of continuity:**\n\n   Suppose \\( f \\) is uniformly continuous. For each \\( n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\), let \\(\\epsilon = \\frac{1}{n}\\). By uniform continuity, there exists a \\(\\delta_n > 0\\) such that for all \\( s, t \\in [a, b] \\), if \\(|s - t| < \\delta_n\\), then \\(|f(s) - f(t)| < \\frac{1}{n}\\).

For any \\( s, t \\in [a, b] \\), \\(|f(s) - f(t)| \\leq \\mu(|s - t|)\\), showing that \\( f \\) has a modulus of continuity.\n\nThus, we have shown that a function is uniformly continuous if and only if it has a modulus of continuity.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

The center of a group, say $G$, is the set of elements in $G$ that commute with every element of $G$. In other words, if $Z(G)$ is the center of $G$, then for any element $z \\in Z(G)$ and any element $g \\in G$, we have $zg = gz$.\n\nNow, consider two groups $G$ and $H$. We want to show that the center of the direct product $G \\times H$ is the direct product of the centers of $G$ and $H$, i.e., $Z(G \\times H) = Z(G) \\times Z(H)$.\n\n1. **Show $Z(G) \\times Z(H) \\subseteq Z(G \\times H)$:**\n\n   Take any element $(z, w) \\in Z(G) \\times Z(H)$. This means $z \\in Z(G)$ and $w \\in Z(H)$. By definition, $z$ commutes with every element of $G$, and $w$ commutes with every element of $H$.\n\n   Now, consider any element $(g, h) \\in G \\times H$. We need to show that $(z, w)$ commutes with $(g, h)$ in $G \\times H$. The product in $G \\times H$ is defined component-wise, so:\n\n   \\[\n   (z, w)(g, h) = (zg, wh)\n   \\]\n\n   Since $z \\in Z(G)$, we have $zg = gz$. Similarly, since $w \\in Z(H)$, we have $wh = hw$. Therefore:\n\n   \\[\n   (zg, wh) = (gz, hw) = (g, h)(z, w)\n   \\]\n\n   This shows that $(z, w)$ commutes with $(g, h)$, and since $(g, h)$ was arbitrary, $(z, w)$ commutes with every element of $G \\times H$. Thus, $(z, w) \\in Z(G \\times H)$.\n\n2. **Show $Z(G \\times H) \\subseteq Z(G) \\times Z(H)$:**\n\n   Now, take any element $(a, b) \\in Z(G \\times H)$. This means $(a, b)$ commutes with every element of $G \\times H$. In particular, it must commute with elements of the form $(g, e_H)$ and $(e_G, h)$, where $e_G$ and $e_H$ are the identity elements of $G$ and $H$, respectively.\n\n   - For $(g, e_H)$, we have:\n\n     \\[\n     (a, b)(g, e_H) = (ag, be_H) = (ag, b)\n     \\]\n\n     \\[\n     (g, e_H)(a, b) = (ga, b)\n     \\]\n\n     Since $(a, b)$ commutes with $(g, e_H)$, we have $(ag, b) = (ga, b)$, which implies $ag = ga$. Thus, $a$ commutes with every element of $G$, so $a \\in Z(G)$.\n\n   - For $(e_G, h)$, we have:\n\n     \\[\n     (a, b)(e_G, h) = (ae_G, bh) = (a, bh)\n     \\]\n\n     \\[\n     (e_G, h)(a, b) = (a, hb)\n     \\]\n\n     Since $(a, b)$ commutes with $(e_G, h)$, we have $(a, bh) = (a, hb)$, which implies $bh = hb$. Thus, $b$ commutes with every element of $H$, so $b \\in Z(H)$.\n\n   Therefore, $(a, b) \\in Z(G) \\times Z(H)$.\n\nSince we have shown both inclusions, $Z(G \\times H) = Z(G) \\times Z(H)$.

A field is a set equipped with two operations, addition and multiplication, satisfying certain properties. Importantly, every non-zero element in a field has a multiplicative inverse. This property is crucial for our proof.\n\nNow, consider a homomorphism \\(\\phi: F \\to S\\) from a field \\(F\\) to another ring \\(S\\). A homomorphism is a function that respects the operations of addition and multiplication. Specifically, for any elements \\(a, b \\in F\\), we have:\n- \\(\\phi(a + b) = \\phi(a) + \\phi(b)\\)\n- \\(\\phi(a \\cdot b) = \\phi(a) \\cdot \\phi(b)\\)\n\nWe need to show that \\(\\phi\\) is injective, meaning that if \\(\\phi(a) = \\phi(b)\\), then \\(a = b\\).\n\nThe theorem from the context states that a ring homomorphism from a field is either injective (a monomorphism) or the zero homomorphism. The zero homomorphism is a special case where every element in the field is mapped to the zero element of the ring \\(S\\).\n\nLet's explore these two possibilities:\n\n1. **Zero Homomorphism**: If \\(\\phi\\) is the zero homomorphism, then for every element \\(a \\in F\\), \\(\\phi(a) = 0_S\\), where \\(0_S\\) is the zero element in \\(S\\). However, if \\(\\phi\\) is the zero homomorphism, it cannot be injective unless \\(F\\) is the trivial field (which only contains the zero element). In most cases, fields are not trivial, so the zero homomorphism is not injective.\n\n2. **Injective Homomorphism**: If \\(\\phi\\) is not the zero homomorphism, then there exists some element \\(a \\in F\\) such that \\(\\phi(a) \\neq 0_S\\). Because \\(F\\) is a field, every non-zero element has an inverse. Let's consider such a non-zero element \\(a\\) and its inverse \\(a^{-1}\\). We have:\n   - \\(\\phi(a \\cdot a^{-1}) = \\phi(1_F) = 1_S\\), where \\(1_F\\) and \\(1_S\\) are the multiplicative identities in \\(F\\) and \\(S\\), respectively.\n   - Since \\(\\phi(a) \\neq 0_S\\), \\(\\phi(a^{-1})\\) must exist and satisfy \\(\\phi(a) \\cdot \\phi(a^{-1}) = 1_S\\).\n\nThis shows that \\(\\phi\\) preserves the multiplicative structure of \\(F\\), and since \\(\\phi\\) is not the zero homomorphism, it must be injective. If \\(\\phi(a) = \\phi(b)\\), then \\(\\phi(a - b) = 0_S\\). But since \\(\\phi\\) is injective, \\(a - b\\) must be zero, implying \\(a = b\\).\n\nTherefore, every homomorphism of fields is injective unless it is the zero homomorphism, which is not injective for non-trivial fields. Thus, in the context of non-trivial fields, every homomorphism is indeed injective.",

A proper subspace of \\( V \\) is a subspace that is strictly smaller than \\( V \\) itself, meaning it does not contain all the elements of \\( V \\).\n\nSuppose, for the sake of contradiction, that \\( V \\) can be written as the union of finitely many proper subspaces, say \\( U_1, U_2, \\ldots, U_n \\). Our goal is to show that this leads to a contradiction.\n\n1. **Minimality Argument**: Assume \\( n \\) is the smallest number of proper subspaces needed to cover \\( V \\). This means that if we could cover \\( V \\) with fewer than \\( n \\) subspaces, it would contradict our assumption of minimality.\n\n2. **Choosing Elements**: Since \\( U_1 \\) is a proper subspace, there exists at least one element \\( y \\) in \\( V \\) that is not in \\( U_1 \\). Choose such a \\( y \\).\n\n3. **Using the Infinite Field**: Because \\( F \\) is infinite, we can select a set \\( S \\) of \\( n+1 \\) distinct scalars from \\( F \\). For each scalar \\( \\alpha \\) in \\( S \\), consider the element \\( x + \\alpha y \\) where \\( x \\) is any element of \\( U_1 \\).\n\n4. **Subspace Assignment**: Since \\( V = U_1 \\cup U_2 \\cup \\cdots \\cup U_n \\), each \\( x + \\alpha y \\) must belong to one of these subspaces. Define a function \\( i: S \\to \\{1, 2, \\ldots, n\\} \\) such that \\( x + \\alpha y \\in U_{i(\\alpha)} \\).\n\n5. **Non-injectivity of the Function**: The function \\( i \\) cannot be injective because there are \\( n+1 \\) elements in \\( S \\) but only \\( n \\) subspaces. Therefore, there exist distinct \\( \\alpha \\) and \\( \\beta \\) in \\( S \\) such that \\( i(\\alpha) = i(\\beta) \\).\n\n6. **Deriving a Contradiction**: Since \\( x + \\alpha y \\) and \\( x + \\beta y \\) are both in the same subspace \\( U_{i(\\alpha)} \\), their difference, which is \\( (\\alpha - \\beta)y \\), must also be in \\( U_{i(\\alpha)} \\). But this implies \\( y \\) is in \\( U_{i(\\alpha)} \\), contradicting our choice of \\( y \\) not being in \\( U_1 \\).\n\n7. **Conclusion**: This contradiction implies that our initial assumption that \\( V \\) can be covered by finitely many proper subspaces is false.

A simple group is one that has no normal subgroups other than the trivial group and the group itself.\n\nLet's consider a group \\( G \\) of order \\( pq \\). By Lagrange's Theorem, the order of any subgroup of \\( G \\) must divide the order of \\( G \\), which is \\( pq \\). Therefore, the possible orders of subgroups of \\( G \\) are 1, \\( p \\), \\( q \\), and \\( pq \\).\n\nNow, let's apply Sylow's theorems, which help us understand the number and structure of subgroups of prime power order. According to Sylow's theorems, the number of Sylow \\( p \\)-subgroups, denoted \\( n_p \\), must satisfy two conditions:\n1. \\( n_p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p} \\)\n2. \\( n_p \\) divides \\( q \\)\n\nSince \\( n_p \\) divides \\( q \\) and \\( q \\) is a prime, \\( n_p \\) can be either 1 or \\( q \\).

Therefore, we must have \\( n_2 = 7 \\) and \\( n_7 = 32 \\).\n\nHowever, if \\( n_2 = 7 \\), then the index of the normalizer of a Sylow 2-subgroup is 7. By the theorem that the order of a simple group divides the factorial of the index of a subgroup, the order of \\( G \\) must divide \\( 7! = 5040 \\). Since 224 does divide 5040, this condition is satisfied, but it does not help us conclude simplicity.\n\nSimilarly, if \\( n_7 = 32 \\), the index of the normalizer of a Sylow 7-subgroup is 32. The order of \\( G \\) must divide \\( 32! \\), which is a very large number, and 224 certainly divides it.\n\nHowever, the key observation is that having both \\( n_2 = 7 \\) and \\( n_7 = 32 \\) leads to a contradiction in the structure of the group. The product of the indices of the normalizers (7 and 32) exceeds the order of the group, which is not possible. This contradiction arises because the group cannot accommodate such a configuration of Sylow subgroups without having a normal subgroup.\n\nThus, our assumption that \\( G \\) is simple must be false. Therefore, no group of order 224 can be simple.",

By definition, an element \\( x \\) is nilpotent if there exists some positive integer \\( n \\) such that \\( x^n = 0_R \\), where \\( 0_R \\) is the zero element of the ring.\n\nNow, we need to show that \\( 1 + x \\) is a unit in \\( R \\). An element is a unit if there exists another element in the ring that, when multiplied with it, results in the unity (or identity) element of the ring, denoted \\( 1_R \\).\n\nTo find such an element, we can use a technique similar to the one used in the context provided. Consider the expression:\n\n\\[ (1 + x) \\cdot (1 - x + x^2 - x^3 + \\cdots + (-1)^{n-1}x^{n-1}) \\]\n\nLet's expand this product:\n\n1. The first term, \\( 1 \\cdot (1 - x + x^2 - x^3 + \\cdots + (-1)^{n-1}x^{n-1}) \\), simplifies to \\( 1 - x + x^2 - x^3 + \\cdots + (-1)^{n-1}x^{n-1} \\).\n\n2. The second term, \\( x \\cdot (1 - x + x^2 - x^3 + \\cdots + (-1)^{n-1}x^{n-1}) \\), expands to \\( x - x^2 + x^3 - \\cdots + (-1)^{n-1}x^n \\).\n\nWhen we add these two results together, the terms cancel out in pairs:\n\n- The \\( x \\) from the first term cancels with the \\( -x \\) from the second term.\n- The \\( x^2 \\) from the first term cancels with the \\( -x^2 \\) from the second term.\n- This pattern continues up to \\( x^{n-1} \\).\n\nFinally, the last term \\( (-1)^{n-1}x^n \\) is zero because \\( x^n = 0_R \\).\n\nThus, the entire expression simplifies to \\( 1_R \\), the unity of the ring. This shows that:\n\n\\[ (1 + x) \\cdot (1 - x + x^2 - x^3 + \\cdots + (-1)^{n-1}x^{n-1}) = 1_R \\]\n\nTherefore, \\( 1 - x + x^2 - x^3 + \\cdots + (-1)^{n-1}x^{n-1} \\) is the multiplicative inverse of \\( 1 + x \\), proving that \\( 1 + x \\) is indeed a unit in the ring \\( R \\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  GroupWithZero R\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nunsolved goals\nR : Type u_1\ninst\u271d : Ring R\nx : R\nhx : IsNilpotent x\nn : \u2115\nhn : x ^ n = 0\n\u22a2 \u2211 i \u2208 Finset.range n, (-1) ^ i * x ^ i + x * \u2211 i \u2208 Finset.range n, (-1) ^ i * x ^ i = 1\nunsolved goals\nR : Type u_1\ninst\u271d : Ring R\nx : R\nhx : IsNilpotent x\nn : \u2115\nhn : x ^ n = 0\nh : (1 + x) * \u2211 i \u2208 Finset.range n, (-1) ^ i * x ^ i = 1\n\u22a2 \u00ac1 + x = 0\nPlease revise the proof.",

This set forms a ring, which is a type of algebraic structure that supports addition, subtraction, and multiplication.\n\nAn ideal in a ring is a subset that is closed under addition and under multiplication by any element of the ring. In simpler terms, if you take any element from the ideal and multiply it by any Gaussian integer, the result is still in the ideal.\n\nNow, let's consider a nonzero ideal \\(J\\) in \\(\\mathbb{Z}[i]\\). By definition, since \\(J\\) is nonzero, it contains at least one nonzero element. Our goal is to show that \\(J\\) must also contain a nonzero integer.\n\nThe key to this proof is the fact that \\(\\mathbb{Z}[i]\\) is a principal ideal domain (PID). This means every ideal in \\(\\mathbb{Z}[i]\\) is generated by a single element. In other words, there exists some element \\(d \\in \\mathbb{Z}[i]\\) such that every element of the ideal \\(J\\) can be expressed as a multiple of \\(d\\).\n\nTo find such a \\(d\\), we can use the concept of modulus in the complex plane. The modulus of a Gaussian integer \\(a + bi\\) is \\(\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\\). In a PID, we can choose \\(d\\) to be the element of smallest nonzero modulus in the ideal \\(J\\).\n\nNow, consider the modulus of \\(d\\). If \\(d\\) is not a nonzero integer, it must have a nonzero imaginary part, meaning \\(b \\neq 0\\). However, using the division algorithm for Gaussian integers, we can express any Gaussian integer \\(a + bi\\) in terms of another Gaussian integer with a smaller modulus. This process can be repeated until we reach a Gaussian integer with no imaginary part, i.e., a nonzero integer.\n\nTherefore, by choosing \\(d\\) as the generator of the ideal \\(J\\) with the smallest modulus, and using the division algorithm, we can ensure that \\(J\\) contains a nonzero integer. This completes the proof that every nonzero ideal in the ring of Gaussian integers contains a nonzero integer.\nPrevious attempt failed with: \nPlease revise the proof.",

Notice that \\(N\\) is constructed to be congruent to \\(-1\\) modulo 4, because \\(4(p_1p_2 \\cdots p_n)\\) is clearly divisible by 4, making it congruent to 0 modulo 4, and subtracting 1 gives us \\(-1\\) modulo 4.\n\nNext, let's analyze the prime factors of \\(N\\). Since \\(N\\) is not divisible by any of the primes \\(p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n\\) (because it leaves a remainder of \\(-1\\) when divided by any of these primes), \\(N\\) must have a prime factor that is not in our list of \\(p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n\\).\n\nMoreover, any prime factor of \\(N\\) must also be congruent to \\(-1\\) modulo 4. This is because if a prime \\(q\\) divides \\(N\\), then \\(N \\equiv 0 \\pmod{q}\\), and since \\(N \\equiv -1 \\pmod{4}\\), it follows that \\(q\\) must also be congruent to \\(-1\\) modulo 4 (as primes congruent to 1 modulo 4 cannot divide numbers congruent to \\(-1\\) modulo 4).\n\nThus, we have found a new prime, not in our original list, that is congruent to \\(-1\\) modulo 4. This contradicts our assumption that there were only finitely many such primes. Therefore, our assumption must be false, and there must be infinitely many primes congruent to \\(-1\\) modulo 4.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

These nonzero elements form a multiplicative group under the field's multiplication operation. This group is cyclic, meaning there exists an element \\( g \\) in \\( K \\) such that every nonzero element of \\( K \\) can be expressed as a power of \\( g \\). Specifically, the nonzero elements are \\( g, g^2, \\ldots, g^{q-1} \\), where \\( g^{q-1} = 1 \\) because the order of the group is \\( q - 1 \\).\n\nNow, consider the product of all nonzero elements of \\( K \\). Since the nonzero elements form a cyclic group, the product of all elements in this group is the same as the product of all powers of \\( g \\) from 1 to \\( q-1 \\). This product can be written as:\n\n\\[\ng \\times g^2 \\times \\cdots \\times g^{q-1} = g^{1 + 2 + \\cdots + (q-1)}\n\\]\n\nThe sum \\( 1 + 2 + \\cdots + (q-1) \\) is a well-known arithmetic series, which can be calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(q-1)q}{2}\n\\]\n\nSince \\( g^{q-1} = 1 \\), raising \\( g \\) to any multiple of \\( q-1 \\) will result in 1. Therefore, we need to consider the exponent modulo \\( q-1 \\). The sum \\( \\frac{(q-1)q}{2} \\) is congruent to \\( \\frac{q}{2} \\) modulo \\( q-1 \\).\n\nNow, we need to determine whether \\( \\frac{q}{2} \\) is even or odd. If \\( q \\) is even, then \\( \\frac{q}{2} \\) is an integer, and the product of all nonzero elements is \\( g^{q-1} = 1 \\). However, if \\( q \\) is odd, then \\( \\frac{q}{2} \\) is not an integer, and the product of all nonzero elements is \\( g^{q-1/2} = -1 \\).\n\nIn a finite field, the characteristic is a prime number, and \\( q \\) is a power of this prime. If \\( q \\) is odd, then the product of all nonzero elements is \\(-1\\). This is the case for all finite fields of odd order, which is the typical scenario for finite fields used in many applications.\n\nThus, the product of the nonzero elements of a finite field \\( K \\) is \\(-1\\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

A vector space \\( V \\) over a field \\( F \\) is a set equipped with two operations: vector addition and scalar multiplication. The field \\( F \\) has two special elements: the additive identity \\( 0_F \\) and the multiplicative identity \\( 1_F \\). In a vector space, the zero vector, denoted \\( \\bszero \\), acts as the additive identity for vector addition.\n\nNow, consider the equation \\( a \\circ v = \\bszero \\). This equation states that when the scalar \\( a \\) is multiplied by the vector \\( v \\), the result is the zero vector. We want to show that this implies either \\( a = 0_F \\) or \\( v = \\bszero \\).\n\n1. **Case 1: \\( a = 0_F \\):** If \\( a \\) is the zero element of the field \\( F \\), then by the properties of scalar multiplication in a vector space, \\( 0_F \\circ v = \\bszero \\) for any vector \\( v \\). This is because multiplying any vector by the zero scalar results in the zero vector, as shown in the context with the theorem \"Vector Scaled by Zero is Zero Vector.\"\n\n2. **Case 2: \\( v = \\bszero \\):** If \\( v \\) is the zero vector, then for any scalar \\( a \\), \\( a \\circ \\bszero = \\bszero \\). This is because the zero vector, when scaled by any scalar, remains the zero vector.\n\n3. **Case 3: \\( a \\neq 0_F \\) and \\( v \\neq \\bszero \\):** Suppose \\( a \\neq 0_F \\) and \\( v \\neq \\bszero \\). We need to show that this leads to a contradiction. If \\( a \\neq 0_F \\), then \\( a \\) has a multiplicative inverse \\( a^{-1} \\) in the field \\( F \\). We can multiply both sides of the equation \\( a \\circ v = \\bszero \\) by \\( a^{-1} \\) to get:\n   \\[\n   a^{-1} \\circ (a \\circ v) = a^{-1} \\circ \\bszero\n   \\]\n   By the associativity of scalar multiplication, this simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   (a^{-1} \\cdot a) \\circ v = \\bszero\n   \\]\n   Since \\( a^{-1} \\cdot a = 1_F \\), we have:\n   \\[\n   1_F \\circ v = \\bszero\n   \\]\n   But \\( 1_F \\circ v = v \\) by the definition of the multiplicative identity in a field. Therefore, \\( v = \\bszero \\), which contradicts our assumption that \\( v \\neq \\bszero \\).\n\nThus, if \\( a \\circ v = \\bszero \\), it must be that either \\( a = 0_F \\) or \\( v = \\bszero \\).

The range of \\( T \\), denoted as \\(\\operatorname{range} T\\), is the set of all vectors in \\( W \\) that can be expressed as \\( T(v) \\) for some \\( v \\in V \\).\n\n2. **Finite Dimensionality**: Since \\( V \\) is finite-dimensional, we can apply the rank-nullity theorem. This theorem states that the dimension of \\( V \\) is the sum of the dimensions of the kernel and the range of \\( T \\). This gives us a clear relationship between these subspaces.\n\n3. **Constructing the Subspace \\( U \\)**: We want to find a subspace \\( U \\) of \\( V \\) such that \\( U \\cap \\operatorname{null} T = \\{0\\} \\). This means that no non-zero vector in \\( U \\) should be mapped to zero by \\( T \\).

Extend this basis to a basis for the entire space \\( V \\). The vectors that are added to extend the basis of the kernel to a basis of \\( V \\) will form a basis for the subspace \\( U \\).\n\n5. **Properties of \\( U \\)**: By construction, \\( U \\) is a subspace of \\( V \\) that does not intersect the kernel of \\( T \\) except at the zero vector. This ensures that every non-zero vector in \\( U \\) is mapped to a non-zero vector in \\( W \\).\n\n6. **Range of \\( T \\)**: Since \\( U \\) is chosen such that it complements the kernel, the image of \\( U \\) under \\( T \\) will span the range of \\( T \\). This is because the vectors in \\( U \\) are precisely those that contribute to the range, as they are not annihilated by \\( T \\).\n\n7. **Conclusion**: Therefore, we have constructed a subspace \\( U \\) such that \\( U \\cap \\operatorname{null} T = \\{0\\} \\) and \\(\\operatorname{range} T = \\{T(u) : u \\in U\\}\\). This satisfies the conditions of the problem, completing the proof.\n\nIn summary, by leveraging the finite-dimensionality of \\( V \\) and the properties of linear transformations, we can construct a subspace \\( U \\) that meets the required conditions, demonstrating the existence of such a subspace.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'let'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

Formally, a vector \\( v \\) in \\( U_1 + U_2 + \\cdots + U_m \\) can be written as \\( v = u_1 + u_2 + \\cdots + u_m \\), where \\( u_i \\in U_i \\) for each \\( i \\).\n\nTo show that \\( U_1 + U_2 + \\cdots + U_m \\) is invariant under \\( T \\), we need to demonstrate that applying \\( T \\) to any vector \\( v \\) in this sum results in a vector that is still in the sum. So, consider \\( T(v) = T(u_1 + u_2 + \\cdots + u_m) \\). Using the linearity of \\( T \\), we have:\n\n\\[ T(v) = T(u_1) + T(u_2) + \\cdots + T(u_m). \\]\n\nSince each \\( U_i \\) is invariant under \\( T \\), we know that \\( T(u_i) \\) is in \\( U_i \\) for each \\( i \\). Therefore, the vector \\( T(v) \\), which is the sum \\( T(u_1) + T(u_2) + \\cdots + T(u_m) \\), is a sum of vectors where each component is in its respective subspace \\( U_i \\).\n\nThus, \\( T(v) \\) is in \\( U_1 + U_2 + \\cdots + U_m \\), showing that the sum of the subspaces is indeed invariant under \\( T \\). This completes the proof that \\( U_1 + U_2 + \\cdots + U_m \\) is invariant under the linear transformation \\( T \\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

If a subspace \\( U \\) of \\( V \\) is invariant under \\( T \\), then for every vector \\( \\mathbf{u} \\) in \\( U \\), the image \\( T(\\mathbf{u}) \\) is also in \\( U \\).\n\nNow, consider the vector space \\( V \\) and its dimension \\( n = \\operatorname{dim} V \\). The condition states that every subspace of dimension \\( n-1 \\) is invariant under \\( T \\). This implies that if we take any vector \\( \\mathbf{v} \\) in \\( V \\), the subspace spanned by all vectors except \\( \\mathbf{v} \\) (which has dimension \\( n-1 \\)) is invariant under \\( T \\).\n\nLet's choose a basis for \\( V \\), say \\(\\{\\mathbf{e}_1, \\mathbf{e}_2, \\ldots, \\mathbf{e}_n\\}\\). For each basis vector \\(\\mathbf{e}_i\\), consider the subspace spanned by all other basis vectors \\(\\{\\mathbf{e}_1, \\ldots, \\mathbf{e}_{i-1}, \\mathbf{e}_{i+1}, \\ldots, \\mathbf{e}_n\\}\\). This subspace has dimension \\( n-1 \\) and is invariant under \\( T \\).\n\nSince each of these subspaces is invariant, the image of any basis vector under \\( T \\) must be expressible as a linear combination of the other basis vectors. However, this must hold for every basis vector, which strongly suggests that \\( T(\\mathbf{e}_i) \\) is actually a scalar multiple of \\(\\mathbf{e}_i\\) itself. Otherwise, the invariance condition would be violated.\n\nThus, for each basis vector \\(\\mathbf{e}_i\\), we have \\( T(\\mathbf{e}_i) = \\lambda_i \\mathbf{e}_i \\) for some scalar \\(\\lambda_i\\). If all \\(\\lambda_i\\) are equal, say \\(\\lambda\\), then \\( T \\) acts as \\(\\lambda I\\), where \\( I \\) is the identity operator. This is because \\( T(\\mathbf{v}) = \\lambda \\mathbf{v} \\) for any vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) in \\( V \\), which is precisely the action of a scalar multiple of the identity.\n\nTo conclude, the condition that every \\((n-1)\\)-dimensional subspace is invariant under \\( T \\) forces \\( T \\) to be a scalar multiple of the identity operator, as any deviation from this would violate the invariance of these subspaces. Therefore, \\( T = \\lambda I \\) for some scalar \\(\\lambda\\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'let'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "# Informal Proof:\n\nTo tackle this problem, we need to understand the implications of a linear transformation \\( T \\) on a real vector space \\( V \\) that has no eigenvalues. This means that for any vector \\( v \\) in \\( V \\), the equation \\( T(v) = \\lambda v \\) has no real solutions for \\( \\lambda \\). In other words, \\( T \\) does not stretch or shrink any vector by a real scalar factor, which is a key characteristic of having no eigenvalues.\n\nNow, consider a subspace \\( W \\) of \\( V \\) that is invariant under \\( T \\). This means that if you take any vector in \\( W \\) and apply \\( T \\), the resulting vector is still in \\( W \\). Our goal is to show that the dimension of such a subspace \\( W \\) must be even.\n\nTo understand why this is the case, let's delve into the properties of linear transformations and vector spaces. A linear transformation with no real eigenvalues often suggests a form of rotation or complex behavior in the space. In two dimensions, for example, a rotation matrix has no real eigenvalues unless it is a trivial rotation (i.e., identity or 180-degree rotation). This rotational behavior can be generalized to higher dimensions, where the transformation can be seen as a combination of rotations in various two-dimensional planes.\n\nWhen \\( T \\) acts on \\( V \\), it can be represented in a suitable basis as a block diagonal matrix with \\( 2 \\times 2 \\) blocks, each corresponding to a rotation in a two-dimensional plane. This is because, in the absence of real eigenvalues, the transformation cannot be reduced to a diagonal form with real entries. Each \\( 2 \\times 2 \\) block corresponds to a complex eigenvalue pair, which represents a rotation.\n\nNow, if \\( W \\) is invariant under \\( T \\), it must be able to accommodate these rotational actions. Since each rotation affects a two-dimensional plane, the smallest subspace that can be invariant under such a transformation must have an even dimension. This is because each \\( 2 \\times 2 \\) block requires two dimensions to act upon.\n\nTherefore, any invariant subspace \\( W \\) must be composed of these two-dimensional rotational components, leading to the conclusion that the dimension of \\( W \\) is even. This reasoning aligns with the structure of linear transformations without real eigenvalues, which inherently involve complex or rotational dynamics that necessitate even-dimensional subspaces for invariance.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

Specifically, a subspace must be closed under addition and scalar multiplication, and it must contain the zero vector (in this case, the zero operator).\n\nFirst, let's recall what a normal operator is. An operator \\( T \\) on a vector space \\( V \\) is normal if it commutes with its adjoint, i.e., \\( TT^* = T^*T \\).\n\n1. **Zero Operator**: The zero operator is trivially normal because it commutes with itself and its adjoint (which is also the zero operator). So, the set of normal operators does contain the zero operator.\n\n2. **Closure under Addition**: For the set of normal operators to be a subspace, the sum of any two normal operators must also be normal. However, this is not generally true. Consider two normal operators \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) on \\( V \\). For their sum \\( A + B \\) to be normal, it must satisfy \\((A + B)(A + B)^* = (A + B)^*(A + B)\\).

This is because \\((\\lambda T)(\\lambda T)^* = |\\lambda|^2 TT^* = |\\lambda|^2 T^*T = (\\lambda T)^*(\\lambda T)\\).\n\nSince the set of normal operators fails to be closed under addition, it cannot be a subspace of \\(\\mathcal{L}(V)\\).

If all eigenvalues of a normal operator are real, then the operator is self-adjoint:**\n\nAssume \\( \\hat{N} \\) is a normal operator and all its eigenvalues are real. We want to show that \\( \\hat{N} \\) is self-adjoint, i.e., \\( \\hat{N} = \\hat{N}^\\dagger \\).\n\nSince \\( \\hat{N} \\) is normal, it can be diagonalized by a unitary matrix. This means there exists a basis of eigenvectors for \\( \\hat{N} \\), and the operator can be expressed as a diagonal matrix with its eigenvalues on the diagonal. Given that all eigenvalues are real, the diagonal matrix is real, and thus, its adjoint (or conjugate transpose) is itself. Therefore, \\( \\hat{N} = \\hat{N}^\\dagger \\), proving that \\( \\hat{N} \\) is self-adjoint.\n\n**2. If a normal operator is self-adjoint, then all its eigenvalues are real:**\n\nNow, assume \\( \\hat{N} \\) is self-adjoint, meaning \\( \\hat{N} = \\hat{N}^\\dagger \\). We need to show that all eigenvalues of \\( \\hat{N} \\) are real.\n\nFrom the context provided, we know that for a self-adjoint operator, the eigenvalues are real. This is because, for any eigenvector \\( \\left\\vert{x}\\right\\rangle \\) with eigenvalue \\( \\lambda \\), the inner product \\( \\left\\langle{x}\\middle\\vert{\\hat{N}}\\middle\\vert{x}\\right\\rangle = \\lambda \\left\\langle{x}\\middle\\vert{x}\\right\\rangle \\) is equal to its complex conjugate, implying \\( \\lambda = \\lambda^* \\), which means \\( \\lambda \\) is real.\n\nThus, if \\( \\hat{N} \\) is self-adjoint, all its eigenvalues must be real.\n\nIn conclusion, a normal operator on a complex inner-product space is self-adjoint if and only if all its eigenvalues are real.

        "informal_proof": "# Informal Proof:\n\nTo prove that every normal operator on a complex inner-product space has a square root, we need to understand a few key concepts and leverage some properties of normal operators.\n\nFirst, let's recall what a normal operator is. An operator \\( T \\) on a complex inner-product space \\( V \\) is normal if it commutes with its adjoint, i.e., \\( T T^* = T^* T \\). This property is crucial because it implies that \\( T \\) can be diagonalized by a unitary transformation. In simpler terms, there exists an orthonormal basis of \\( V \\) consisting of eigenvectors of \\( T \\), and \\( T \\) can be represented as a diagonal matrix with respect to this basis.\n\nNow, consider the spectral theorem for normal operators, which states that any normal operator \\( T \\) can be expressed in terms of its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Specifically, if \\( T \\) is normal, it can be written as \\( T = UDU^* \\), where \\( U \\) is a unitary operator (essentially a change of basis matrix), and \\( D \\) is a diagonal matrix whose entries are the eigenvalues of \\( T \\).\n\nThe problem asks us to find a square root of \\( T \\), which means we need an operator \\( S \\) such that \\( S^2 = T \\). Given the diagonal form of \\( T \\), a natural approach is to consider the square root of the diagonal matrix \\( D \\). Since \\( D \\) is diagonal, taking the square root of each of its diagonal entries (which are the eigenvalues of \\( T \\)) gives us another diagonal matrix \\( D^{1/2} \\).\n\nThus, we can construct the operator \\( S \\) as \\( S = UD^{1/2}U^* \\). This operator \\( S \\) is also normal because it is constructed in the same way as \\( T \\), using the unitary matrix \\( U \\) and a diagonal matrix \\( D^{1/2} \\). Moreover, when we compute \\( S^2 \\), we get:\n\n\\[ S^2 = (UD^{1/2}U^*)(UD^{1/2}U^*) = U(D^{1/2}D^{1/2})U^* = UDU^* = T. \\]\n\nTherefore, \\( S \\) is indeed a square root of \\( T \\).\n\nIn summary, the key to finding a square root of a normal operator lies in its diagonalizability. By taking the square root of the eigenvalues (which are the diagonal entries of \\( D \\)), we construct a new operator that, when squared, gives back the original operator \\( T \\). This process is made possible by the spectral theorem, which ensures that normal operators can be expressed in a form that makes taking square roots straightforward.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'let'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

Let's break down the reasoning step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem: We have a group \\( G \\) with a binary operation (let's call it multiplication for simplicity) and an identity element \\( e \\). For any elements \\( a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n \\) in this group, we want to show that the inverse of the product \\( a_1 a_2 \\cdots a_n \\) is equal to \\( a_n^{-1} a_{n-1}^{-1} \\cdots a_1^{-1} \\).\n\n### Base Case:\nStart with the simplest case, where \\( n = 1 \\). Here, the product is just \\( a_1 \\), and its inverse is \\( a_1^{-1} \\). This matches the statement \\( (a_1)^{-1} = a_1^{-1} \\), so the base case holds.\n\n### Inductive Step:\nAssume that the statement is true for some \\( k \\geq 1 \\); that is, assume \\( (a_1 a_2 \\cdots a_k)^{-1} = a_k^{-1} a_{k-1}^{-1} \\cdots a_1^{-1} \\). This is our induction hypothesis.\n\nNow, consider the case for \\( k + 1 \\) elements: \\( a_1 a_2 \\cdots a_k a_{k+1} \\). We need to show that the inverse of this product is \\( a_{k+1}^{-1} a_k^{-1} \\cdots a_1^{-1} \\).\n\nUsing the property of inverses in a group, we know that the inverse of a product \\( (xy)^{-1} \\) is \\( y^{-1} x^{-1} \\). Applying this to our product, we have:\n\n1. First, consider the product \\( a_1 a_2 \\cdots a_k \\) as a single element, say \\( A \\). By the induction hypothesis, we know \\( A^{-1} = a_k^{-1} a_{k-1}^{-1} \\cdots a_1^{-1} \\).\n\n2. Now, the product \\( a_1 a_2 \\cdots a_k a_{k+1} \\) can be seen as \\( A a_{k+1} \\).\n\n3. The inverse of this product is \\( (A a_{k+1})^{-1} = a_{k+1}^{-1} A^{-1} \\).\n\n4. Substitute the expression for \\( A^{-1} \\) from the induction hypothesis: \\( a_{k+1}^{-1} A^{-1} = a_{k+1}^{-1} (a_k^{-1} a_{k-1}^{-1} \\cdots a_1^{-1}) \\).\n\n5. This simplifies to \\( a_{k+1}^{-1} a_k^{-1} a_{k-1}^{-1} \\cdots a_1^{-1} \\), which is exactly what we need to prove for \\( k + 1 \\).\n\n### Conclusion:\nBy the principle of mathematical induction, since the base case holds and the inductive step is valid, the statement is true for all positive integers \\( n \\). Therefore, for any elements \\( a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n \\) in a group, the inverse of their product is indeed the product of their inverses in reverse order: \\( (a_1 a_2 \\cdots a_n)^{-1} = a_n^{-1} a_{n-1}^{-1} \\cdots a_1^{-1} \\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'with'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

A symmetric group $S_{\\Omega}$ consists of all permutations of the set $\\Omega$. A permutation is a bijective function from a set to itself, meaning it rearranges the elements of the set in a one-to-one and onto manner.\n\n1. **Closure**: If you take any two permutations of $\\Omega$, say $f$ and $g$, and compose them (perform one after the other), the result is another permutation of $\\Omega$. This is because the composition of two bijections is also a bijection. Therefore, $S_{\\Omega}$ is closed under composition.\n\n2. **Associativity**: Function composition is associative. This means that for any three permutations $f$, $g$, and $h$ in $S_{\\Omega}$, the equation $(f \\circ g) \\circ h = f \\circ (g \\circ h)$ holds. This property is inherited from the general property of function composition.\n\n3. **Identity Element**: The identity permutation, which maps every element of $\\Omega$ to itself, is in $S_{\\Omega}$. This permutation acts as the identity element because composing any permutation with the identity permutation leaves the original permutation unchanged.\n\n4. **Inverses**: Every permutation has an inverse permutation that undoes its action. If $f$ is a permutation in $S_{\\Omega}$, then there exists a permutation $f^{-1}$ such that $f \\circ f^{-1}$ and $f^{-1} \\circ f$ both yield the identity permutation. This ensures that every element in $S_{\\Omega}$ has an inverse.\n\nHaving established that $S_{\\Omega}$ satisfies all the group axioms, we can conclude that it is a group.\n\nNext, we need to show that $S_{\\Omega}$ is infinite. The set $\\Omega$ is infinite, as it contains all natural numbers. For any finite subset of $\\Omega$, say $\\{1, 2, \\ldots, n\\}$, the symmetric group on this subset, $S_n$, is finite with $n!$ elements. However, as $n$ increases, $n!$ also increases without bound. Since $\\Omega$ is infinite, we can consider permutations that affect arbitrarily large finite subsets of $\\Omega$. \n\nMoreover, for any natural number $n$, we can construct a permutation that only permutes the first $n$ elements and leaves the rest fixed. There are infinitely many such permutations as $n$ can be any natural number. This implies that there are infinitely many distinct permutations in $S_{\\Omega}$, making $S_{\\Omega}$ an infinite group.\n\nThus, $S_{\\Omega}$ is an infinite group because it satisfies the group axioms and contains infinitely many elements.",

In $A \\times B$, each element is a pair $(a, b)$ where $a \\in A$ and $b \\in B$. The group operation on $A \\times B$ is defined component-wise: for two elements $(a_1, b_1)$ and $(a_2, b_2)$ in $A \\times B$, their product is $(a_1 \\cdot a_2, b_1 \\cdot b_2)$, where $\\cdot$ denotes the group operation in $A$ and $B$ respectively.\n\nSimilarly, in $B \\times A$, each element is a pair $(b, a)$ where $b \\in B$ and $a \\in A$. The group operation is defined similarly: for two elements $(b_1, a_1)$ and $(b_2, a_2)$ in $B \\times A$, their product is $(b_1 \\cdot b_2, a_1 \\cdot a_2)$.\n\nNow, let's construct a mapping $\\theta: A \\times B \\to B \\times A$ defined by $\\theta(a, b) = (b, a)$. This mapping simply swaps the components of each pair.\n\n1. **Homomorphism**: We need to show that $\\theta$ preserves the group operation. Take any two elements $(a_1, b_1)$ and $(a_2, b_2)$ in $A \\times B$. Their product in $A \\times B$ is $(a_1 \\cdot a_2, b_1 \\cdot b_2)$. Applying $\\theta$, we get $\\theta(a_1 \\cdot a_2, b_1 \\cdot b_2) = (b_1 \\cdot b_2, a_1 \\cdot a_2)$. On the other hand, applying $\\theta$ to each element first gives us $\\theta(a_1, b_1) = (b_1, a_1)$ and $\\theta(a_2, b_2) = (b_2, a_2)$. Their product in $B \\times A$ is $(b_1 \\cdot b_2, a_1 \\cdot a_2)$. Since these two results are the same, $\\theta$ is a homomorphism.\n\n2. **Bijectivity**: We need to show that $\\theta$ is both injective and surjective.\n   - **Injective**: Suppose $\\theta(a_1, b_1) = \\theta(a_2, b_2)$. This means $(b_1, a_1) = (b_2, a_2)$. Therefore, $b_1 = b_2$ and $a_1 = a_2$, which implies $(a_1, b_1) = (a_2, b_2)$. Thus, $\\theta$ is injective.\n   - **Surjective**: For any element $(b, a)$ in $B \\times A$, we can find a corresponding element $(a, b)$ in $A \\times B$ such that $\\theta(a, b) = (b, a)$. Therefore, $\\theta$ is surjective.\n\nSince $\\theta$ is a bijective homomorphism, it is an isomorphism. Therefore, $A \\times B$ is isomorphic to $B \\times A$, as required.",

A subgroup of \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) under addition is a set of rational numbers that is closed under addition and taking inverses (negatives). This means if \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in \\(H\\), then \\(a + b\\) and \\(-a\\) are also in \\(H\\).\n\nNow, the problem states that for every nonzero element \\(x\\) in \\(H\\), the reciprocal \\(1/x\\) is also in \\(H\\). This is a rather strong condition because it implies that for any nonzero rational number in \\(H\\), its reciprocal is also in \\(H\\).\n\nLet's explore the implications of this condition:\n\n1. **Case 1: \\(H = \\{0\\}\\):** This is the trivial subgroup, containing only the zero element. In this case, the condition \\(1/x \\in H\\) is vacuously true because there are no nonzero elements in \\(H\\) to consider.\n\n2. **Case 2: \\(H \\neq \\{0\\}\\):** Suppose there exists a nonzero element \\(r/s \\in H\\) where \\(r\\) and \\(s\\) are integers with \\(s \\neq 0\\). By the given property, \\(s/r\\) must also be in \\(H\\). \n\n   - Now, consider the sum \\((r/s) + (s/r)\\). This equals \\((r^2 + s^2)/(rs)\\), which is also a rational number and must be in \\(H\\) because \\(H\\) is closed under addition.\n   - By repeatedly applying this process, we can generate more rational numbers in \\(H\\). Specifically, we can construct any rational number by appropriate combinations of \\(r/s\\) and \\(s/r\\).\n\n3. **Generating \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\):** If \\(H\\) contains any nonzero rational number, say \\(r/s\\), and its reciprocal \\(s/r\\), then by closure under addition and subtraction, \\(H\\) can be shown to contain all integer multiples of \\(r/s\\) and \\(s/r\\). This process can be extended to show that \\(H\\) must contain all rational numbers, effectively making \\(H = \\mathbb{Q}\\).\n\nThus, the subgroup \\(H\\) must either be the trivial subgroup \\(\\{0\\}\\) or the entire group \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\). There are no other possibilities because any nonzero element in \\(H\\) along with its reciprocal allows us to generate all rational numbers through the operations allowed in a subgroup.\n\nTherefore, the only subgroups of \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) satisfying the given condition are \\(H = \\{0\\}\\) or \\(H = \\mathbb{Q}\\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: type mismatch\n  hH ?m.2544\nhas type\n  1 / x\u271d \u2208 H : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  1 / x \u2208 H : Prop\nsimp made no progress\napplication type mismatch\n  hH h1\nargument\n  h1\nhas type\n  1 / x \u2208 H : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  x\u271d \u2208 H : Prop\nPlease revise the proof.",

Therefore, \\( H \\) can be generated by some power of \\( x \\), say \\( H = \\langle x^m \\rangle \\) for some integer \\( m \\).\n\nA subgroup \\( H \\) is maximal if there are no subgroups of \\( G \\) that contain \\( H \\) other than \\( G \\) itself. In other words, \\( H \\) is maximal if the only subgroup that properly contains \\( H \\) is \\( G \\).\n\nFor \\( H = \\langle x^m \\rangle \\) to be maximal, the order of \\( H \\) must be such that there are no other divisors of \\( n \\) between the order of \\( H \\) and \\( n \\). The order of \\( H \\) is \\( n/m \\), where \\( m \\) is the smallest positive integer such that \\( x^m \\) generates \\( H \\).\n\nNow, let's consider the condition \\( H = \\langle x^p \\rangle \\) for some prime \\( p \\) dividing \\( n \\). If \\( p \\) is a prime divisor of \\( n \\), then \\( n = kp \\) for some integer \\( k \\). The subgroup \\( \\langle x^p \\rangle \\) has order \\( n/p = k \\).\n\nFor \\( H \\) to be maximal, there should be no other divisors of \\( n \\) between \\( k \\) and \\( n \\). Since \\( p \\) is prime, the only divisors of \\( n \\) that could potentially create a subgroup between \\( H \\) and \\( G \\) are \\( 1 \\) and \\( p \\). Therefore, \\( \\langle x^p \\rangle \\) is maximal because the only subgroup larger than it is \\( G \\) itself.\n\nConversely, if \\( H \\) is maximal, then it must be of the form \\( \\langle x^p \\rangle \\) for some prime \\( p \\) dividing \\( n \\). This is because if \\( H \\) were generated by \\( x^m \\) where \\( m \\) is not a prime divisor of \\( n \\), there would exist another divisor of \\( n \\) between \\( m \\) and \\( n \\), contradicting the maximality of \\( H \\).\n\nThus, we have shown that a subgroup \\( H \\) of a cyclic group \\( G \\) of order \\( n \\) is maximal if and only if \\( H = \\langle x^p \\rangle \\) for some prime \\( p \\) dividing \\( n \\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

A subgroup $N$ of a group $G$ is normal if for every element $g$ in $G$ and every element $n$ in $N$, the element $gng^{-1}$ is also in $N$. This property ensures that the subgroup is invariant under conjugation by any element of the group.\n\nNow, consider the intersection $H \\cap K$.

This is because the intersection of subgroups is always a subgroup.\n\nNext, we need to show that $H \\cap K$ is normal in $G$. Take any element $g \\in G$ and any element $x \\in H \\cap K$. Since $x$ is in the intersection, it means $x$ is in both $H$ and $K$. Because $H$ is normal in $G$, we have $gxg^{-1} \\in H$. Similarly, because $K$ is normal in $G$, we have $gxg^{-1} \\in K$.

This group is denoted as \\((\\mathbb{Z} / p \\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}\\), which consists of all integers from 1 to \\( p-1 \\) that are coprime to \\( p \\). Since \\( p \\) is a prime, all these integers are indeed coprime to \\( p \\), making the group \\((\\mathbb{Z} / p \\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}\\) have exactly \\( p-1 \\) elements.\n\nNow, according to Lagrange's Theorem in group theory, the order (or size) of any subgroup of a finite group divides the order of the entire group. In our case, the entire group \\((\\mathbb{Z} / p \\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}\\) has order \\( p-1 \\).\n\nConsider any integer \\( a \\) that is not divisible by \\( p \\). This \\( a \\) is an element of our group \\((\\mathbb{Z} / p \\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}\\).

We can rewrite this as:\n\\[ a^p \\equiv a \\pmod{p} \\]\nwhich simplifies to:\n\\[ a^p - a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}. \\]\n\nThis can be factored as:\n\\[ a(a^{p-1} - 1) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}. \\]\n\nSince \\( a^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p} \\) for \\( a \\) not divisible by \\( p \\), the term \\( a^{p-1} - 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p} \\).

The index of \\( H \\) in \\( G \\), denoted \\( [G : H] \\), is the number of distinct cosets of \\( H \\) in \\( G \\). If this index is a prime number \\( p \\), it means there are exactly \\( p \\) distinct cosets.\n\n2. **Subgroup \\( K \\) and its Relationship with \\( H \\)**: Consider any subgroup \\( K \\) of \\( G \\). We need to explore two possibilities:\n   - **Case 1**: \\( K \\leq H \\). This is straightforward; if \\( K \\) is contained in \\( H \\), then the condition is satisfied trivially.\n   - **Case 2**: \\( K \\not\\leq H \\). Here, we need to show that \\( G = HK \\) and \\( |K : K \\cap H| = p \\).\n\n3. **Exploring \\( K \\not\\leq H \\)**: If \\( K \\) is not contained in \\( H \\), there exists an element \\( k \\in K \\) such that \\( k \\notin H \\). Since \\( H \\) is normal and has index \\( p \\), the cosets of \\( H \\) partition \\( G \\) into \\( p \\) distinct parts. The subgroup \\( K \\) must interact with these cosets in a way that covers all of \\( G \\).\n\n4. **Coset Interaction and Product \\( G = HK \\)**: Since \\( k \\notin H \\), the coset \\( kH \\) is different from \\( H \\). The subgroup \\( K \\) will generate new cosets when combined with \\( H \\), and because \\( H \\) has index \\( p \\), the combination of \\( H \\) and \\( K \\) must cover all of \\( G \\). Thus, \\( G = HK \\).\n\n5. **Index Condition \\( |K : K \\cap H| = p \\)**: The subgroup \\( K \\cap H \\) is the intersection of \\( K \\) and \\( H \\). The index \\( |K : K \\cap H| \\) represents how many distinct cosets of \\( K \\cap H \\) are needed to cover \\( K \\). Since \\( G = HK \\) and \\( H \\) has index \\( p \\), the number of such cosets must also be \\( p \\).\n\nIn summary, if \\( H \\) is a normal subgroup of \\( G \\) with prime index \\( p \\), then for any subgroup \\( K \\) of \\( G \\), either \\( K \\) is contained in \\( H \\), or \\( G \\) can be expressed as the product \\( HK \\) with the index \\( |K : K \\cap H| = p \\).

        "informal_proof": "# Informal Proof:\n\nTo prove that every subgroup of index \\( p \\) is normal in a group \\( G \\) of order \\( p^\\alpha \\), where \\( p \\) is a prime, we can use some insights from group theory and the properties of cosets.\n\nFirst, let's recall what it means for a subgroup \\( H \\) to be normal in \\( G \\). A subgroup \\( H \\) is normal if for every element \\( g \\) in \\( G \\), the left coset \\( gH \\) is equal to the right coset \\( Hg \\). In other words, the subgroup \\( H \\) is invariant under conjugation by any element of \\( G \\).\n\nNow, consider the group \\( G \\) of order \\( p^\\alpha \\). By Lagrange's Theorem, the order of any subgroup \\( H \\) of \\( G \\) must divide the order of \\( G \\). If \\( H \\) is a subgroup of index \\( p \\), this means that the number of distinct left cosets of \\( H \\) in \\( G \\) is \\( p \\). Consequently, the order of \\( H \\) is \\( \\frac{|G|}{p} = p^{\\alpha - 1} \\).\n\nThe key idea here is to use the fact that \\( p \\) is the smallest prime dividing the order of \\( G \\). This property is crucial because it implies that any subgroup of index \\( p \\) is a maximal subgroup. In group theory, a maximal subgroup is one that is not properly contained in any other proper subgroup of the group.\n\nNow, let's consider the action of \\( G \\) on the set of left cosets of \\( H \\) by left multiplication. This action induces a homomorphism from \\( G \\) to the symmetric group on \\( p \\) elements, \\( S_p \\). The kernel of this homomorphism is a normal subgroup of \\( G \\) and is contained in \\( H \\). Since \\( H \\) is a maximal subgroup, the kernel must be either \\( H \\) itself or the whole group \\( G \\).\n\nIf the kernel were the whole group \\( G \\), then the homomorphism would be trivial, implying that \\( G \\) acts trivially on the cosets, which is not possible unless \\( G = H \\), contradicting the fact that \\( H \\) is a proper subgroup. Therefore, the kernel must be \\( H \\), meaning that \\( H \\) is normal in \\( G \\).\n\nThus, every subgroup of index \\( p \\) in a group of order \\( p^\\alpha \\) is normal, as required. This conclusion aligns with the general principle that subgroups of index equal to the smallest prime divisor of the group's order are normal, as seen in the context of the subgroup of index 2 being normal.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  Fintype \u21a5H\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  card (?m.5015 \u29f8 ?H)\nG : Type u_1\ninst\u271d\u00b9 : Fintype G\ninst\u271d : Group G\np \u03b1 : \u2115\nhp : p.Prime\nha : \u03b1 > 0\nhG : card G = p ^ \u03b1\nH : Subgroup G\nhH : H.index = p\nthis\u271d : Fintype G\nthis : Fintype \u21a5H\n\u22a2 H.Normal\nPlease revise the proof.",

By Sylow's theorems, \\( G \\) has a Sylow \\( p \\)-subgroup \\( P \\) of order \\( p \\) and a Sylow \\( q \\)-subgroup \\( Q \\) of order \\( q \\). Since \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) are distinct primes, these subgroups are unique and hence normal in \\( G \\).\n\nNow, because \\( G \\) is abelian, every subgroup of \\( G \\) is normal. This means that \\( P \\) and \\( Q \\) are not only normal but also central in \\( G \\). Therefore, the intersection of \\( P \\) and \\( Q \\) is trivial, i.e., \\( P \\cap Q = \\{ e \\} \\), where \\( e \\) is the identity element of \\( G \\).\n\nThe elements of \\( P \\) and \\( Q \\) together form a set of \\( p + q - 1 \\) elements (excluding the identity element counted twice). However, the total number of elements in \\( G \\) is \\( pq \\), which is greater than \\( p + q - 1 \\). This implies that there must be an element in \\( G \\) that is not in \\( P \\cup Q \\).\n\nConsider an element \\( g \\) in \\( G \\) that is not in \\( P \\cup Q \\). The order of \\( g \\) must divide the order of \\( G \\), which is \\( pq \\). Since \\( g \\) is not in \\( P \\) or \\( Q \\), its order cannot be \\( p \\) or \\( q \\). Therefore, the order of \\( g \\) must be \\( pq \\).\n\nAn element of order \\( pq \\) generates a cyclic group of order \\( pq \\), which is the entire group \\( G \\). Thus, \\( G \\) is cyclic, as it can be generated by a single element of order \\( pq \\).\n\nIn conclusion, the structure of the abelian group \\( G \\), combined with the properties of its Sylow subgroups, ensures that \\( G \\) is cyclic.\nPrevious attempt failed with: expected ';' or line break\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

A normal subgroup \\( N \\) of a group \\( G \\) is one where every element of \\( G \\) conjugates \\( N \\) to itself. In other words, for every element \\( g \\) in \\( G \\), the set \\( gNg^{-1} \\) is equal to \\( N \\). On the other hand, a characteristic subgroup \\( H \\) of \\( G \\) is one that is invariant under all automorphisms of \\( G \\). This means that any automorphism of \\( G \\) maps \\( H \\) to itself.\n\nNow, let's find an example where a subgroup is normal but not characteristic. Consider the symmetric group \\( S_3 \\), which is the group of all permutations of three elements. The group \\( S_3 \\) has a normal subgroup \\( A_3 \\), which is the alternating group on three elements. The subgroup \\( A_3 \\) consists of the identity permutation and the two 3-cycles, which are even permutations.\n\n\\( A_3 \\) is normal in \\( S_3 \\) because for any permutation \\( \\sigma \\) in \\( S_3 \\), conjugating any element of \\( A_3 \\) by \\( \\sigma \\) results in another element of \\( A_3 \\). This is due to the fact that conjugation by any element of \\( S_3 \\) simply permutes the elements of the cycle, which remains an even permutation.\n\nHowever, \\( A_3 \\) is not characteristic in \\( S_3 \\). To see why, consider an automorphism of \\( S_3 \\) that swaps two transpositions, say \\( (1\\ 2) \\) and \\( (1\\ 3) \\). This automorphism does not map \\( A_3 \\) to itself because it can map elements outside of \\( A_3 \\) into \\( A_3 \\) and vice versa. Since \\( A_3 \\) is not invariant under all automorphisms of \\( S_3 \\), it is not a characteristic subgroup.\n\nThus, \\( A_3 \\) in \\( S_3 \\) serves as an example of a normal subgroup that is not characteristic, demonstrating that such subgroups do indeed exist.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'let'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

A subgroup \\( H \\) is characteristic in \\( K \\) if every automorphism of \\( K \\) maps \\( H \\) to itself. In simpler terms, no matter how you \"rearrange\" \\( K \\) using its internal symmetries (automorphisms), \\( H \\) remains unchanged.\n\nNext, a subgroup \\( K \\) is normal in \\( G \\) if for every element \\( g \\) in \\( G \\), the conjugate \\( gKg^{-1} \\) is equal to \\( K \\). This means that \\( K \\) is invariant under conjugation by any element of \\( G \\).\n\nNow, let's see how these properties help us prove that \\( H \\) is normal in \\( G \\).\n\n1. **Conjugation as an Automorphism**: Since \\( K \\) is normal in \\( G \\), for any element \\( g \\) in \\( G \\), the map that sends each element \\( k \\) in \\( K \\) to \\( gkg^{-1} \\) is an automorphism of \\( K \\).

The order of the group, 56, can be factored as \\( 56 = 2^3 \\times 7 \\). This tells us that the possible Sylow subgroups are Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 7-subgroups.\n\nAccording to the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow \\( p \\)-subgroups, denoted \\( n_p \\), must satisfy two conditions:\n1. \\( n_p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p} \\) (i.e., \\( n_p \\) is congruent to 1 modulo \\( p \\)).\n2. \\( n_p \\) divides the order of the group.\n\nLet's apply these conditions to our group:\n\n1. **Sylow 2-subgroups:**\n   - \\( n_2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2} \\), meaning \\( n_2 \\) is odd.\n   - \\( n_2 \\) must divide 56. The divisors of 56 are 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 14, 28, and 56. Among these, the odd divisors are 1 and 7.\n   - Therefore, \\( n_2 \\) can be either 1 or 7.\n\n2. **Sylow 7-subgroups:**\n   - \\( n_7 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7} \\), meaning \\( n_7 \\) is congruent to 1 modulo 7.\n   - \\( n_7 \\) must divide 56. The divisors of 56 are 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 14, 28, and 56. Among these, the numbers that are congruent to 1 modulo 7 are 1 and 8.\n   - Therefore, \\( n_7 \\) can be either 1 or 8.\n\nNow, we need to show that at least one of these numbers, \\( n_2 \\) or \\( n_7 \\), is 1, which would imply the corresponding Sylow subgroup is normal.\n\n- If \\( n_2 = 1 \\), then there is exactly one Sylow 2-subgroup, and it is normal by definition.\n- If \\( n_7 = 1 \\), then there is exactly one Sylow 7-subgroup, and it is normal by definition.\n\nSuppose neither \\( n_2 = 1 \\) nor \\( n_7 = 1 \\). This would mean \\( n_2 = 7 \\) and \\( n_7 = 8 \\).\n\n- If \\( n_7 = 8 \\), then there are 8 distinct Sylow 7-subgroups. Each Sylow 7-subgroup has 6 non-identity elements (since a Sylow 7-subgroup is of order 7, and the identity element is not counted). Thus, these 8 subgroups contribute \\( 8 \\times 6 = 48 \\) distinct elements to the group.\n- The group has 56 elements in total, so there are \\( 56 - 48 = 8 \\) elements left to account for.\n- A Sylow 2-subgroup has order 8, which means it can account for all these remaining 8 elements.\n\nThus, if \\( n_7 = 8 \\), then \\( n_2 \\) must be 1, making the Sylow 2-subgroup normal. Therefore, it is impossible for both \\( n_2 \\) and \\( n_7 \\) to be greater than 1 simultaneously.\n\nIn conclusion, a group of order 56 must have a normal Sylow \\( p \\)-subgroup for some prime \\( p \\) dividing its order, either a normal Sylow 2-subgroup or a normal Sylow 7-subgroup.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown constant 'Sylow.card_modEq_one_of_p_group'\nunknown constant

The order of the group, 351, can be factored into prime numbers as $351 = 3 \\times 3 \\times 13 = 3^2 \\times 13$. This tells us that the group has Sylow subgroups corresponding to the primes 3 and 13.\n\nAccording to Sylow's theorems, the number of Sylow $p$-subgroups, denoted $n_p$, must satisfy two conditions:\n1. $n_p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$, meaning $n_p$ is congruent to 1 modulo $p$.\n2. $n_p$ divides the order of the group, which is 351 in this case.\n\nLet's apply these conditions to each prime factor:\n\n1. **For $p = 3$:**\n   - $n_3 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$, so $n_3$ could be 1, 4, 7, 10, etc.\n   - $n_3$ must also divide 351. The divisors of 351 are 1, 3, 9, 13, 27, 39, 117, and 351.\n   - Among these divisors, the only one that satisfies both conditions is $n_3 = 1$.\n\n   If $n_3 = 1$, then there is exactly one Sylow 3-subgroup, and by Sylow's theorems, this subgroup must be normal in the group.\n\n2. **For $p = 13$:**\n   - $n_{13} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{13}$, so $n_{13}$ could be 1, 14, 27, etc.\n   - $n_{13}$ must also divide 351.

Since we found that $n_3 = 1$ and $n_{13} = 1$, both Sylow subgroups are normal. Therefore, the group has a normal Sylow $p$-subgroup for some prime $p$ dividing its order, specifically for both $p = 3$ and $p = 13$.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

Let's break down the reasoning step by step.\n\nFirst, we note that the order of the group \\( G \\) is 105, which factors as \\( 105 = 3 \\times 5 \\times 7 \\). According to Sylow's theorems, \\( G \\) must have Sylow subgroups corresponding to each of these prime factors: a Sylow 3-subgroup, a Sylow 5-subgroup, and a Sylow 7-subgroup.\n\nThe number of Sylow \\( p \\)-subgroups, denoted \\( n_p \\), must satisfy two conditions:\n1. \\( n_p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p} \\) (it must be congruent to 1 modulo \\( p \\)).\n2. \\( n_p \\) must divide the order of the group, which is 105.\n\nLet's apply these conditions to the Sylow 5-subgroups and Sylow 7-subgroups:\n\n- For Sylow 5-subgroups:\n  - \\( n_5 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5} \\) means \\( n_5 \\) could be 1, 6, 11, 16, etc.\n  - \\( n_5 \\) must divide 105. The divisors of 105 are 1, 3, 5, 7, 15, 21, 35, and 105.\n  - The only value that satisfies both conditions is \\( n_5 = 1 \\) or \\( n_5 = 21 \\).\n\n- For Sylow 7-subgroups:\n  - \\( n_7 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7} \\) means \\( n_7 \\) could be 1, 8, 15, 22, etc.\n  - \\( n_7 \\) must divide 105. The divisors of 105 are the same as above.\n  - The only value that satisfies both conditions is \\( n_7 = 1 \\) or \\( n_7 = 15 \\).\n\nNow, if either \\( n_5 = 1 \\) or \\( n_7 = 1 \\), the corresponding Sylow subgroup is unique and hence normal in \\( G \\). So, we need to show that it is impossible for both \\( n_5 = 21 \\) and \\( n_7 = 15 \\) to occur simultaneously.\n\nSuppose \\( n_7 = 15 \\). Each Sylow 7-subgroup has 6 elements (since a Sylow 7-subgroup is of order 7), and they are distinct except for the identity element. Thus, these 15 subgroups contribute \\( 6 \\times 15 = 90 \\) distinct elements to \\( G \\).\n\nThis leaves only 15 elements in \\( G \\) that are not part of any Sylow 7-subgroup. Now, suppose \\( n_5 = 21 \\). Each Sylow 5-subgroup has 4 elements (since a Sylow 5-subgroup is of order 5), and they are distinct except for the identity element. Thus, these 21 subgroups contribute \\( 4 \\times 21 = 84 \\) distinct elements to \\( G \\).\n\nHowever, we only have 15 elements left after accounting for the Sylow 7-subgroups, which is not enough to accommodate 84 elements from the Sylow 5-subgroups. This contradiction shows that it is impossible for both \\( n_5 = 21 \\) and \\( n_7 = 15 \\) to be true simultaneously.\n\nTherefore, either \\( n_5 = 1 \\) or \\( n_7 = 1 \\), meaning \\( G \\) must have a normal Sylow 5-subgroup or a normal Sylow 7-subgroup.

Since \\( P \\) is a \\( p \\)-subgroup, \\( P \\cap H \\) is also a \\( p \\)-subgroup.\n\n4. **Order of \\( P \\cap H \\)**: The order of \\( P \\cap H \\) is a power of \\( p \\), say \\( p^k \\), where \\( k \\leq n \\) and \\( n \\) is the power of \\( p \\) in the order of \\( P \\).\n\n5. **Maximality in \\( H \\)**: We need to show that \\( P \\cap H \\) is a Sylow \\( p \\)-subgroup of \\( H \\). Suppose there is another \\( p \\)-subgroup \\( Q \\) of \\( H \\) with order greater than \\( P \\cap H \\). Then \\( Q \\) would also be a \\( p \\)-subgroup of \\( G \\), and by the maximality of \\( P \\) as a Sylow \\( p \\)-subgroup of \\( G \\), \\( Q \\) must be contained in \\( P \\). This implies \\( Q \\subseteq P \\cap H \\), contradicting the assumption that \\( Q \\) has a greater order than \\( P \\cap H \\).\n\n6. **Uniqueness**: Since \\( P \\) is normal in \\( G \\), any Sylow \\( p \\)-subgroup of \\( H \\) that is conjugate to \\( P \\cap H \\) must actually be equal to \\( P \\cap H \\). This is because conjugation by elements of \\( G \\) does not change \\( P \\), and thus \\( P \\cap H \\) is invariant under conjugation by elements of \\( H \\).\n\nTherefore, \\( P \\cap H \\) is not only a Sylow \\( p \\)-subgroup of \\( H \\), but it is also the unique one, as any other Sylow \\( p \\)-subgroup of \\( H \\) would have to be conjugate to it and hence equal to it.

A field is a set equipped with two operations, addition and multiplication, that satisfy certain properties. Importantly, a field is a commutative ring with no proper zero divisors. This means that if the product of two elements in the field is zero, then at least one of those elements must be zero.\n\nNow, let's consider what a subring is. A subring is a subset of a ring that is itself a ring with the same operations. For a subring to be an integral domain, it must be a commutative ring with no zero divisors and must have a multiplicative identity (which is the same as the identity of the larger ring, in this case, the field).\n\nGiven that a field has no proper zero divisors, any subring of a field that includes the identity element will inherit this property. This is because the absence of zero divisors is a property that is preserved under taking subrings. If you have two elements in the subring whose product is zero, then at least one of them must be zero, just as in the larger field.\n\nAdditionally, since the subring contains the identity element of the field, it also has a multiplicative identity, which is a requirement for being an integral domain.\n\nTherefore, any subring of a field that contains the identity element is a commutative ring with no zero divisors and has a multiplicative identity. These are precisely the conditions needed for the subring to be an integral domain.\n\nIn summary, the properties of fields ensure that any subring containing the identity will automatically satisfy the conditions of being an integral domain: it is commutative, has no zero divisors, and includes the multiplicative identity.

An element \\(a\\) in a ring is nilpotent if there exists some positive integer \\(n\\) such that \\(a^n = 0\\).

We want to find an element \\(x\\) in the ring such that \\((1 - ab)x = 1\\). A useful approach is to consider the series expansion similar to a geometric series. Since \\(a\\) is nilpotent, we know that powers of \\(a\\) will eventually become zero, which suggests that a finite sum might work.\n\nLet's construct the element \\(x\\) as follows:\n\\[ x = 1 + ab + (ab)^2 + \\cdots + (ab)^{n-1} \\]\nwhere \\(n\\) is the smallest positive integer such that \\(a^n = 0\\).\n\nNow, let's verify that this choice of \\(x\\) works:\n\\[\n(1 - ab)x = (1 - ab)(1 + ab + (ab)^2 + \\cdots + (ab)^{n-1})\n\\]\n\nExpanding this product, we get:\n\\[\n= 1 \\cdot (1 + ab + (ab)^2 + \\cdots + (ab)^{n-1}) - ab \\cdot (1 + ab + (ab)^2 + \\cdots + (ab)^{n-1})\n\\]\n\nThe first part simplifies to:\n\\[\n1 + ab + (ab)^2 + \\cdots + (ab)^{n-1}\n\\]\n\nThe second part, when expanded, is:\n\\[\nab + (ab)^2 + (ab)^3 + \\cdots + (ab)^n\n\\]\n\nNotice that the terms \\(ab, (ab)^2, \\ldots, (ab)^{n-1}\\) in the first part will cancel with the corresponding terms in the second part, leaving us with:\n\\[\n1 - (ab)^n\n\\]\n\nSince \\(a^n = 0\\), it follows that \\((ab)^n = a^n b^n = 0\\), because any power of a nilpotent element multiplied by any element in the ring is still zero.

This condition is crucial because it implies that the ideal generated by \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), denoted \\( \\langle a, b \\rangle \\), is actually generated by their GCD. In other words, \\( \\langle a, b \\rangle = \\langle \\gcd(a, b) \\rangle \\). This is a key property of PIDs, where every ideal generated by two elements can be reduced to an ideal generated by a single element.\n\nNow, let's consider the second condition: if we have a sequence of nonzero elements \\( a_1, a_2, a_3, \\ldots \\) in \\( R \\) such that each element divides the previous one (\\( a_{i+1} \\mid a_i \\)), then there exists a positive integer \\( N \\) such that for all \\( n \\geq N \\), \\( a_n \\) is a unit times \\( a_N \\). This condition ensures that any descending chain of ideals in \\( R \\) stabilizes, meaning it eventually becomes constant. This is known as the \"ascending chain condition\" on ideals, which is a characteristic property of Noetherian rings. In a PID, every ideal is finitely generated, and this condition guarantees that the process of generating ideals does not go on indefinitely.\n\nCombining these two conditions, we can argue that any ideal in \\( R \\) can be generated by a single element. The first condition ensures that any ideal generated by two elements can be reduced to one generated by their GCD, and the second condition ensures that any sequence of ideals stabilizes, preventing infinite generation. Therefore, every ideal in \\( R \\) is principal, satisfying the definition of a Principal Ideal Domain.\n\nIn summary, the first condition provides a way to express GCDs as linear combinations, which is a hallmark of PIDs, while the second condition ensures that the structure of \\( R \\) does not allow for infinitely descending chains of ideals, reinforcing the principal nature of ideals in \\( R \\).

        "informal_proof": "# Informal Proof:\n\nTo prove that the quotient ring $\\mathbb{Z}[i] /(q)$ is a field with $q^2$ elements, where $q$ is a prime number such that $q \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$, we need to understand a few key concepts and apply them to this specific situation.\n\nFirst, let's consider the ring $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$, which is the ring of Gaussian integers. Gaussian integers are complex numbers of the form $a + bi$, where $a$ and $b$ are integers, and $i$ is the imaginary unit with $i^2 = -1$. The ring $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$ is a Euclidean domain, which means it has properties similar to the integers, such as the existence of a division algorithm.\n\nNow, when we talk about the quotient ring $\\mathbb{Z}[i] /(q)$, we are considering the set of equivalence classes of Gaussian integers modulo the ideal generated by $q$. This ideal, denoted by $(q)$, consists of all Gaussian integers of the form $q(a + bi)$, where $a$ and $b$ are integers.\n\nFor $\\mathbb{Z}[i] /(q)$ to be a field, the ideal $(q)$ must be maximal. In a Euclidean domain, an ideal is maximal if and only if it is generated by an irreducible element. An element in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$ is irreducible if it cannot be factored into two non-unit elements.\n\nThe condition $q \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$ is crucial here. It is a known result in number theory that a prime $q$ of the form $4k + 3$ remains irreducible in the ring of Gaussian integers $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$. This is because such primes cannot be expressed as a sum of two squares, which is a necessary condition for a prime to factor in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$.\n\nSince $q$ is irreducible in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$, the ideal $(q)$ is maximal. Therefore, the quotient ring $\\mathbb{Z}[i] /(q)$ is indeed a field.\n\nFinally, let's determine the number of elements in this field. The ring $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$ can be thought of as a two-dimensional lattice over $\\mathbb{Z}$, with basis $1$ and $i$. When we take the quotient by the ideal $(q)$, we are essentially considering the lattice points modulo $q$. This results in a grid of $q \\times q$ points, corresponding to the pairs $(a, b)$ where $0 \\leq a, b < q$. Thus, the number of elements in the field $\\mathbb{Z}[i] /(q)$ is $q^2$.\n\nIn summary, because $q \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$ ensures that $q$ is irreducible in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$, the quotient ring $\\mathbb{Z}[i] /(q)$ is a field, and it contains $q^2$ elements due to the structure of the Gaussian integers modulo $q$.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

This is the ring of polynomials with integer coefficients in infinitely many variables $x_1, x_2, x_3, \\ldots$. The ideal $(x_1 x_2, x_3 x_4, x_5 x_6, \\ldots)$ is generated by the products of pairs of consecutive variables: $x_1 x_2$, $x_3 x_4$, $x_5 x_6$, and so on. This means that in the quotient ring, each of these products is equivalent to zero.\n\nNow, consider the nature of prime ideals in this context. A prime ideal in a ring is an ideal such that if a product of two elements is in the ideal, then at least one of those elements must be in the ideal. A minimal prime ideal is a prime ideal that does not properly contain any other prime ideal.\n\nIn the quotient ring, each pair $x_{2k-1} x_{2k}$ is zero, which means that either $x_{2k-1}$ or $x_{2k}$ must be zero in any prime ideal containing this product. This gives us a choice for each pair: we can choose to include either $x_{2k-1}$ or $x_{2k}$ in the prime ideal, but not both, to maintain the minimality of the prime ideal.\n\nSince there are infinitely many such pairs, and for each pair, we have two choices (either include the first variable or the second), we can construct infinitely many distinct minimal prime ideals. Each choice corresponds to a different minimal prime ideal because choosing different variables to include in the ideal results in different sets of generators for the ideal.\n\nTherefore, the ring $\\mathbb{Z}[x_1, x_2, x_3, \\ldots] / (x_1 x_2, x_3 x_4, x_5 x_6, \\ldots)$ indeed contains infinitely many minimal prime ideals, as there are infinitely many ways to make these choices across the infinite set of variable pairs.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

The space $\\mathbb{R}^n$ consists of all $n$-tuples of real numbers, and it is a vector space over $\\mathbb{Q}$ with the usual addition and scalar multiplication defined component-wise. Similarly, $\\mathbb{R}$ is the set of all real numbers, also considered as a vector space over $\\mathbb{Q}$ with standard addition and scalar multiplication.\n\nThe key idea here is to recognize that both $\\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\\mathbb{R}$ have the same dimension when considered as vector spaces over $\\mathbb{Q}$.

        "informal_proof": "# Informal Proof:\n\nTo understand why the union of a family of topologies on a set $X$ does not necessarily form a topology, let's first recall what a topology is. A topology on a set $X$ is a collection of subsets of $X$ that includes the empty set and $X$ itself, is closed under arbitrary unions, and is closed under finite intersections.\n\nNow, consider a family of topologies $\\mathcal{T}_\\alpha$ on $X$. Each $\\mathcal{T}_\\alpha$ is a topology, meaning it satisfies the conditions mentioned above. However, when we take the union of all these topologies, denoted as $\\bigcup \\mathcal{T}_\\alpha$, we are simply collecting all the open sets from each topology into one large set. This new collection might not satisfy the conditions required to be a topology.\n\nThe key issue arises with the closure properties. Specifically, while each individual topology $\\mathcal{T}_\\alpha$ is closed under arbitrary unions and finite intersections, the union $\\bigcup \\mathcal{T}_\\alpha$ might not be. For example, consider two topologies $\\tau_1$ and $\\tau_2$ on a set $S = \\{0, 1, 2\\}$:\n\n- $\\tau_1 = \\{\\emptyset, \\{0\\}, \\{1\\}, \\{0, 1\\}, S\\}$\n- $\\tau_2 = \\{\\emptyset, \\{0\\}, \\{2\\}, \\{0, 2\\}, S\\}$\n\nThe union $\\tau_1 \\cup \\tau_2$ would be $\\{\\emptyset, \\{0\\}, \\{1\\}, \\{2\\}, \\{0, 1\\}, \\{0, 2\\}, S\\}$. Notice that the set $\\{1, 2\\}$, which is the union of $\\{1\\}$ and $\\{2\\}$, is not in $\\tau_1 \\cup \\tau_2$. This violates the requirement that a topology must be closed under arbitrary unions. Therefore, $\\tau_1 \\cup \\tau_2$ is not a topology.\n\nThis example illustrates that while each topology in the family $\\mathcal{T}_\\alpha$ is individually well-behaved, their union might not preserve the necessary properties to be a topology. Thus, the union of a family of topologies on $X$ does not necessarily form a topology on $X$.\nPrevious attempt failed with: type mismatch\n  \u2115\nhas type\n  Type : Type 1\nbut is expected to have type\n  Type u_1 : Type (u_1 + 1)\ntype mismatch\n  \u2115\nhas type\n  Type : Type 1\nbut is expected to have type\n  Type u_2 : Type (u_2 + 1)\ntactic 'split_ifs' failed, no if-then-else conditions to split\ncase h.left\ni : sorryAx (Type u_2) true\n\u22a2 is_topology (sorryAx (Type u_1) true) (sorryAx (Set (Set (sorryAx (Type u_1) true))) true)\nPlease revise the proof.",

This is essentially about finding the greatest lower bound (or infimum) of a collection of topologies on \\( X \\).\n\nFirst, let's recall what a topology on a set is. A topology on \\( X \\) is a collection of subsets of \\( X \\) that includes the empty set and \\( X \\) itself, and is closed under arbitrary unions and finite intersections. \n\nNow, consider the family of topologies \\(\\{\\mathcal{T}_\\alpha\\}\\) on \\( X \\).

Then every set in \\(\\mathcal{T}'\\) is in each \\(\\mathcal{T}_\\alpha\\), so it must also be in \\(\\mathcal{T}\\). Therefore, \\(\\mathcal{T}' \\subseteq \\mathcal{T}\\).\n\nThus, \\(\\mathcal{T} = \\bigcap_\\alpha \\mathcal{T}_\\alpha\\) is the unique largest topology on \\( X \\) that is contained in all the topologies \\(\\mathcal{T}_\\alpha\\).

This generated topology, often denoted as $\\tau(\\mathcal{A})$, is constructed by taking all possible unions of finite intersections of sets from $\\mathcal{A}$. \n\nNow, consider any topology $\\tau$ on $X$ that contains $\\mathcal{A}$. By definition, $\\tau$ must include all sets in $\\mathcal{A}$, and since topologies are closed under finite intersections and arbitrary unions, $\\tau$ must also include all finite intersections of sets from $\\mathcal{A}$, as well as any unions of these intersections. Therefore, $\\tau$ must contain every set in the topology $\\tau(\\mathcal{A})$ generated by $\\mathcal{A}$.\n\nNext, let's consider the intersection of all such topologies on $X$ that contain $\\mathcal{A}$. This intersection, by definition, is the largest collection of sets that is common to all these topologies. Since each of these topologies contains $\\tau(\\mathcal{A})$, the intersection must also contain $\\tau(\\mathcal{A})$. \n\nConversely, $\\tau(\\mathcal{A})$ is itself a topology on $X$ that contains $\\mathcal{A}$, because it is specifically constructed to be the smallest such topology. Therefore, $\\tau(\\mathcal{A})$ is one of the topologies being intersected, and thus it cannot be larger than the intersection of all topologies containing $\\mathcal{A}$.\n\nPutting these observations together, we see that $\\tau(\\mathcal{A})$ is both contained in and contains the intersection of all topologies on $X$ that include $\\mathcal{A}$. This means that $\\tau(\\mathcal{A})$ is exactly equal to this intersection.\n\nIn summary, the topology generated by a subbasis $\\mathcal{A}$ is precisely the intersection of all topologies on $X$ that contain $\\mathcal{A},$ because it is the smallest topology that can be formed from $\\mathcal{A}$, and it is contained in every topology that includes $\\mathcal{A}$.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

Every open interval in the standard topology on $\\mathbb{R}$ can be expressed as a union of these rational intervals.\n2. For any point in an open set in the standard topology, there exists a rational interval from our collection that contains this point and is entirely contained within the open set.\n\nLet's start with the first point. Consider any open interval $(c, d)$ in the standard topology on $\\mathbb{R}$. By the density of rational numbers in the real numbers, we know that between any two real numbers, there are rational numbers. Therefore, we can find rational numbers $a$ and $b$ such that $c < a < b < d$. The interval $(a, b)$ is a rational interval from our collection, and it is contained within $(c, d)$. By taking the union of all such rational intervals $(a, b)$, we can cover the entire interval $(c, d)$. Thus, every open interval in the standard topology can be expressed as a union of intervals from our collection.\n\nNow, for the second point, consider any open set $U$ in the standard topology and any point $x \\in U$. Since $U$ is open, there exists some open interval $(c, d)$ such that $x \\in (c, d) \\subseteq U$. Again, using the density of rational numbers, we can find rational numbers $a$ and $b$ such that $c < a < x < b < d$. The interval $(a, b)$ is a rational interval from our collection, and it contains the point $x$. Moreover, since $(a, b) \\subseteq (c, d) \\subseteq U$, the interval $(a, b)$ is entirely contained within $U$. \n\nTherefore, for any point in an open set, we can find a rational interval from our collection that contains the point and is contained within the open set. This satisfies the condition for our collection to be a basis for the standard topology on $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nIn conclusion, the collection $\\{(a, b) \\mid a < b, a \\text{ and } b \\text{ rational}\\}$ indeed forms a basis for the standard topology on $\\mathbb{R}$, as it allows us to express any open set in the standard topology as a union of these rational intervals.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'isTopologicalBasis_of_open_of_nhds'\nno goals to be solved\nPlease revise the proof.",

Now, $Y$ is a subspace of $X$, meaning $Y \\subseteq X$, and it inherits a subspace topology $\\tau_Y$ from $X$. This subspace topology $\\tau_Y$ consists of intersections of open sets in $X$ with $Y$. In other words, a set $U_Y$ is open in $Y$ if there exists an open set $U_X$ in $X$ such that $U_Y = U_X \\cap Y$.\n\nNow, consider $A \\subseteq Y$. We want to compare two topologies on $A$: one inherited from $Y$ and the other directly from $X$.\n\n1. **Topology on $A$ as a subspace of $Y$:**\n   - The subspace topology on $A$ from $Y$, denoted $\\tau_A^Y$, consists of sets of the form $V_A = U_Y \\cap A$, where $U_Y$ is open in $Y$. Since $U_Y$ is open in $Y$, there exists an open set $U_X$ in $X$ such that $U_Y = U_X \\cap Y$. Therefore, $V_A = (U_X \\cap Y) \\cap A$.\n\n2. **Topology on $A$ as a subspace of $X$:**\n   - The subspace topology on $A$ from $X$, denoted $\\tau_A^X$, consists of sets of the form $V_A = U_X \\cap A$, where $U_X$ is open in $X$.\n\nTo show these two topologies are the same, we need to show that any open set in $\\tau_A^Y$ is also in $\\tau_A^X$, and vice versa.\n\n- **From $\\tau_A^Y$ to $\\tau_A^X$:**\n  - Take any open set $V_A = (U_X \\cap Y) \\cap A$ in $\\tau_A^Y$. By the associative property of intersection, this can be rewritten as $V_A = U_X \\cap (Y \\cap A)$. Since $A \\subseteq Y$, $Y \\cap A = A$. Thus, $V_A = U_X \\cap A$, which is exactly the form of an open set in $\\tau_A^X$.\n\n- **From $\\tau_A^X$ to $\\tau_A^Y$:**\n  - Take any open set $V_A = U_X \\cap A$ in $\\tau_A^X$. Since $A \\subseteq Y$, we can express this as $V_A = U_X \\cap (Y \\cap A) = (U_X \\cap Y) \\cap A$. Here, $U_X \\cap Y$ is open in $Y$, so $V_A$ is in the form required for $\\tau_A^Y$.\n\nThus, every open set in $\\tau_A^Y$ is also in $\\tau_A^X$, and vice versa, proving that the two topologies are indeed the same. This shows that the topology $A$ inherits as a subspace of $Y$ is the same as the topology it inherits as a subspace of $X$.\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  And.intro hU\nargument\n  hU\nhas type\n  IsOpen U : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  IsOpen (Subtype.val '' ?m.616) : Prop\ninvalid projection, the expression\n  isOpen_induced_iff.mp hU\nis a proposition and has type\n  \u2203 t, IsOpen t \u2227 Subtype.val \u207b\u00b9' t = Subtype.val '' U\nbut the projected value is not, it has type\n  Set X\napplication type mismatch\n  Subtype.val '' U\nargument\n  U\nhas type\n  Set \u2191A : Type u_1\nbut is expected to have type\n  Set (Subtype (?m.1519 U hU)) : Type u_1\nPlease revise the proof.",

Each element of the collection is of the form \\((a, b) \\times (c, d)\\), which represents the set of all points \\((x, y)\\) such that \\(a < x < b\\) and \\(c < y < d\\).\n\n2. **Basis for the Topology**: To be a basis, for any open set \\(U\\) in \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\) and any point \\((x, y) \\in U\\), there must be a basis element \\((a, b) \\times (c, d)\\) such that \\((x, y) \\in (a, b) \\times (c, d) \\subseteq U\\).\n\n   - Given any open set \\(U\\) in \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\) and a point \\((x, y) \\in U\\), because \\(U\\) is open, there exists some open rectangle \\((p, q) \\times (r, s)\\) such that \\((x, y) \\in (p, q) \\times (r, s) \\subseteq U\\).\n\n   - Since the rational numbers are dense in the real numbers, we can find rational numbers \\(a, b, c, d\\) such that \\(p < a < x < b < q\\) and \\(r < c < y < d < s\\).\n\n   - Therefore, \\((x, y) \\in (a, b) \\times (c, d)\\) and \\((a, b) \\times (c, d) \\subseteq (p, q) \\times (r, s) \\subseteq U\\).\n\n3. **Conclusion for Basis**: This shows that for any open set \\(U\\) and any point \\((x, y) \\in U\\), there is a basis element from our collection that contains \\((x, y)\\) and is contained in \\(U\\). Thus, the collection is a basis for the topology on \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\).\n\n### Step 2: Show the collection is countable.\n\n1. **Countability of Rational Numbers**: The set of rational numbers \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) is countable.\n\n2. **Countability of Cartesian Product**: The Cartesian product of two countable sets is countable. Therefore, \\(\\mathbb{Q} \\times \\mathbb{Q}\\) is countable.\n\n3. **Countability of the Collection**: The collection is essentially the Cartesian product \\((\\mathbb{Q} \\times \\mathbb{Q}) \\times (\\mathbb{Q} \\times \\mathbb{Q})\\), which is countable because it is a product of countable sets.\n\n4. **Conclusion for Countability**: Since the collection is a countable union of countable sets, it is itself countable.\n\n### Final Conclusion:\n\nThe collection \\(\\{(a, b) \\times (c, d) \\mid a < b \\text{ and } c < d, \\text{ and } a, b, c, d \\text{ are rational}\\}\\) is a countable basis for the topology on \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\). This means it satisfies the requirements of being a basis (covering all open sets in \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\) with its elements) and is countable, as required.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unexpected token ','; expected '\u21a6', '=>'\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

In the order topology, a basic open set is typically an interval of the form \\((a, b)\\), \\((a, \\infty)\\), or \\((-\\infty, b)\\). This means that the topology is generated by open intervals, which are sets where elements are strictly between two endpoints.\n\nNow, consider the set \\(\\{x \\mid f(x) \\leq g(x)\\}\\). We want to show that this set is closed, which is equivalent to showing that its complement is open. The complement of this set is \\(\\{x \\mid f(x) > g(x)\\}\\).\n\nFor each point \\(x\\) in this complement, \\(f(x) > g(x)\\). Because \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) are continuous functions from \\(X\\) to \\(Y\\), the preimage of an open set under a continuous function is open. Therefore, for any point \\(x\\) where \\(f(x) > g(x)\\), there exists an open interval \\((g(x), f(x))\\) in \\(Y\\) such that \\(f(x)\\) is in this interval and \\(g(x)\\) is not.\n\nThe set \\(\\{x \\mid f(x) > g(x)\\}\\) can be expressed as the union of all such open intervals \\((g(x), f(x))\\) for each \\(x\\) in the complement. Since the preimage of each open interval under the continuous functions \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) is open in \\(X\\), the union of these preimages is also open in \\(X\\).\n\nThus, the complement \\(\\{x \\mid f(x) > g(x)\\}\\) is open in \\(X\\), which implies that the original set \\(\\{x \\mid f(x) \\leq g(x)\\}\\) is closed in \\(X\\).\n\nIn summary, by leveraging the continuity of \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) and the properties of the order topology on \\(Y\\), we have shown that the set where \\(f(x) \\leq g(x)\\) is indeed closed in \\(X\\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

Here, \\( Y \\) is a Hausdorff space, which means that any two distinct points in \\( Y \\) can be separated by neighborhoods.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Understanding the Extension**: The function \\( f \\) is defined on a subset \\( A \\) of a space \\( X \\), and we are considering its extension \\( g \\) to the closure of \\( A \\), denoted \\( \\bar{A} \\). The closure \\( \\bar{A} \\) includes all the limit points of \\( A \\), meaning it is the smallest closed set containing \\( A \\).\n\n2. **Continuity and Limits**: Since \\( f \\) is continuous, for any sequence \\( \\{a_n\\} \\) in \\( A \\) that converges to a point \\( a \\in \\bar{A} \\), the sequence \\( \\{f(a_n)\\} \\) should converge to \\( g(a) \\). This is because \\( g \\) must be continuous on \\( \\bar{A} \\), and continuity in a metric space implies that the image of a convergent sequence under a continuous function is also convergent.\n\n3. **Uniqueness in Hausdorff Spaces**: The key property of a Hausdorff space is that limits of sequences are unique. If two sequences \\( \\{a_n\\} \\) and \\( \\{b_n\\} \\) in \\( A \\) both converge to the same point \\( a \\in \\bar{A} \\), then the sequences \\( \\{f(a_n)\\} \\) and \\( \\{f(b_n)\\} \\) must both converge to the same point \\( g(a) \\) in \\( Y \\). This is because \\( Y \\) being Hausdorff ensures that a limit of a sequence, if it exists, is unique.\n\n4. **Constructing \\( g \\)**: For each point \\( a \\in \\bar{A} \\), we define \\( g(a) \\) as the limit of \\( f(a_n) \\) where \\( \\{a_n\\} \\) is any sequence in \\( A \\) converging to \\( a \\). The continuity of \\( f \\) and the completeness of \\( Y \\) (if applicable) ensure that this limit exists and is well-defined.\n\n5. **Ensuring Uniqueness**: Suppose there were two different extensions \\( g_1 \\) and \\( g_2 \\) of \\( f \\) to \\( \\bar{A} \\). For any \\( a \\in \\bar{A} \\), we would have sequences \\( \\{a_n\\} \\) in \\( A \\) converging to \\( a \\) such that both \\( g_1(a) \\) and \\( g_2(a) \\) are limits of \\( \\{f(a_n)\\} \\). However, since limits in a Hausdorff space are unique, \\( g_1(a) \\) must equal \\( g_2(a) \\) for all \\( a \\in \\bar{A} \\). Thus, \\( g_1 \\) and \\( g_2 \\) must be the same function.\n\nIn summary, the uniqueness of the extension \\( g \\) is guaranteed by the properties of continuity and the Hausdorff nature of \\( Y \\). The function \\( g \\) is uniquely determined by \\( f \\) because any two potential extensions must agree on the limits of sequences from \\( A \\), and these limits are unique in a Hausdorff space.\nPrevious attempt failed with: failed to synthesize\n  HSub Y Y ?m.4026\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  Sub Y\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  HSub Y Y ?m.7773\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nfailed to synthesize\n  HSub Y Y ?m.14225\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nsimp made no progress\nsimp made no progress\nPlease revise the proof.",

Consider \\(\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}\\) as pairs \\((x, y)\\) where \\(x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}\\). The dictionary order is similar to how words are ordered in a dictionary: we first compare the first elements of the pairs, and if they are equal, we compare the second elements. Formally, \\((x_1, y_1) < (x_2, y_2)\\) if either \\(x_1 < x_2\\) or \\(x_1 = x_2\\) and \\(y_1 < y_2\\).\n\nNow, for a space to be metrizable, it must have a topology that can be derived from a metric. A key property of metrizable spaces is that they are second-countable, meaning they have a countable basis. From the context, we know that the real number line \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) with the usual topology is second-countable because it has a countable basis consisting of open intervals with rational endpoints.\n\nTo construct a metric for \\(\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}\\) with the dictionary order topology, we can use the fact that \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) itself is metrizable with the standard Euclidean metric. We can define a metric on \\(\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}\\) that respects the dictionary order by considering a combination of the Euclidean metrics on each component. One such metric is:\n\n\\[ d((x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2)) = \\sqrt{(x_1 - x_2)^2 + (y_1 - y_2)^2} \\]\n\nHowever, this metric induces the product topology, not the dictionary order topology. To specifically address the dictionary order, we need a metric that reflects the order properties. A more suitable approach is to consider a metric that emphasizes the order of the first component and then the second, such as:\n\n\\[ d((x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2)) = \\begin{cases} \n|x_1 - x_2| & \\text{if } x_1 \\neq x_2 \\\\\n|y_1 - y_2| & \\text{if } x_1 = x_2 \n\\end{cases} \\]\n\nThis metric respects the dictionary order because it first measures the distance between the \\(x\\)-coordinates, and only if they are equal does it consider the \\(y\\)-coordinates. This ensures that the topology induced by this metric is the same as the dictionary order topology.\n\nFinally, since \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) is second-countable and the dictionary order on \\(\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}\\) can be described using open intervals with rational endpoints (similar to the basis for \\(\\mathbb{R}\\)), the space \\(\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}\\) with the dictionary order topology is also second-countable. This confirms that it is indeed metrizable, as second-countability is a necessary condition for metrizability.\n\nThus, \\(\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}\\) in the dictionary order topology is metrizable.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unexpected end of input\nPlease revise the proof.",

A sequence of functions \\((f_n)\\) converges uniformly to a function \\(f\\) on a set \\(S\\) if, for every \\(\\epsilon > 0\\), there exists an \\(N\\) such that for all \\(n \\geq N\\) and all \\(x \\in S\\), the inequality \\(|f_n(x) - f(x)| < \\epsilon\\) holds.\n\nLet's analyze the behavior of \\(f_n(x) = x^n\\) as \\(n\\) becomes very large. For \\(x = 1\\), we have \\(f_n(1) = 1^n = 1\\) for all \\(n\\). For \\(x = 0\\), we have \\(f_n(0) = 0^n = 0\\) for all \\(n\\). So, at the endpoints of the interval, the function values are constant.\n\nHowever, for \\(0 < x < 1\\), as \\(n\\) increases, \\(x^n\\) becomes very small because raising a number less than 1 to a large power results in a number that approaches 0. Therefore, for any \\(x\\) in the open interval \\((0, 1)\\), \\(f_n(x)\\) approaches 0 as \\(n\\) increases.\n\nThis suggests that the pointwise limit of \\(f_n(x)\\) as \\(n \\to \\infty\\) is a function \\(f(x)\\) defined by:\n- \\(f(x) = 0\\) for \\(0 \\leq x < 1\\),\n- \\(f(1) = 1\\).\n\nNow, let's consider uniform convergence. For uniform convergence to \\(f(x)\\), we would need \\(|f_n(x) - f(x)| < \\epsilon\\) for all \\(x \\in [0, 1]\\) and sufficiently large \\(n\\). However, notice that at \\(x = 1\\), \\(|f_n(1) - f(1)| = |1 - 1| = 0\\), which is fine. But for \\(x\\) close to 1, say \\(x = 1 - \\frac{1}{n}\\), we have:\n\\[ f_n\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{n}\\right) = \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{n}\\right)^n. \\]\n\nAs \\(n\\) becomes large, this expression approaches \\(e^{-1}\\), which is approximately 0.3679, not 0. Therefore, for any \\(\\epsilon < 0.3679\\), no matter how large \\(n\\) is, there will always be some \\(x\\) close to 1 for which \\(|f_n(x) - f(x)| \\geq \\epsilon\\).\n\nThis shows that we cannot make \\(|f_n(x) - f(x)|\\) uniformly small over the entire interval \\([0, 1]\\) for all \\(n\\) beyond some fixed \\(N\\). Thus, the sequence \\((f_n)\\) does not converge uniformly to \\(f\\) on \\([0, 1]\\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  f n x\nargument\n  x\nhas type\n  \u211d : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u2191I : Type\napplication type mismatch\n  f\u2080 x\nargument\n  x\nhas type\n  \u211d : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u2191I : Type\napplication type mismatch\n  hf x\nargument\n  x\nhas type\n  \u211d : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  Set (\u211d \u00d7 \u211d) : Type\napplication type mismatch\n  f\u2080 x\nargument\n  x\nhas type\n  \u211d : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u2191I : Type\napplication type mismatch\n  f n x\nargument\n  x\nhas type\n  \u211d : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u2191I : Type\napplication type mismatch\n  h x\nargument\n  x\nhas type\n  \u211d : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u2191I : Type\napplication type mismatch\n  f\u2080 x\nargument\n  x\nhas type\n  \u211d : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u2191I : Type\ntype mismatch\n  tendsto_const_nhds\nhas type\n  Tendsto (fun x => ?m.45254) ?m.45256 (\ud835\udcdd ?m.45254) : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  Tendsto (fun n => 1 ^ n) atTop (\ud835\udcdd 1) : Prop\napplication type mismatch\n  f\u2080 x\nargument\n  x\nhas type\n  \u211d : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u2191I : Type\napplication type mismatch\n  f\u2080 x\nargument\n  x\nhas type\n  \u211d : Type\nbut is expected to have type\n  \u2191I : Type\napplication type mismatch\n  h8 h7.right\nargument\n  h7.right\nhas type\n  x \u2264 1 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  x < 1 : Prop\ntactic 'contradiction' failed\ncase intro\nf : \u2115 \u2192 \u2191I \u2192 \u211d\nh : \u2200 (x : \u2191I) (n : \u2115), f n x = \u2191x ^ n\nf\u2080 : \u2191I \u2192 \u211d\nhf : TendstoUniformly f f\u2080 atTop\nh1 : \u2200 x \u2208 I, Tendsto (fun n => f n (sorryAx (\u2191I) true)) atTop (\ud835\udcdd (f\u2080 (sorryAx (\u2191I) true)))\nh2 : \u2200 x \u2208 I, f\u2080 (sorryAx (\u2191I) true) = 0\nh3 : f\u2080 1 = 1\nh4 : f\u2080 1 = 0\n\u22a2 False\nPlease revise the proof.",

A space is connected if it cannot be divided into two non-empty, disjoint open sets. Equivalently, in a topological space, the only clopen (both closed and open) sets are the entire space and the empty set.\n\nNow, consider the set \\( B = A \\cup \\left(\\bigcup A_{\\alpha}\\right) \\). We want to show that \\( B \\) is connected. We know that \\( A \\) is connected, and each \\( A_{\\alpha} \\) is connected. Moreover, each \\( A_{\\alpha} \\) intersects \\( A \\), meaning there is at least one point common to both \\( A \\) and \\( A_{\\alpha} \\).\n\nThe key idea here is that the intersection of each \\( A_{\\alpha} \\) with \\( A \\) ensures that there is no way to separate \\( A \\) from any \\( A_{\\alpha} \\) using disjoint open sets.

Since \\( A_{\\alpha} \\) is connected and intersects \\( A \\), it cannot be split between \\( U \\) and \\( V \\). Therefore, \\( A_{\\alpha} \\) must also be entirely contained in \\( U \\).\n\nThis reasoning applies to every \\( A_{\\alpha} \\), so the entire union \\(\\bigcup A_{\\alpha}\\) is contained in \\( U \\). Consequently, \\( B = A \\cup \\left(\\bigcup A_{\\alpha}\\right) \\subseteq U \\), which implies \\( V \\) must be empty, contradicting the assumption that \\( U \\) and \\( V \\) are both non-empty.\n\nThus, the assumption that \\( B \\) can be split into two non-empty, disjoint open sets is false, and therefore \\( B \\) is connected.

The boundary \\(\\operatorname{Bd} A\\) consists of all points that are in the closure of \\( A \\) and the closure of its complement \\( X - A \\). In other words, these are points that are \"on the edge\" of \\( A \\), neither entirely inside \\( A \\) nor entirely outside it.\n\nNow, consider the connected subspace \\( C \\). By definition, a connected space cannot be split into two disjoint non-empty open sets. This property is crucial for our argument.\n\nSince \\( C \\) intersects both \\( A \\) and \\( X - A \\), there are points in \\( C \\) that belong to \\( A \\) and points that belong to \\( X - A \\). If \\( C \\) did not intersect the boundary \\(\\operatorname{Bd} A\\), then we could separate \\( C \\) into two disjoint open sets: one containing the points in \\( C \\cap A \\) and the other containing the points in \\( C \\cap (X - A) \\). This would contradict the connectedness of \\( C \\).\n\nTo see why, note that the points in \\( C \\cap A \\) are in the interior of \\( A \\), and the points in \\( C \\cap (X - A) \\) are in the interior of \\( X - A \\). If \\( C \\) did not intersect \\(\\operatorname{Bd} A\\), these two sets would be disjoint and open in the subspace topology on \\( C \\), effectively splitting \\( C \\) into two non-empty, disjoint open sets. This is impossible because \\( C \\) is connected.\n\nTherefore, the only way for \\( C \\) to remain connected while intersecting both \\( A \\) and \\( X - A \\) is for it to also intersect the boundary \\(\\operatorname{Bd} A\\).

This point \\( x \\) is called a fixed point of the function \\( f \\).\n\nTo approach this, we define a new function \\( g(x) = f(x) - x \\).

In a topological group, the component containing the identity element \\( e \\) is the connected component of the identity. This means \\( C \\) is the largest connected subset of \\( G \\) that includes \\( e \\). Since \\( C \\) is connected and contains \\( e \\), it is a subgroup of \\( G \\).

A subgroup \\( H \\) of a group \\( G \\) is normal if, for every element \\( g \\) in \\( G \\), the left coset \\( gH \\) is equal to the right coset \\( Hg \\).

This means that if you have a collection of open sets that cover the entire space, and this collection is countable, you can find a finite number of these sets that still cover the entire space.\n\n**Limit Point Compactness**: A space is limit point compact if every infinite subset has a limit point in the space. A limit point of a set is a point where every neighborhood of it contains at least one point from the set, other than possibly the point itself.\n\n**$T_1$ Space**: In a $T_1$ space, for any two distinct points, each has a neighborhood not containing the other. This implies that singletons are closed sets.\n\nNow, let's prove the equivalence:\n\n1. **Countably Compact implies Limit Point Compact**: Assume $X$ is countably compact. Take any infinite subset $A$ of $X$. We need to show that $A$ has a limit point in $X$. Suppose for contradiction that $A$ has no limit point. This means for each point $x \\in X$, there is an open set $U_x$ containing $x$ that intersects $A$ in only finitely many points. The collection of all such $U_x$ for $x \\in X$ forms an open cover of $X$. Since $X$ is countably compact, there is a finite subcover. However, this would imply that $A$ is finite, contradicting our assumption that $A$ is infinite.

Consider a countable open cover $\\{U_n\\}_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ of $X$. We need to find a finite subcover. Suppose for contradiction that no finite subcollection covers $X$. Then, for each finite subcollection, there is a point in $X$ not covered by it. Using the axiom of countable choice, construct a sequence $\\{x_n\\}$ such that $x_n$ is not covered by $\\{U_1, U_2, \\ldots, U_n\\}$. The set $\\{x_n\\}$ is infinite, and since $X$ is limit point compact, it must have a limit point $x$. However, $x$ must be in some $U_k$ because $\\{U_n\\}$ covers $X$. This contradicts the construction of $\\{x_n\\}$, where $x_n$ is not in any $U_k$ for $k \\leq n$. Thus, a finite subcover must exist, proving that $X$ is countably compact.\n\nIn conclusion, for a $T_1$ space, countable compactness and limit point compactness are equivalent because the properties of $T_1$ spaces ensure that the definitions of these compactness concepts align perfectly, allowing us to use the properties of open covers and limit points interchangeably.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

Specifically, \\( d(f(x), f(y)) = d(x, y) \\). \n\nTo prove injectivity, assume \\( f(x) = f(y) \\). Then, by the property of isometries, \\( d(f(x), f(y)) = 0 \\). Since \\( d(x, y) = d(f(x), f(y)) = 0 \\), it follows that \\( x = y \\). Therefore, \\( f \\) is injective.\n\n### Step 2: Show that \\( f \\) is surjective.\n\nSince \\( X \\) is compact, it is both closed and bounded. A key property of compact spaces is that any continuous injective function from a compact space to itself is also surjective. \n\nWe already know from the context that isometries are continuous. Therefore, since \\( f \\) is a continuous injective function from the compact space \\( X \\) to itself, it must also be surjective. Thus, \\( f \\) is bijective.\n\n### Step 3: Show that \\( f \\) is a homeomorphism.\n\nA function is a homeomorphism if it is a bijective continuous function whose inverse is also continuous. We have already established that \\( f \\) is bijective and continuous. \n\nFrom the context, we know that the inverse of an isometry is also an isometry, and hence continuous. Therefore, \\( f^{-1} \\) is continuous.\n\nSince \\( f \\) is bijective, continuous, and its inverse \\( f^{-1} \\) is also continuous, \\( f \\) is a homeomorphism.\n\nIn conclusion, if \\( f \\) is an isometry on a compact metric space \\( X \\), then \\( f \\) is bijective and a homeomorphism.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

A space is locally compact if every point has a neighborhood that is compact. In the context of $[0, 1]^\\omega$, this means that for any point (which is a sequence of numbers from $[0, 1]$), there should be a neighborhood around it that is compact.\n\nLet's consider what $[0, 1]^\\omega$ represents. It is the set of all infinite sequences where each element of the sequence is a number between 0 and 1. The uniform topology on this space is defined such that two sequences are \"close\" if they agree on a large initial segment and the differences in the remaining terms are small.\n\nNow, to argue that $[0, 1]^\\omega$ is not locally compact, we can draw an analogy with the irrational number space $\\R \\setminus \\Q$ under the Euclidean topology, which is known not to be locally compact. The key reason for this is that any neighborhood of a point in $\\R \\setminus \\Q$ cannot be compact because it would have to be nowhere dense, leading to a contradiction when trying to contain a non-empty open set.\n\nSimilarly, in $[0, 1]^\\omega$, consider any point, which is a sequence $(x_1, x_2, x_3, \\ldots)$. Suppose there is a neighborhood around this sequence that is compact. In the uniform topology, such a neighborhood would consist of sequences that are close to $(x_1, x_2, x_3, \\ldots)$ in the sense that they agree on a large initial segment and differ only slightly thereafter.\n\nHowever, the space $[0, 1]^\\omega$ is too \"large\" and \"spread out\" for any such neighborhood to be compact. Compactness in infinite-dimensional spaces like $[0, 1]^\\omega$ often fails because there are too many degrees of freedom. Specifically, compactness would require that every open cover of the neighborhood has a finite subcover, but the sheer variety of sequences that can be formed in $[0, 1]^\\omega$ makes this impossible.\n\nThus, no matter which point we choose in $[0, 1]^\\omega$, we cannot find a compact neighborhood around it. Therefore, $[0, 1]^\\omega$ is not locally compact in the uniform topology.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'Compactness.LocallyCompactSpace.false'\nPlease revise the proof.",

        "informal_proof": "# Informal Proof:\n\nTo show that a countable product of spaces, each having a countable dense subset, also has a countable dense subset, we can use the following reasoning:\n\nFirst, let's understand what we are dealing with. We have a collection of topological spaces, each of which has a countable dense subset. A dense subset in a topological space is a subset such that every point in the space is either in the subset or is a limit point of the subset. When we say a subset is countable, it means it can be put into a one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers, or it is finite.\n\nNow, consider the product of these spaces. The product space is formed by taking all possible tuples where each element of the tuple comes from one of the spaces in our collection. The topology on this product space is typically the product topology, which is generated by sets that are products of open sets from each of the component spaces, with all but finitely many of these open sets being the entire space.\n\nThe key idea is to construct a dense subset for the product space using the dense subsets from each of the component spaces. For each space in our collection, we have a countable dense subset. Let's denote these dense subsets as \\( D_\\alpha \\) for each index \\(\\alpha\\).\n\nWe form a new set \\( D \\) by taking the product of these dense subsets, i.e., \\( D = \\prod_{\\alpha} D_\\alpha \\). This means that each element of \\( D \\) is a tuple where each component of the tuple is an element from the corresponding dense subset \\( D_\\alpha \\).\n\nThe set \\( D \\) is countable because it is a countable product of countable sets. This follows from the fact that a countable union of countable sets is countable, and in this case, we are essentially taking a countable union of countable choices for each component of the tuples.\n\nNext, we need to show that \\( D \\) is dense in the product space. In the product topology, a basis element is a product of open sets, where all but finitely many of these open sets are the entire space. To show that \\( D \\) is dense, we need to show that every such basis element intersects \\( D \\).\n\nConsider a basis element \\( U = \\prod_{\\alpha} U_\\alpha \\), where each \\( U_\\alpha \\) is open in the corresponding space, and for all but finitely many \\(\\alpha\\), \\( U_\\alpha \\) is the entire space. Since each \\( D_\\alpha \\) is dense in its respective space, for each \\(\\alpha\\), the intersection \\( U_\\alpha \\cap D_\\alpha \\) is non-empty. We can pick an element \\( x_\\alpha \\) from each of these intersections.\n\nThe tuple \\( (x_\\alpha) \\) formed by these elements is in the intersection of \\( U \\) and \\( D \\), because each \\( x_\\alpha \\) is in both \\( U_\\alpha \\) and \\( D_\\alpha \\). Therefore, \\( U \\cap D \\neq \\emptyset \\).\n\nSince every basis element of the product topology intersects \\( D \\), \\( D \\) is dense in the product space. Thus, we have constructed a countable dense subset for the product space, proving the theorem.\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  Exists.intro (s.prod t)\nargument\n  s.prod t\nhas type\n  Set (X 0 \u00d7 X 1) : Type u_1\nbut is expected to have type\n  Set ((i : \u2115) \u2192 X i) : Type u_1\nPlease revise the proof.",

This property is crucial because it allows us to separate points using open sets, which is a step towards finding disjoint neighborhoods.\n\nLet's consider two distinct points, say \\( p \\) and \\( q \\), in a regular space \\( X \\). Our goal is to find open neighborhoods \\( U \\) of \\( p \\) and \\( V \\) of \\( q \\) such that the closures of these neighborhoods, denoted \\( \\overline{U} \\) and \\( \\overline{V} \\), do not overlap.\n\n1. **Separate Points with Open Sets**: Since \\( X \\) is regular, we can use its defining property. Consider the point \\( p \\) and the singleton set \\( \\{q\\} \\), which is closed because singletons are closed in a regular space. By the regularity of \\( X \\), there exist disjoint open sets \\( U \\) and \\( W \\) such that \\( p \\in U \\) and \\( q \\in W \\).\n\n2. **Repeat for the Other Point**: Similarly, consider \\( q \\) and the singleton set \\( \\{p\\} \\).

The key is to ensure that the closures \\( \\overline{U} \\) and \\( \\overline{V} \\) are disjoint. \n\n4. **Using Disjointness of Open Sets**: Since \\( U \\) and \\( W \\) are disjoint, \\( q \\notin \\overline{U} \\) because \\( q \\) is in \\( W \\) and not in \\( U \\). Similarly, since \\( V \\) and \\( Z \\) are disjoint, \\( p \\notin \\overline{V} \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the closures \\( \\overline{U} \\) and \\( \\overline{V} \\) are disjoint because neither closure contains the other point. This is because the closure of a set in a topological space is the smallest closed set containing the original set, and since \\( p \\notin \\overline{V} \\) and \\( q \\notin \\overline{U} \\), the closures cannot overlap.\n\nThus, in a regular space, for any two distinct points, we can find neighborhoods whose closures are disjoint, satisfying the condition we set out to prove.\nPrevious attempt failed with: tactic 'apply' failed, failed to unify\n  ?U \u2208 ?x\nwith\n  \u2203 U, IsOpen U \u2227 x \u2208 U \u2227 closure U \u2229 {y} = \u2205\nX : Type u_1\ninst\u271d : TopologicalSpace X\nhX : RegularSpace X\nx y : X\n\u22a2 \u2203 U, IsOpen U \u2227 x \u2208 U \u2227 closure U \u2229 {y} = \u2205\ntactic 'apply' failed, failed to unify\n  ?U \u2208 ?x\nwith\n  \u2203 V, IsOpen V \u2227 y \u2208 V \u2227 closure V \u2229 {x} = \u2205\nX : Type u_1\ninst\u271d : TopologicalSpace X\nhX : RegularSpace X\nx y : X\nU : Set X\nhU_open : IsOpen U\nhxU : x \u2208 U\nhUy : closure U \u2229 {y} = \u2205\n\u22a2 \u2203 V, IsOpen V \u2227 y \u2208 V \u2227 closure V \u2229 {x} = \u2205\ntactic 'constructor' failed, no applicable constructor found\ncase h.right.right.right.right\nX : Type u_1\ninst\u271d : TopologicalSpace X\nhX : RegularSpace X\nx y : X\nU : Set X\nhU_open : IsOpen U\nhxU : x \u2208 U\nhUy : closure U \u2229 {y} = \u2205\nV : Set X\nhV_open : IsOpen V\nhyV : y \u2208 V\nhVx : closure V \u2229 {x} = \u2205\n\u22a2 closure U \u2229 closure V = \u2205\nPlease revise the proof.",

An order topology is defined on a set with a total order, where the open sets are generated by intervals of the form \\((a, b)\\), \\((-\\infty, b)\\), and \\((a, \\infty)\\).

In other words, for any two closed sets that do not intersect, there exist open sets containing each closed set such that these open sets do not intersect either.\n\nNow, consider the product space $\\prod X_\\alpha$.

The product topology is defined such that a set is open if it can be expressed as a union of products of open sets from each $X_\\alpha$, where all but finitely many of these open sets are the entire space $X_\\alpha$.\n\nThe context provided tells us that if the product space $\\prod X_\\alpha$ is normal, then each factor space $X_\\alpha$ must also be normal. This is because the property of being normal is preserved in the factor spaces when the product space is normal. The reasoning behind this is as follows:\n\n1. **$T_1$ Property**: If the product space is $T_1$, then each factor space must be $T_1$. This is because the projection maps from the product space to each factor space are continuous, and the $T_1$ property is preserved under continuous images.\n\n2. **Separation of Closed Sets**: If the product space can separate any two disjoint closed sets with open sets, then each factor space must also be able to do this. This is because any closed set in a factor space can be seen as a \"slice\" of a closed set in the product space. If the product space can separate these slices, then the factor space can separate its own closed sets.\n\nTherefore, if $\\prod X_\\alpha$ is normal, it implies that each $X_\\alpha$ is normal because the ability to separate disjoint closed sets in the product space translates to the ability to do so in each factor space. This is a direct consequence of how the product topology and the properties of normal spaces interact.\n\nIn summary, the normality of the product space ensures that each factor space inherits this property, as the separation of closed sets in the product space implies the separation of closed sets in each individual space.

In simpler terms, around every point, we can find neighborhoods that are compact, meaning they are closed and bounded in some sense.\n\nNext, a space is Hausdorff if for any two distinct points, there exist neighborhoods of each that do not overlap.

By the Hausdorff property, we can find disjoint open sets \\( U \\) and \\( V \\) such that \\( x \\in U \\) and \\( F \\subset V \\).\n\n4. **Using Compactness**: Since the space is locally compact, we can choose a compact neighborhood \\( K \\) of \\( x \\) such that \\( K \\subset U \\). The compactness of \\( K \\) is crucial because it allows us to use the Urysohn Lemma, which is applicable in normal spaces (and compact Hausdorff spaces are normal).\n\n5. **Applying Urysohn's Lemma**: The Urysohn Lemma states that in a normal space, for any two disjoint closed sets, there exists a continuous function that maps one set to 0 and the other to 1. Here, we can consider \\( K \\) as one closed set and \\( F \\) as another (since \\( F \\) is closed and \\( K \\) is compact, hence closed in a Hausdorff space).\n\n6. **Conclusion**: By applying the Urysohn Lemma, we can construct a continuous function that maps \\( x \\) (or more precisely, the compact neighborhood \\( K \\) containing \\( x \\)) to 0 and the closed set \\( F \\) to 1. This function demonstrates the complete regularity of the space.\n\nThus, every locally compact Hausdorff space is completely regular because we can always find a continuous function to separate a point from a closed set, leveraging the compactness and separation properties inherent in such spaces.\nPrevious attempt failed with: application type mismatch\n  LocallyCompactSpace.local_compact_nhds x (\ud835\udcdd x)\nargument\n  \ud835\udcdd x\nhas type\n  Filter X : Type u_1\nbut is expected to have type\n  Set X : Type u_1\nPlease revise the proof.",

We are given that \\( X \\) is a compact Hausdorff space and is the union of two closed subspaces \\( X_1 \\) and \\( X_2 \\), both of which are metrizable.\n\nFirst, let's recall what it means for a space to be metrizable: a topological space is metrizable if there exists a metric (a distance function) that induces the topology of the space. Since \\( X_1 \\) and \\( X_2 \\) are metrizable, there exist metrics \\( d_1 \\) and \\( d_2 \\) that define the topologies on \\( X_1 \\) and \\( X_2 \\), respectively.\n\nNow, because \\( X \\) is compact and Hausdorff, it has some nice properties. Compactness in a Hausdorff space implies that \\( X \\) is normal, meaning any two disjoint closed sets can be separated by neighborhoods. This property will be useful in constructing a metric for \\( X \\).\n\nSince \\( X_1 \\) and \\( X_2 \\) are closed in \\( X \\), they are compact as well (because closed subsets of compact spaces are compact). The compactness of \\( X_1 \\) and \\( X_2 \\) ensures that any open cover of these spaces has a finite subcover, which is a key property when dealing with metrizable spaces.\n\nTo construct a metric on \\( X \\), we can use the fact that \\( X_1 \\) and \\( X_2 \\) are metrizable and compact. One common technique is to use a partition of unity subordinate to the open cover of \\( X \\) by \\( X_1 \\) and \\( X_2 \\). A partition of unity is a collection of continuous functions that are used to \"glue\" local data together to form global data.\n\nSince \\( X_1 \\) and \\( X_2 \\) are closed and \\( X \\) is compact, we can find continuous functions \\( f_1: X \\to [0, 1] \\) and \\( f_2: X \\to [0, 1] \\) such that \\( f_1(x) + f_2(x) = 1 \\) for all \\( x \\in X \\), \\( f_1(x) = 1 \\) for \\( x \\in X_1 \\setminus X_2 \\), and \\( f_2(x) = 1 \\) for \\( x \\in X_2 \\setminus X_1 \\).\n\nUsing these functions, we can define a metric \\( d \\) on \\( X \\) by setting:\n\\[ d(x, y) = f_1(x)f_1(y)d_1(x, y) + f_2(x)f_2(y)d_2(x, y) \\]\nfor \\( x, y \\in X \\).\n\nThis metric \\( d \\) is continuous and respects the topologies of \\( X_1 \\) and \\( X_2 \\) because it reduces to \\( d_1 \\) on \\( X_1 \\) and \\( d_2 \\) on \\( X_2 \\). The continuity of \\( f_1 \\) and \\( f_2 \\) ensures that \\( d \\) is a valid metric on \\( X \\).\n\nThus, we have constructed a metric on \\( X \\) that induces the topology of \\( X \\), showing that \\( X \\) is metrizable.\nPrevious attempt failed with: invalid field 'toPseudoMetricSpace', the environment does not contain 'TopologicalSpace.MetrizableSpace.toPseudoMetricSpace'\n  hX1m\nhas type\n  MetrizableSpace \u2191X1\ninvalid field 'toPseudoMetricSpace', the environment does not contain 'TopologicalSpace.MetrizableSpace.toPseudoMetricSpace'\n  hX2m\nhas type\n  MetrizableSpace \u2191X2\nunknown identifier 'metrizableSpace_of_closed_univ'\nPlease revise the proof.",

This property is stronger than regular continuity because \\( \\delta \\) is chosen independently of the specific points in \\( A \\).\n\n2. **Closure of \\( A \\)**: The closure \\( \\bar{A} \\) of a set \\( A \\) in a metric space \\( X \\) includes all the points in \\( A \\) plus any limit points of sequences from \\( A \\). This means that if you have a sequence of points in \\( A \\) that converges to some point \\( a \\), then \\( a \\) is in \\( \\bar{A} \\).\n\n3. **Extending \\( f \\) to \\( g \\)**: To extend \\( f \\) to a function \\( g \\) on \\( \\bar{A} \\), we need to define \\( g \\) at points in \\( \\bar{A} \\setminus A \\). For a point \\( a \\in \\bar{A} \\), consider sequences \\( \\{a_n\\} \\) in \\( A \\) that converge to \\( a \\). Since \\( f \\) is uniformly continuous and \\( Y \\) is complete, the sequence \\( \\{f(a_n)\\} \\) is Cauchy in \\( Y \\) and thus converges to some limit in \\( Y \\). Define \\( g(a) \\) to be this limit.\n\n4. **Uniqueness of the Extension**: To ensure that \\( g \\) is well-defined, we must show that the limit of \\( \\{f(a_n)\\} \\) is the same regardless of the sequence \\( \\{a_n\\} \\) chosen, as long as \\( a_n \\to a \\). This follows from the completeness of \\( Y \\) and the uniform continuity of \\( f \\), which ensures that any two such sequences will have their images under \\( f \\) converge to the same point in \\( Y \\).\n\n5. **Continuity of \\( g \\)**: The function \\( g \\) is continuous on \\( \\bar{A} \\) because for any sequence \\( \\{a_n\\} \\) in \\( \\bar{A} \\) converging to \\( a \\), the sequence \\( \\{g(a_n)\\} \\) converges to \\( g(a) \\). This is a direct consequence of how we defined \\( g \\) using limits of sequences.\n\n6. **Uniform Continuity of \\( g \\)**: Finally, \\( g \\) is uniformly continuous on \\( \\bar{A} \\) because the uniform continuity of \\( f \\) on \\( A \\) extends to \\( \\bar{A} \\) due to the way limits work in complete metric spaces. Essentially, the same \\( \\delta \\) that works for \\( f \\) on \\( A \\) will work for \\( g \\) on \\( \\bar{A} \\).\n\nIn summary, by leveraging the properties of uniform continuity and the completeness of \\( Y \\), we can uniquely extend \\( f \\) to a continuous and uniformly continuous function \\( g \\) on the closure \\( \\bar{A} \\).

Each term in the sum is a fraction of the form \\(\\frac{1}{k}\\), where \\(k\\) is an integer greater than 1.\n\nLet's start by considering the denominators of these fractions. The least common multiple (LCM) of the numbers \\(2, 3, \\ldots, n\\) will be the smallest number that each of these denominators divides. This LCM will be a very large number, especially as \\(n\\) increases, because it must be divisible by each of these integers.\n\nNow, consider the sum \\(\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{n}\\). If this sum were to be an integer, then when we express this sum with a common denominator (the LCM of \\(2, 3, \\ldots, n\\)), the numerator would have to be exactly divisible by this LCM. However, this is highly unlikely because:\n\n1. Each fraction \\(\\frac{1}{k}\\) contributes a term to the numerator that is the LCM divided by \\(k\\). These contributions are generally not aligned in such a way that their sum is exactly the LCM, especially since the LCM is a product of many distinct prime factors.\n\n2. The harmonic sum \\(\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{n}\\) grows logarithmically, meaning it increases but at a decreasing rate. This growth pattern does not align with the growth of integers, which increase linearly.\n\n3. For small values of \\(n\\), we can directly compute the sum and observe that it is not an integer. For example, for \\(n = 2\\), the sum is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), and for \\(n = 3\\), the sum is \\(\\frac{5}{6}\\), neither of which are integers.\n\n4. More formally, one can show that for any \\(n \\geq 2\\), the sum \\(\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{n}\\) is never an integer by considering the prime factorization of the LCM and the resulting numerator. The presence of multiple distinct prime factors in the LCM ensures that the numerator cannot be a multiple of the LCM, thus preventing the sum from being an integer.\n\nIn conclusion, due to the nature of the harmonic series and the properties of the denominators involved, the sum \\(\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{n}\\) cannot be an integer for any \\(n \\geq 2\\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: linarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase intro\nn : \u2115\na : \u2124\nh : \u2211 i : Fin n, 1 / (\u2191n + 2) = \u2191a\nthis : \u2191n * (\u2191n + 2)\u207b\u00b9 = \u2191a\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nunsolved goals\ncase intro\nn : \u2115\na : \u2124\nh : \u2211 i : Fin n, 1 / (\u2191n + 2) = \u2191a\nthis : \u2191n * (\u2191n + 2)\u207b\u00b9 = \u2191a\n\u22a2 False\nPlease revise the proof.",

A square-free integer is an integer that is not divisible by any perfect square other than 1. In other words, it is an integer that has no repeated prime factors.\n\nFirst, let's consider the set of all square-free integers. These integers can be expressed as products of distinct prime numbers. For example, 6 is square-free because it is the product of the distinct primes 2 and 3, while 12 is not square-free because it includes the square of 2.\n\nThe key idea is to relate the sum of the reciprocals of square-free integers to the sum of the reciprocals of all integers. We know that the sum of the reciprocals of all positive integers, \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n}\\), diverges. This is the well-known harmonic series.\n\nNow, consider the sum of the reciprocals of square-free integers, \\(\\sum_{n \\text{ square-free}} \\frac{1}{n}\\). Each square-free integer can be written as a product of distinct primes, and there are many such products. In fact, for any given integer \\(n\\), there are square-free integers that are less than or equal to \\(n\\) and are composed of distinct primes. \n\nThe density of square-free integers among all integers is relatively high. Specifically, the probability that a randomly chosen integer is square-free is \\(\\frac{6}{\\pi^2}\\), which is a positive constant. This means that a significant proportion of integers are square-free.\n\nSince the sum of the reciprocals of all integers diverges, and since square-free integers make up a significant proportion of all integers, the sum of the reciprocals of square-free integers must also diverge. If the sum of the reciprocals of square-free integers were to converge, it would imply that the sum of the reciprocals of all integers converges, which is a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the reciprocals of square-free integers diverges.\nPrevious attempt failed with: (deterministic) timeout at `isDefEq`, maximum number of heartbeats (200000) has been reached\nuse `set_option maxHeartbeats <num>` to set the limit\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\n(deterministic) timeout at `whnf`, maximum number of heartbeats (200000) has been reached\nuse `set_option maxHeartbeats <num>` to set the limit\nuse `set_option diagnostics true` to get diagnostic information\nPlease revise the proof.",

For example, 6 is composite because it can be written as \\( 2 \\times 3 \\).\n\nNow, consider the factorial \\((n-1)!\\), which is the product of all positive integers from 1 to \\( n-1 \\). For a composite number \\( n \\), we can express \\( n \\) as \\( n = r \\times s \\), where \\( r \\) and \\( s \\) are integers greater than 1 and less than \\( n \\).\n\nSince both \\( r \\) and \\( s \\) are less than \\( n \\), they are included in the product \\((n-1)!\\). Therefore, the product \\( r \\times s = n \\) is a factor of \\((n-1)!\\), which means \\( n \\) divides \\((n-1)!\\).\n\nHowever, there is an exception when \\( n = 4 \\). The factorial \\((4-1)! = 3! = 6\\), and 4 does not divide 6. This is because 4 is a special case where the factors 2 and 2 (since \\( 4 = 2 \\times 2 \\)) do not both appear in the sequence from 1 to 3. Thus, 4 is the only composite number for which \\((n-1)!\\) is not divisible by \\( n \\).\n\nFor all other composite numbers, either they can be expressed as a product of two distinct integers less than \\( n \\), or they are squares of primes greater than 2. In the case of squares of primes, say \\( n = p^2 \\), the number \\( 2p \\) is less than \\( p^2 \\) and appears in the factorial sequence, ensuring divisibility.\n\nIn summary, for any composite number \\( n \\neq 4 \\), \\((n-1)!\\) includes all necessary factors to ensure divisibility by \\( n \\). The exception of \\( n = 4 \\) arises because its factors do not fit within the factorial sequence of numbers less than 4.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

In other words, 3 should have an order of \\( p-1 \\) modulo \\( p \\).\n\nFirst, let's recall what a Fermat prime is. A Fermat prime is a prime number of the form \\( p = 2^{2^k} + 1 \\). These primes have a special property: the number of non-zero residues modulo \\( p \\) is \\( p-1 = 2^{2^k} \\). This is a power of 2, which is crucial for our argument.\n\nNow, for 3 to be a primitive root modulo \\( p \\), the order of 3 modulo \\( p \\) must be exactly \\( p-1 \\). The order of an integer \\( a \\) modulo \\( p \\) is the smallest positive integer \\( d \\) such that \\( a^d \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p} \\). For 3 to be a primitive root, \\( d \\) must be \\( p-1 \\).\n\nThe order of any number modulo \\( p \\) must divide \\( p-1 \\). Since \\( p-1 = 2^{2^k} \\), the possible orders of 3 are powers of 2: \\( 1, 2, 4, \\ldots, 2^{2^k} \\).\n\nTo show that 3 has the maximum order \\( 2^{2^k} \\), we need to show that 3 does not satisfy \\( 3^d \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p} \\) for any \\( d < 2^{2^k} \\). This means 3 should not be a power of a smaller order.\n\nOne way to argue this is by using properties of Fermat primes and primitive roots. For Fermat primes, it is known that every non-zero residue modulo \\( p \\) is a power of a primitive root. Since \\( p = 2^{2^k} + 1 \\) is a Fermat prime, it has a primitive root, and 3 is one of the candidates.\n\nTo verify that 3 is indeed a primitive root, we can use the fact that for Fermat primes, the multiplicative group of integers modulo \\( p \\) is cyclic. This means there exists a number that generates all non-zero residues, and 3 is often such a number due to its properties and the structure of Fermat primes.\n\nThus, by the nature of Fermat primes and the properties of primitive roots, 3 is a primitive root modulo \\( p = 2^{2^k} + 1 \\). This completes the informal proof that 3 is a primitive root modulo a Fermat prime.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token 'have'; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

This means that any integer not divisible by \\( p \\) can be represented by one of these numbers. When we raise these numbers to a power \\( k \\), we are essentially looking at the behavior of these powers under modulo \\( p \\).\n\n2. **Case 1: \\( p-1 \\nmid k \\):**\n\n   When \\( p-1 \\nmid k \\), \\( k \\) is not a multiple of \\( p-1 \\). By Fermat's Little Theorem, for any integer \\( a \\) not divisible by \\( p \\), we have \\( a^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p} \\). If \\( k \\) is not a multiple of \\( p-1 \\), then \\( a^k \\) does not necessarily simplify to 1 for all \\( a \\).\n\n   However, the key insight is that the sum \\( 1^k + 2^k + \\cdots + (p-1)^k \\) is symmetric. Each term \\( a^k \\) has a corresponding term \\( (p-a)^k \\), and these pairs sum to zero modulo \\( p \\) because \\( a^k + (p-a)^k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p} \\) when \\( p-1 \\nmid k \\).

We need to find a connection between the existence of a solution to the congruence \\( x^4 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{p} \\) and the representation of \\( p \\) as \\( A^2 + 64B^2 \\). The condition \\( p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4} \\) is crucial because it implies that \\( -1 \\) is a quadratic residue modulo \\( p \\), which is a property that often facilitates the expression of numbers as sums of squares.\n\n### Step 2: Connection to Quadratic Residues\n\nFor \\( x^4 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{p} \\) to have a solution, \\( 2 \\) must be a quartic residue modulo \\( p \\). This means there exists some integer \\( x \\) such that \\( x^4 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{p} \\). Since \\( p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4} \\), we know from quadratic reciprocity and related results that certain numbers, like \\( -1 \\), are quadratic residues, which can help in finding such \\( x \\).\n\n### Step 3: Representation as a Sum of Squares\n\nThe form \\( A^2 + 64B^2 \\) is reminiscent of the forms that primes can take when expressed as sums of squares. Specifically, Fermat's Two Squares Theorem tells us that a prime \\( p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4} \\) can be expressed as a sum of two squares. The form \\( A^2 + 64B^2 \\) is a specific case where one of the squares is scaled by 64, which is \\( 8^2 \\).\n\n### Step 4: Proving the \"If\" Direction\n\nSuppose \\( p = A^2 + 64B^2 \\). We want to show that \\( x^4 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{p} \\) has a solution. The expression \\( A^2 + 64B^2 \\) suggests a connection to the Gaussian integers, where numbers can be expressed in terms of sums of squares. The presence of 64, a perfect square, indicates that the structure of the number allows for certain symmetries and properties that make \\( 2 \\) a quartic residue.\n\n### Step 5: Proving the \"Only If\" Direction\n\nConversely, if \\( x^4 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{p} \\) has a solution, then \\( 2 \\) is a quartic residue modulo \\( p \\). This implies certain algebraic properties about \\( p \\) that align with it being expressible as \\( A^2 + 64B^2 \\). The existence of such a solution suggests that \\( p \\) has a specific form that accommodates the symmetry and properties of quartic residues, which is captured by the expression \\( A^2 + 64B^2 \\).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, the problem is deeply connected to the properties of quadratic and quartic residues and the representation of primes as sums of squares. The condition \\( p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4} \\) ensures that \\( p \\) can be expressed in forms that allow for such congruences to have solutions, specifically in the form \\( A^2 + 64B^2 \\). This connection is a beautiful example of how number theory links different areas, such as congruences and sums of squares, to provide insights into the structure of numbers.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ','; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

The function \\( f \\) is given to be infinitely differentiable, which means it has derivatives of all orders, and it satisfies the conditions \\( f(0) = 0 \\), \\( f(1) = 1 \\), and \\( f(x) \\geq 0 \\) for all \\( x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\).\n\nLet's start by considering the behavior of \\( f \\) between \\( x = 0 \\) and \\( x = 1 \\). Since \\( f(0) = 0 \\) and \\( f(1) = 1 \\), and \\( f(x) \\geq 0 \\) for all \\( x \\), the function must increase from 0 to 1 over this interval. This suggests that the first derivative \\( f'(x) \\) is positive at least somewhere in the interval \\([0, 1]\\).\n\nNow, consider the possibility that all derivatives of \\( f \\) are non-negative for all \\( x \\). If this were true, then \\( f \\) would be a non-decreasing function everywhere, which contradicts the fact that \\( f(0) = 0 \\) and \\( f(1) = 1 \\) while \\( f(x) \\geq 0 \\) for all \\( x \\). This implies that \\( f \\) must have some regions where it is not strictly increasing, which would require some derivative to be negative at some point.\n\nTo find such a derivative, consider the following reasoning: if \\( f \\) were to remain non-negative and non-decreasing everywhere, it would imply that \\( f(x) \\) is a linear function of the form \\( f(x) = x \\) over the interval \\([0, 1]\\). However, this would not satisfy the condition \\( f(x) \\geq 0 \\) for all \\( x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\) unless \\( f(x) = 0 \\) for \\( x < 0 \\) and \\( f(x) = 1 \\) for \\( x > 1 \\), which is not possible for an infinitely differentiable function.\n\nTherefore, there must be some point where the behavior of \\( f \\) changes, and this change is captured by a negative derivative. Specifically, as \\( f \\) transitions from being zero at \\( x = 0 \\) to one at \\( x = 1 \\), the function must \"bend\" in such a way that at some point, a higher-order derivative becomes negative to accommodate the constraints \\( f(0) = 0 \\), \\( f(1) = 1 \\), and \\( f(x) \\geq 0 \\).\n\nThus, there exists a positive integer \\( n \\) and a real number \\( x \\) such that \\( f^{(n)}(x) < 0 \\).

The sequence is defined as follows:\n\n- \\( x_0 = 1 \\)\n- \\( x_1 = x_2 = a \\)\n- For \\( n \\geq 2 \\), \\( x_{n+1} = 2x_n x_{n-1} - x_{n-2} \\)\n\nThe key part of the problem is the recurrence relation: \\( x_{n+1} = 2x_n x_{n-1} - x_{n-2} \\). This relation uses the three preceding terms to determine the next term in the sequence.\n\nNow, let's consider what happens if \\( x_n = 0 \\) for some \\( n \\). Suppose \\( x_n = 0 \\). Then, according to the recurrence relation:\n\n\\[ x_{n+1} = 2x_n x_{n-1} - x_{n-2} = 2 \\cdot 0 \\cdot x_{n-1} - x_{n-2} = -x_{n-2} \\]\n\nThis means that \\( x_{n+1} = -x_{n-2} \\).\n\nNext, consider \\( x_{n+2} \\):\n\n\\[ x_{n+2} = 2x_{n+1} x_n - x_{n-1} = 2(-x_{n-2}) \\cdot 0 - x_{n-1} = -x_{n-1} \\]\n\nContinuing this pattern, we find:\n\n- \\( x_{n+3} = 2x_{n+2} x_{n+1} - x_n = 2(-x_{n-1})(-x_{n-2}) - 0 = 2x_{n-1}x_{n-2} \\)\n- \\( x_{n+4} = 2x_{n+3} x_{n+2} - x_{n+1} = 2(2x_{n-1}x_{n-2})(-x_{n-1}) - (-x_{n-2}) = 4x_{n-1}^2x_{n-2} + x_{n-2} \\)\n\nNotice that the terms \\( x_{n+1}, x_{n+2}, x_{n+3}, \\ldots \\) are determined by the values of \\( x_{n-1} \\) and \\( x_{n-2} \\). If \\( x_n = 0 \\), the sequence starts to repeat the values of the previous terms in a predictable manner, as each new term is a function of the previous three terms.\n\nThus, if \\( x_n = 0 \\) for some \\( n \\), the sequence will start to repeat itself, making it periodic. The periodicity arises because the recurrence relation effectively \"resets\" the sequence to a state that depends only on the previous terms, and this state will recur as the sequence progresses.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown identifier 'begin'\nunexpected token ':='; expected command\ninvalid 'end', insufficient scopes\nPlease revise the proof.",

A self-distributive operation is a binary operation, let's denote it by *, that satisfies a certain distributive-like property. In the context of left self-distributivity, this property can be expressed as:\n\nFor any elements a, b, and c, the operation * satisfies:\n\\[ a * (b * c) = (a * b) * (a * c) \\]\n\nThis means that when you apply the operation * to a single element a and the result of another operation b * c, it is equivalent to applying the operation * to a and b, and then again to a and c, and finally applying * to the results of these two operations.\n\nTo prove that a given operation is left self-distributive, we need to show that this property holds for all possible choices of a, b, and c in the set where the operation is defined. \n\nLet's consider a simple example to illustrate this. Suppose we have a set of numbers and an operation * defined as multiplication. We want to check if multiplication is left self-distributive. According to the left self-distributive property, we need to verify:\n\n\\[ a \\times (b \\times c) = (a \\times b) \\times (a \\times c) \\]\n\nHowever, if we substitute specific numbers, say a = 2, b = 3, and c = 4, we find:\n\n\\[ 2 \\times (3 \\times 4) = 2 \\times 12 = 24 \\]\n\nOn the other hand:\n\n\\[ (2 \\times 3) \\times (2 \\times 4) = 6 \\times 8 = 48 \\]\n\nSince 24 is not equal to 48, multiplication does not satisfy the left self-distributive property. This example shows that not all operations are self-distributive.\n\nIn general, to prove that a specific operation is left self-distributive, you would need to demonstrate that the left self-distributive equation holds for all elements in the set. This often involves algebraic manipulation and sometimes leveraging specific properties of the operation or the set.\n\nIn summary, the key to proving left self-distributivity is to verify that the operation satisfies the left self-distributive equation for all possible elements in the set. This involves checking that the operation distributes over itself from the left side, as defined by the property.\nPrevious attempt failed with: unknown constant 'Polynomial.isCoprime_of_commute'\nPlease revise the proof.",

We are given that the function \\( f \\) and its first three derivatives are positive, and that the third derivative \\( f'''(x) \\) is less than or equal to the function \\( f(x) \\).\n\nLet's break down the information and see how it can help us:\n\n1. **Positivity of \\( f(x) \\), \\( f'(x) \\), \\( f''(x) \\), and \\( f'''(x) \\):** This tells us that the function and its derivatives are all above zero, which implies that the function is increasing, and its rate of increase is also increasing, at least initially.\n\n2. **Inequality \\( f'''(x) \\leq f(x) \\):** This is a crucial piece of information. It suggests that the rate at which the concavity of the function is changing (as given by the third derivative) is bounded by the function itself. This means that while the function is growing, its growth is controlled or limited by its own value.\n\n3. **Goal \\( f'(x) < 2f(x) \\):** We want to show that the rate of change of the function is less than twice the function's value. \n\nTo approach this, consider the implications of the third derivative being less than or equal to the function. If \\( f'''(x) \\leq f(x) \\), it suggests that the acceleration of the function's growth (since \\( f'''(x) \\) is the derivative of the concavity) is not too large compared to the function itself. This implies that the function's growth is not excessively rapid.\n\nNow, let's think about the relationship between \\( f'(x) \\) and \\( f(x) \\). Since \\( f'(x) \\) is positive and increasing (because \\( f''(x) > 0 \\)), it means \\( f(x) \\) is growing. However, the condition \\( f'''(x) \\leq f(x) \\) ensures that this growth is not too steep. \n\nIf \\( f'(x) \\) were to approach or exceed \\( 2f(x) \\), it would imply a very rapid increase in \\( f(x) \\), potentially leading to a situation where \\( f'''(x) \\) would need to be much larger to sustain such growth. However, since \\( f'''(x) \\leq f(x) \\), this rapid growth is not supported by the third derivative, which acts as a limiting factor.\n\nThus, the condition \\( f'''(x) \\leq f(x) \\) effectively prevents \\( f'(x) \\) from reaching or exceeding \\( 2f(x) \\), ensuring that \\( f'(x) < 2f(x) \\) for all \\( x \\). This is because any attempt for \\( f'(x) \\) to grow too quickly would require \\( f'''(x) \\) to be larger than \\( f(x) \\), which contradicts the given condition.\n\nIn summary, the inequality \\( f'''(x) \\leq f(x) \\) acts as a control on the growth of \\( f(x) \\), ensuring that while \\( f(x) \\) and its derivatives are positive and increasing, the rate of increase of \\( f(x) \\) (as given by \\( f'(x) \\)) remains less than twice the function's value, thus proving \\( f'(x) < 2f(x) \\) for all \\( x \\).\nPrevious attempt failed with: linarith failed to find a contradiction\ncase h\nf : \u211d \u2192 \u211d\nhf : ContDiff \u211d 3 f\nhf1 : \u2200 n \u2264 3, \u2200 (x : \u211d), iteratedDeriv n f x > 0\nhf2 : \u2200 (x : \u211d), iteratedDeriv 3 f x \u2264 f x\nx : \u211d\nh1 : 0 < iteratedDeriv 0 f x\nh2 : 0 < iteratedDeriv 1 f x\nh3 : 0 < iteratedDeriv 2 f x\nh4 : iteratedDeriv 3 f x \u2264 f x\na\u271d : deriv f x \u2265 2 * f x\n\u22a2 False\nfailed\nPlease revise the proof.",

This implies that the expression inside the square root, \\(n^3 + an^2 + bn + c\\), must be a perfect square for some integer \\(n\\).\n\nNow, consider the polynomial \\(f(n) = n^3 + an^2 + bn + c\\). As \\(n\\) becomes very large, the dominant term in this polynomial is \\(n^3\\). This means that for large \\(n\\), the value of \\(f(n)\\) is approximately \\(n^3\\), which is not typically a perfect square because the cube of an integer is rarely a perfect square.\n\nTo see why, note that if \\(n^3\\) were a perfect square, then there would exist some integer \\(m\\) such that \\(m^2 = n^3\\). This implies that \\(n\\) must be a perfect sixth power, i.e., \\(n = k^6\\) for some integer \\(k\\). However, for most integers \\(n\\), this is not the case.\n\nFurthermore, the additional terms \\(an^2 + bn + c\\) in the polynomial \\(f(n)\\) are of lower degree than \\(n^3\\) and thus have a diminishing effect on the overall value of \\(f(n)\\) as \\(n\\) increases. This means that for sufficiently large \\(n\\), the value of \\(f(n)\\) will not be close to a perfect square.\n\nTo make this more concrete, consider the difference between consecutive perfect squares. The difference between \\((m+1)^2\\) and \\(m^2\\) is \\(2m + 1\\), which grows linearly with \\(m\\). On the other hand, the difference between consecutive values of \\(f(n)\\) is primarily influenced by the cubic term, which grows much faster than linearly. Therefore, as \\(n\\) increases, the likelihood that \\(f(n)\\) coincides with a perfect square becomes very small.\n\nThus, for any given integers \\(a, b, c\\), we can always find a sufficiently large positive integer \\(n\\) such that \\(n^3 + an^2 + bn + c\\) is not a perfect square, and consequently, \\(\\sqrt{n^3 + an^2 + bn + c}\\) is not an integer.
